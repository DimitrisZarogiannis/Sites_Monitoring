I hope you mean what you say, girl
I hope you ain’t lying to my face, girl (Lying to my face)
You said you needed some space, girl
I tried to stay out your way, girl
You heard some stories ’bout my past, ayy
Wish we could leave ’em in the past, ayy

"With a new date and new venue, change is in the air for the fondly called “mini burning man” festival known as Lightning in a Bottle. The independent music and art festival presented by The Do LaB is returning next week with a new date and a new location. The 5-day camping festival, taking place May 8th – May 13th has left the San Antonio Recreation Area in Bradley and will instead bring the party to Bakersfield, California at the Buena Vista Aquatic Recreational Area. And Your EDM is giving you the chance to win a pair of 4-Day Festival Passes with access beginning Thursday, May 9th and a OMNOM meet & greet. Lightning In A Bottle remains as one of the few independent music/art festivals in North America. Known for an astounding amount of activities (music and non music related alike), their leave it better policy regarding how festival goers treat the camp/festival grounds during their frivolities, and a never ceasing great lineup; Lightning in a Bottle is a festival you don’t want to miss. Standouts from the lineup this year that I look forward to checking out mostly come from the Woogie Stage. The first festival I ever attended was Woogie Weekend and my philosophy has always been: we don’t dance we Woogie. With artists like Lane 8, Damian Lazarus, Shiba San, Escapade (Walker & Royce + Ardalan), Doc Martin, OMNOM, and Vnssa it seems like fitting philosophy for 2019. I’m sure I’ll be hitting some of the other stages as well and outside of Woogie, I recommend checking out: Disclosure (DJ set), Big Gigantic, Flying Lotus (3D),  1788-L, G Jones, Clozee, and Desert Dwellers. If you have any recommendations for me leave them in the comments!Tickets are available here!

"Earlier this month, Your EDM reported on the word of a trusted source that Holy Ship! would not be returning in 2020. Our source’s information was compounded by a tweet from Gary Richards’ new venture Friendship, saying, “FriendShip is the only Ship #2020.”As it turns out, our source was correct… but only about half way. Holy Ship! will not sail in 2020, but it will host a destination festival for the first time. Rather than sailing on a Caribbean ship, attendees will be staying four days and nights at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic on January 22-26, 2020. It’s also being rebranded: Holy Ship! Wrecked.Holy Ship! and its new iteration will share much of the same beloved features, like sunsets on the beach and sets from favorite artists. However, with the new destination festival factor (and higher price), there are some new features being afforded to attendees that they’ve never had before.The resort in Punta Cana will give attendees twelve pools to choose from, plus four swim-up bars, a lazy river, and an expansive palm-lined beach. In addition, you’ll have access to a full, open bar, complimentary meals in 9 different restaurants (including pizza, sushi, Mediterranean, Brazilian steakhouse, and 24 hour room service, among others), plus, free high speed internet throughout the entire property.There’s also a full service casino with sportsbook, a Jack Nicklaus designed golf course located on site, and luxurious spa… for an additional charge.A Message to the Community from Holy Ship HQ:Prices are per person and start at $1299 for a quad, $1399 for a triple, and $1599 for a double occupancy room. A $250 deposit holds your spot to book a room when the lineup is announced; fans can put down their deposit when tokens go on sale on May 3 at 10am PDT. Only one deposit is required per room at this time. Destinationdominican republicfestivalholy ship!!no boatopen barwreckedLover of all bass music.

"Zedd is gearing up for a huge announcement tomorrow…If we know anything about DJ announcements, usually the less information we get the bigger the news is going to be. The teaser below leaves much to the imagination, as Zedd teases something big (and circular) coming, “TOMORROW.”So far in 2019, Zedd has only dropped “365” with Katy Perry. This could mean another single — or perhaps an entire new album, which fans are keeping their fingers crossed for.His most recent album, , released in 2015. Before that, his debut  released in 2012. Needless to say, he’s overdue for a full album.Speculate all you want today. Tomorrow we’ll have some answers for you.

"As everyone out there knows, Coachella is arguably the biggest, most prestigious music festival in the world. However, one of the more amazing feats that Coachella is able to pull off is that Weekend 2 is always completely different from Weekend 1 with its own unique vibe. The hype train has dissipated considerably, the special guests are totally different, and the crowd has much more of a workman-like vibe to it. You’d be hard pressed to find anybody who goes to Weekend 2 of Coachella as their first festival. For me personally, this was one of the smoothest Coachellas I’d ever experienced.As we covered in our Weekend 1 review, Coachella is a well-oiled machine, and it’s production, organization, and logistics are second to none. This all seamlessly transitions over to Weekend 2, so, in this review, we’ll talk more about the musical acts and how they all fit together in the larger construct of Coachella. My group set out bright and early on Friday, arriving at the festival grounds around 1:30. While some braved the brutally long line of the merch tent, I did what any good EDM fan would do and went straight to the Sahara tent.Coachella took it to the next level in the Sahara tent this year, with an incredible new redesign that recalled the wild visuals of the old Sahara. Last year, the venerable EDM tent got a much need expansion, but the inside of the structure was pretty much just one huge LED screen. This year, the Sahara was adorned with balloons all across the structure’s ceiling and new moving lights along the top and bottom of the stage. There was also a circular LED wrap at the top of the stage too to give the Sahara a bit of the Coachella stage’s feel.Anna Lunoe was the first set I caught, and she played a fun and bouncy set as she bobbed up and down inside her booth on stage. She tried to sing on a couple of tracks too, but the mic was not cooperating with her. However, Anna played an absolutely perfect set for any EDM fan to get their Coachella weekend started with. Up next in the Sahara, was the Daddy Shark himself, Jauz. Sidenote, how in the hell was Jauz scheduled at 3:50 in the afternoon? Needless to say, the crowd size increased considerably for Jauz. Although he was about 15 minutes late, he packed an unbelievable amount of energy and Jauz classics into his set. His stage design also included moving the DJ booth of the stage and into the air with the use of a crane-like apparatus. Jauz did not disappoint.While the Sahara got even more crowded for FISHER after that, I ventured over to check out country artist and reigning album of the year winner Kacey Musgraves at the main stage. I won’t dive too deep into Musgraves’s performance since she’s not an EDM artist, but country felt very out of place on the mainstage, especially in the sweltering heat of that particular time slot (5:50 PM). After the sun went down, the stages and performances started to come to life. RÜFÜS DU SOL put on an amazing performance to a massive crowd at the outdoor theater. Their album Solace was our top album of 2018 over here at Your EDM and it slaps live, I was thoroughly impressed by RÜFÜS.From there I caught Diplo’s Sahara Tent set from the comfort of the beer garden. The Mad Decent head honcho dropped a top notch set, that was way more vibes than bass. His side projects Silk City and LSD were well represented throughout his hour set, less twerking and more grooving, made for a killer and unique set by Diplo. After that it was back to the Outdoor Theatre for DJ Snake. The Frenchman took no prisoners as he dropped a vicious set of dubstep, bass, and trap. It was absolutely wild as the crowd headbanged the night away.Childish Gambino closed out the night and he delivered a fun and funky set. Like Week 1, he was shirtless wearing sweatpants like in the “This is America” video. While Donald Glover crooned on the mainstage, EDM fans started venturing back over to the Sahara tent to catch Kayzo’s set. Kayzo had a full band setup on stage as he was joined by Alex Gaskarth from All Time Low among other special guests. Kayzo seamlessly blended his DJ set with a full on metal/punk show. The new Sahara design was seemingly made for this moment as the lighting perfectly bridged what’s necessary for both rock and dance music, an absolute highlight for sure.Day 2 was a bit lighter on dance music, but it was not without its highlights. I started the day off with L.A. pop-punk-ska band The Interrupters at the Outdoor Theater. Along with temperatures that were 10 degrees cooler than Friday, this was an absolutely perfect way to start the day. Again, not to dwell on non-EDM acts, but the Interrupters were a blast and a throwback. Had they been around in 2006, they certainly would have been one of the most popular bands on KROQ.From there, I made my first trip to the Do Lab. It was slightly expanded from years past, but had the same overall design and vibe. The Do Lab has always been a place for people in the know to check out a totally separate part of Coachella. The lineup is often comprised of up and coming artists, but surprise guests are a staple of the Do Lab, and sometimes, you get huge special guests who pop up, like Major Lazer Weekend 1. Sadly for me, there would not be any special guests quite the caliber of Major Lazer (sorry, Nina Kraviz and Four Tet). That sure doesn’t mean that the Do Lab wasn’t a nice respite from the rest of the festival. I used the Do Lab to escape the madness of the main festival and to catch my breath. I feel like that’s what most everyone there was doing this year, at least my weekendPhoto via Watchara PhotographyAfter fully recharging at the Do Lab, I headed back to the Outdoor Theatre for Bob Moses, which might be my choice for most pleasantly surprising set of the night. There was a lot of good live EDM on the lineup this year, and for me, Bob Moses kind of epitomized it, because it so exceeded my expectations. They went way harder than I thought they would, but still gave me the songs I wanted to hear. The highlight of their set had to have been a live cover of the legendary Prodigy song “Firestarter.” I also got up much closer to the stage and was able to appreciate the setup and visuals of Outdoor Theatre. There were small LED pillars lining the stage and it created a nice effect.I joined up with some friends for some of Weezer’s performance, and it was awesome. Weezer played all of their old school classics, and the main stage’s visuals really started to take over. In fact, for the first time that I can remember, there were lasers on the Coachella Stage. Like, I mean, Eric-Prydz-at-EDC level lasers on the main stage (more on that later). The enjoyment at Weezer was to be short lived because I had to make a journey to see a dance music legend: Aphex Twin.Wow, all I can say is, those warehouse parties in the 90s must have been frickin’ wild, because Aphex Twin took us to another dimension. With gnarly buildups, tons of acid and house beats, a killer low-end and a vibe like no other, Aphex Twin delivered for the crowd who caught him closing out Mojave Tent. While Aphex Twin had his distinctive weird/distorted/tripped-out visuals flashing on stage with pulsating lasers, all I could think of is, wow, so this is what it was like in the old days. This set was more spectacle than anything else, I don’t even remember dancing during the set, just being wowed by the incredible visuals and noise modulation that was happening in front of me. Dance music has come a long ways since Aphex Twin’s heyday, but it was nice to be reminded of the rave roots from whence it came.From there I went back over to the main stage for psychedelic rockers, Tame Impala. All you need to know is that the lasers I mentioned before went off for their signature song “Elephant.” After Tame Impala, there were two choices, Kid Cudi at the Sahara Tent or Bassnectar at Outdoor Theatre. I made the wrong choice and went with Kid Cudi. As I made my way over, the crowd was already overflowing outside the tent well towards the beer garden. As the set opened, I immediately recognized the voice, Kanye West was on stage performing. Thankfully I have a good ear, because I sure couldn’t see anything. I retreated to the beer garden and kind of listened to the set, but even the viewing area of the beer garden was ridiculously packed. This must have been an incredible experience if you were able to see the stage, I was not able to.The final day of the weekend was short and sweet for me. My group took our time getting in, but, for myself, I got well in time for the acts I wanted to see. If you’re reading on this website, you know I’m talking about Zedd and Dillon Francis. Zedd earned himself a prestigious spot on the Coachella stage at the sunset slot. Zedd played an uptempo and energetic mix of his hits and brought out special guests Alessia Cara and Maren Morris, absolutely perfect for the Coachella crowd. Zedd’s stage and visuals were simply amazing, instead of standing beside a blocked table, Zedd was standing inside a round LED rig, that essentially emulated him flying in a spaceship. The massive LED screens of the Coachella stage played bright and vivid visuals that took the crowd from daytime to nighttime and just basically highlighted how big of an artist Zedd is.Unfortunately, I somehow missed Gesaffelstein, but I made up for it and went dead center in the Sahara Tent for Dillon Francis’s set. Dillon played one of the best sets I’ve ever seen from him, as he unleashed tons of IDs and mashups. Old school Dillon fans had to have enjoyed it the most as Dillon dropped a set that consisted much more of house, electro, and moombah, as opposed to trap and dubstep. I’m also glad to report that Gerald survived on stage and didn’t get torn to shreds by the crowd. As always, Dillon showed why he is one of the most reliable names in the game. Dillon is like James Harden or Kevin Durant, you think you’ve got him figured out, and then he hits you with something new, and you’re like, oh yeah, this guy is fucking amazing. All systems go at the #saharatent for @dillonfrancis I got dead center for Dillon's set and it was wild! There's nothing like being in the middle of this crowd. Another great year at #coachellaA post shared by  Mark (@farkmabrick) on After Dillon, I headed over to the main stage for some of Ariana Grande. She was fine, Ariana is an incredible singer and vocalist, and a great songwriter as well. However, she is not the caliber performer of say, Beyonce or Taylor Swift, heck, even Katy Perry. Instead of the N’Sync reunion that happened Weekend 1, Weekend 2 attendees got an awkward guest appearance from Justin Bieber. Through no fault of her own, Ariana’s performance will probably not go down in the annals of Coachella mythology.Oh yeah, I watched NGHTMRE close out the Sahara after that, he was dope, Slander came out and it became Gud Vibrations, the sky is blue and the grass is green. And just like that, Coachella was over. All in all, it was another incredible weekend in the desert. There were no great epiphanies or revelations, Coachella reigns supreme as the premiere music festival in the US, that’s not changing anytime soon. This year’s lineup was one of the most fun and diverse since I’ve been going to the festival, and hopefully it continues next year. Another great thing about Coachella, there’s no doubt, I’ll see you next year in the desert.  alessia caraanna lunoeAphex TwinAriana GrandeBob MosescaliforniaChildish Gambinocoachelladillon francisdiplodj snakeGoldenvoiceIndiojauzkayzoMaren Morrisnghtmrerufus du soltame impalazeddI am a Los Angeles native and lover of all things electro.

"Everyone has been talking about Kanye West‘s massive Sunday Service performance ever since it went down at Coachella weekend two. But, a weekend before — Diplo, Flume and more provided the soundtrack for an offsite wellness retreat of their own dubbed the “Secular Sabbath.”It was much, much more low key than Sunday Service — all about calmness and creativity through the power of music. According to , the two-day event was an oasis in Palm Springs, far enough away from the crowds and the hype of the music festival to debrief.“Secular Sabbath was special,” Diplo revealed to the publication, “and I got to chill out, which is kind of rare.” He further explained, “It’s kind of like the anti-festival.”Diplo performed at Coachella’s arguably most energetic stage, the Sahara Tent, over each weekend of the festival. When he got behind the decks at Two Bunch Palms resort for Secular Sabbath, it was a much different story. People lounged and rested up on “makeshift mattresses” while he “improvised ambient music by candlelight.” Music went from sunset to sunrise.“It was a blast,” Diplo continued. “I got to sit in a hot tub, I took a nap – there was great stuff going on all at the same time. And, I got to play some cool music and I loved it. It’s good to try new things.”Of course, there’s no video footage of Secular Sabbath — but that’s the beauty. It’s great just knowing there are events like this out there that allow music lovers and artists to take a moment to breathe.Mike Milosh of Rhye, along with his girlfriend Genevieve Medow-Jenkins are dedicated to bringing this experience across the globe. The event series has seen installments from South Central, to Mexico, London, Iceland, and beyond.See more of what Seccular Sabbath is doing here. Rolling Stone anti-festivalcoachelladiploFlumepalm springsSecular Sabbath",articles6,['Everyone']

"What So Not took the stage at Ubbi Dubbi fest over the weekend and not even a concussion could stand in his way… literally.Unfortunately, the producer smacked his head on a “low hanging LED wall” while climbing up onto the stage. He didn’t realize how serious it was until he couldn’t figure out how to select what to play. Major red flag.As he reveals via social media: “We worked out pretty quick I’d concussed myself, but decided id deal with it after the set. It was a bazaar experience. Despite jumping around & smiling through it, I almost sat down & just gave up a couple times.”He wants to apologize to anyone at Ubbi Dubbi, if the show seemed a “little off.” We weren’t there, but can bet on What So Not throwing an amazing performance even while concussed.The important thing is that he’s okay and hopefully getting some much needed rest. Yesterday was one of the harder sets of my life. . I smacked my head on a low hanging LED wall climbing on stage. It immediately put me to the floor, but I didn’t realize anything was that serious until moments later I couldn’t figure out how to select what to play. .

"Swedish House Mafia are set to begin their massive new tour this week, May 2, 3, and 4 in Stockholm, Sweden, but a strike from pilots at Scandinavian airline SAS threatens 35,000 people traveling to the shows from abroad.According to Reuters, “667 flights were canceled on Monday and 546 on Tuesday affecting more than 100,000 passengers in two days.” Negotiations broke down this weekend, and it’s unclear when the underlying issues could be resolved.Steve Angello has called upon those at SAS with any power to end the strike and “take care of your business with your pilots and staff.”He continues, “I know it’s a big ask but in the end of the day you should take care of your own like we take care of ours.”The strike presents a major problem for those traveling to Stockholm for the Tele2 Arena shows this week as SAS is part-owned by the government, and it’s one of the main airlines that operate flights to Sweden.(Note, writes , the strike involves only SAS pilots; flight operated by SAS partners are not involved.)If you’re traveling on an SAS operated flight, check the SAS Flight disruption website for updates and flight information. Groove Cartel airlinespilotssteve angellostrikeswedenswedish house mafiaTele2 ArenaLover of all bass music.

"Woodstock 50 has experienced a multitude of issues since being teased. The first obstacle was another festival commonly referred to in the media as Woodstock’s 50th anniversary festival, as it was being held at the original Bethel Woods location. Then, once Woodstock 50 finally announced its lineup, it faced intense scrutiny for the artists chosen to represent the legendary brand. Then Black Keys dropped out.Then, the ticket on-sale was delayed due to lack of proper permitting.Now, Woodstock 50’s main investor, Dentsu Aegis Network, has pulled out of the festival and it is officially cancelled.“It’s a dream for agencies to work with iconic brands and to be associated with meaningful movements,” Dentsu said in a statement. “We have a strong history of producing experiences that bring people together around common interests and causes which is why we chose to be a part of the Woodstock 50th Anniversary Festival.”The company continued, “But despite our tremendous investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees. As a result and after careful consideration, Dentsu Aegis Network’s Amplifi Live, a partner of Woodstock 50, has decided to cancel the festival. As difficult as it is, we believe this is the most prudent decision for all parties involved.”Woodstock 50 was set to feature names like Jay-Z, Chance the Rapper, Imagine Dragons, Carlos Santana, Dead & Company and Halsey. 50th anniversarycancelledfestivalinvestorWoodstockLover of all bass music.

Thankfully, he’s back on the horse with “Buried Alive 2” featuring collaborator Eliozie.As with any Terror Reid track, you can count on sick, unapologetic flow and flawless production. In fact, the sequel to “Buried Alive” rivals the original release with its gripping beat and rather grim wordplay. The new release sounds instinctual or like second nature to the producer — and we’re absolutely stoked to hear the passion behind the music hasn’t been lost.Following harsh criticism of his , Getter ultimately decided to axe it altogether, despite pleas from his most authentic fans to keep going. The news left many wondering the fate of the project or if he’d continue producing at all.This is the answer we’ve been waiting for. No matter what style he’s going with at the moment, we’re beyond thrilled to hear the producer is still making/releasing music. That’s what’s important.Terror Reid is not dead.

"Another destination weekend celebration is drawing parallels with the most notorious festival disaster of all time. However, there’s one major difference between Orange Crush and Fyre Festival — Orange Crush actually happened. Well, kinda.Orange Crush on Tybee Island in Georgia faced severe complications over the weekend when the organizer was arrested, ultimately leading to its demise. Islanders and spring breakers simply continued to enjoy the beach bash even after it was officially canceled.Here’s what happened…According to multiple reports, promoter George “Mikey” Turner was arrested on a felony charge of “serious damage to personal and real property,” plus violations against city ordinances and for promoting an event without a city permit. He also gave a false name to police officers. This put a halt to the entire production.Apparently the charges were made in connection with a house party, during which Turner allegedly charged cover for 200+ attendees. The party was broken up as soon as police arrived and it was later announced that the Turner-associated organized festivities would cease.Just like that, the music festival was canceled overnight. Orange Crush did enjoy some music and partying throughout the weekend despite this unfortunate turn of events.Read more on Orange Crush here.The Tybee Island Police Department had arrested the promoter of Orange Crush on felony charges along with city ordinance violations pertaining to promoting an unpermitted event.

"Instead of actually going to Coachella, Instagram influencer Gabbie Hanna decided to prove how easy it is to fake going to Coachella. The catch: it still turned out to be a lot of work. However, she saved a lot of money and still got the engagement she wanted from the weekend on social media.The inspiration for her fake Coachella posts came after learning that some fellow influencers double up on outfits and then pretend they’re posting from both weekends. In reality, over weekend two they’re at home in their PJs, still recovering from weekend one, miles away from Indio, California.Why do they do this? For the followers.Hours upon hours of planning outfits, packing and getting ready, a few photo shoots later, and plenty of work in Photoshop — finally, Gabbie had her content. It was so convincing that she had people who knew she wasn’t at Coachella still messaging her things like, Here’s the point… According to Gabbie, Coachella is an “investment.” However, she feels that it’s a “lot of work for something you’re probably not enjoying.” At least, if you’re an influencer doing it all for the ‘gram.

At any one time, one artist might be the most streamed in the world, and then the next it’s another.

"Last week, CHVRCHES made posts on social media condemning Marshmello for working with abusers Chris Brown and Tyga. In their post, they wrote: “We like and respect Mello as a person but working with people who are predators and abusers enables, excuses and ultimately tacitly endorses that behavior. That is not something we can or will stand behind.”The statement reignited the debate as to whether (or when) past abusers could possibly be forgiven for their actions, or whether people should separate the artist and their art. There were vocal minorities on both sides, but CHVRCHES lead singer Lauren Mayberry has received the worst of it.Across two separate posts on Instagram, she shares DMs sent by outraged Brown and Tyga fans who hurl insults and threats of death and rape toward her.These are independent of — or perhaps fueled by — Chris Brown’s response to CHVRCHES on Instagram, in which he said: “BUNCH OF LOSERS. these are the type of people I wish walked in front of a speeding bus full of mental patients, Keep groveling over your own insecurities and hatred.”Tyga, to his credit, responded with a bit more class: “Where [sic] all God’s children. Everyone makes mistakes no ones perfect. Let’s keep the energy positive.”See the DMs sent to Mayberry below, who has since disabled comments on her last two posts in light of persistent and constant harassment. More examples of death threats can be seen in her most recent highlighted story on Instagram. The last “bitch” really helped get the point across 🤣 Angry men on the internet can call me all the names they want. I still think domestic abuse is wrong. Peace out, internet.

"Amazon is getting into the music streaming game — big time.This goes much further than Prime Music. According to , Amazon’s next big plan will rival the likes of Spotify, Apple Music and more. The platform will reportedly offer high-quality audio for approximately $15 per month.Industry sources say the new platform is expected to launch before the end of 2019.“It’s a better bit rate, better than CD quality,” said one source. “Amazon is working on it as we speak: they’re currently scoping out how much catalog they can get from everyone and how they’ll ingest it.”Currently, the best source for Hi-Fi music streaming is TIDAL, at $19.99 per month. The service offers CD-quality lossless streaming at 44.1 kHz / 16 bit.Another US-based music industry source told : “Think about it: Amazon will have every tier of recorded music covered, from free streaming through to limited catalog via Prime, a full ‘Spotify rival’ in Music Unlimited and a hi-definition service – in addition to vinyl, CD, merch and more. We haven’t seen anything near what they’re capable of in music yet.”Amazon could easily shake things up.

GOODDAY PEASANTS.”Compared to CHVRCHES thought-out and conscientious message of respect women’s safety, Brown’s comment reflects exactly the person the band accused him of being.The band has not yet responded to Brown’s statement, but he’s likely done more than enough on his own.

"It’s been a couple weeks since LSD’s album came out, and through Diplo sets at Coachella and a surprise set from Major Lazer at the Do Lab, we still hadn’t seen LSD perform live. Surely, capturing the crazy aesthetic from their music videos would be incredibly difficult.But, the group of Labrinth, Sia, and Diplo went on Ellen yesterday to perform their new single “No New Friends.” The set was filled with bright colors and kooky decorations, as well as a supporting cast of children and dancers. The performance itself is just about flawless — Sia is sat on a tiger, doing her thing, while Labrinth bounces around with a microphone and Diplo sits atop an elephant with some bongos.The performance is a sort of perfect representation of the childlike wonder that LSD hopes to bring to their brand. However, don’t expect to see them in your city anytime soon.

Whereas  only had one collaboration,  demonstrates the connections that 1788-L has made in just the last 8 months — much of which was spent on the road touring — with a collaboration on each track (and totto returning for one of them): Slooze, Deathpact, totto, and Josh Pan.Perhaps the most awaited track on the EP is the Josh Pan collaboration, first debuted at 1788-L’s debut show in LA for Brownies & Lemonade in 2018. It’s the first and only vocal track from the producer, giving it just that much more of a unique position within his discography.

"Miami City Council will vote on May 9 whether to renew or revoke Ultra Music Festival’s license to hold their event on Virginia Key for a second year, but Virginia Key has already made it clear that it doesn’t want Ultra back.A preliminary meeting two weeks ago discussed the possibility of Ultra returning. Commissioner Joe Carollo against voiced his intent to vote against the festival, as he did last November. City Manager Emilio Gonzalez and Commissioner Keon Hardemon both expressed support for the festival, but will it be enough?In a meeting on Tuesday, the Virginia Key Advisory Board voted against Ultra, recommending that the city of Miami revoke its license agreement. (Note: this vote has no direct result on the vote from the Miami City Council.) This decision was influenced in large part by a report from University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, which outlined the stress the festival was causing on wildlife in the area.“Ultra was causing short-term, acute stress on our fish,” said Danielle McDonald, an associate professor of marine biology at the university. “We are using it as a canary in the coal mine.”Read the full report here, and stay tuned for May 9th when the Miami City Council votes.BREAKING: Fish suffered excess stress levels because of loud music at the Ultra Music Festival, according to University of Miami researchers.

"I have to say, as much as mental illness is a terrible thing, I’m very glad that speaking about it has become so accepted, because it allows for beautiful pieces of music like PURGE’s new song “Never Let This Go” to be released.That isn’t to say that speaking about mental illness is a new phenomenon. Artists have been expressing feelings of depression, loss, anxiety, and more for decades. But it’s now becoming more common to be even more open, with more (potentially disturbing) real imagery of depression and loss.In the music video for “Never Let This Go,” various scenes of self harm, anger, loss, and depression are laid bare. It can be tough to watch for those struggling with the same issues, but for those who can’t quite wrap their head around what it’s like, it’s a stark insight into the lives of those afflicted.I caught up with PURGE ahead of the release to ask him questions about mental health, the video, and his inspirations for the music.

"There are so many albums coming out this year, it would be hard for anyone to narrow down their most anticipated releases. For me, however, Party Favor’s debut album  has been on my must-listen list since it was first announced last year.Compared to Party Favor’s early tracks like “Bap U” and “Bust ‘Em,” is more, well… layered. There’s a greater diversity to the sounds he uses while still keeping things Party Favor oriented, with collaborations from GTA, graves, A$AP Ferg & Juicy J, Salvatore Ganacci, and more.Don’t confuse my words though,  is still absolutely a party album. It gets a little softer toward the middle with “Be Ok” feat EZI and “Dreams” feat KingJet, but these are both bookended by bangers through and through. And, in my opinion, the hardest track on the album doesn’t even come until the penultimate track, “RBRBRB” with Hex Cougar.“Wasabi” with Salvatore Ganacci is just as fun as you’d expect, “Back” with OG Maco & Project Pat sounds like a great callback to Party Favor’s “Bap U” style, and album-closer “All Of It” wraps everything up in an auto-tuned whirlpool of sound. is out now, via Party Favor’s newly minted Area 25 imprint.

"Swedish House Mafia are back in full force and they’re reworking one of their classics in the most epic way possible. An orchestral version of “One” is set to premiere on May 2, 2019 at their homecoming Stockholm performance, according to DJ MagAfter falling silent for years, the group’s massive following is eager to hear new Swedish House Mafia — even if that means a revival of one of their greatest tracks. “One” was recently named the top song in Tomorrowland’s history, and the widespread love and appreciation for the track stretches beyond belief.Swedish House Mafia has confirmed a series of special performances, festival appearances, and most recently a stop in Ibiza (full list of dates here). They kick off a new era on May 2, 3, and 4, 2019 in Stockholm, with this anticipated release on the heels of the opening day.If you’re able to catch Swedish House Mafia on tour this year, bet on “One” being a staple part of the soundtrack. Fans can also expect to hear hits including “Don’t You Worry Child,” “Save the World, “Miami 2 Ibiza,” and more. Will the group deliver on new music, however? We sure hope so.Stay tuned. DJ MagRukes.com dj magoneorchestrashmswedish house mafiatourWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Yesterday, news reports stated that a massive herpes outbreak in Southern California was linked to Coachella. According to statistics interpreted from app HerpAlert, there had been a 2,038% increase in reported herpes cases, or a total of 1,105 reports.However, the reality of the situation is a bit less severe. Jose Arballo, public information officer for the Riverside Department of Public Health, said his agency has not seen any evidence pointing to these reports being true.“I reached out to our lab departments, disease control and our HIV and STD program and none of them reported a spike in herpes cases,” Arballo said.Realistically, the reports should have set off red flags immediately anyway. Herpes symptoms rarely appear so soon after contracting the virus, or in such large numbers.Lynn Marie Morski, HerpAlert’s medical director,  has since clarified the company’s findings.“There were many coming to get medication to treat and prevent flares,” she said, stating that the 1,105 inquiries made on the app were not necessarily new cases, but people using the platform for various other reasons. “We see it as people deciding to take proactive care of their health and the health of those they may interact with over the weekend. We do not have a number of diagnosed new cases, as sometimes we cannot determine via their history and photos, so we have to advise they see a provider in person.”So, while the herpes outbreak has been avoided for now, it’s still a good reminder to always practice safe sex and never be afraid to ask a new partner if they’ve been recently tested. NME coachellahealth officialsherpesoutbreakReactrespondstatementLover of all bass music.

"Gesaffelstein is truly the prince of darkness. Not only did he create an utterly eerie and thrilling Coachella experience — he brought the blackest of blacks to the stage.The technology known as Vantablack is a designer type black — “a very scarce, very expensive, and quite fragile material.” Made by Surrey NanoSystems in the UK, it’s the truest of blacks. The world’s blackest black in fact.According to a report by , the material is quite disorienting to the brain, as it erases visible features on any 3D surface. Unless you saw this tripped out blackness live, in person, it’s a little difficult to wrap your head around. Although, videos from the performance will give you an idea of Gesaffelstein’s blackout set.Show producer Matthias Leullier explains it best, via : “One of our sound engineers was onstage and found himself in the monolith. [He] became confused and lost his balance. He fell, hit the surface, and I was like, ‘Okay that’s $20,000.’”The Vantablack screens give off the sense of infinite darkness.

"Today, Marshmello released a new song “Light It Up” with Chris Brown and Tyga. Before we had a chance to publish a review of the track, CHVRCHES spoke out, condemning Marshmello for working with two individuals either accused of or arrested for abuse against women.As we wrote at the time, “Tyga was sued for for sexual battery, fraud, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress in 2013 by one of the women in his “Make It Nasty” video. In 2009, Chris Brown turned himself in to authorities and was arrested after beating his then girlfriend, Rihanna, leaving her with visible facial injuries which required hospitalization.”The question then becomes should others work with these artists knowing the actions they’ve taken? It’s not a new question by any means — the same question was directed at Skrillex not too long ago for putting out a song with XXXTENTACION.

"DJ Snake just dropped the biggest hip hop collaboration of the year. His new track out this morning, “Enzo,” features verses from Sheck Wes, Offset, 21 Savage, and Gucci Mane.As someone who isn’t particularly a fan of any of these artists, I had my reservations about this track before it even came out. However, having listened to it this morning, it’s a smooth and down played hip hop tune that doesn’t try to flex (too hard).All of the verses are crystal clear and pretty much free of auto-tune, meaning you can listen and even sing along with ease.On the other hand, the production is really basic, as good as it sounds. There’s nothing in it that really stands out, no small embellishments or quirks that make you think back, “Damn, that was dope.”Overall, “Enzo” is a solid hip hop tune that will definitely get heavy radio play and afford Snake the opportunity for some great special guests at shows in 2019. Could it be better? Sure, anything could. But it does the trick. Listen below.Speaking with Zane Lowe at Beats 1 this morning, DJ Snake also revealed his album is coming out this summer. He says it looks like a “carnival” with a bunch of different styles, but he tells Lowe to be patient and wait to find out who else is on it. Rukes.com 21 Savagedj snakegucci maneNew Albumoffsetsheck wessummer releaseLover of all bass music.

"Justin Bieber is firing back after  host Morgan Stewart ripped his Coachella performance to shreds. He joined Ariana Grande on stage to perform “Sorry” at the music festival over the weekend — and here’s the brutal review via Nightly Pop for reference.“I did not realize it was going to be that bad,” Morgan says as she quite literally laughs out loud.Well, Justin isn’t letting this one slide. After returning to the stage for the first time in two years, the pop star is standing up for himself and speaking out against the harsh criticism. “It’s people like you that are bullies at school that are making kids suicidal,” he writes.“Imagine if you spent even half the time you spend laughing at other peoples expense actually building people up.” Very good point.Ariana also chimes in with a since-deleted tweet… “People are so lost. One day everybody that works at all them blogs will realize how unfulfilled they are and purposeless what they’re doing is and hopefully shift their focus elsewhere. that’s gonna be a beautiful ass day for them! i can’t wait for them to feel lit inside.”She continues, “i don’t like when people try to ruin beautiful moments for my friends that’s all. have a good day.”This is a double-edged sword, because on one hand entertainers are subject to criticism — but does it have to be that way? It does seem as though Bieber was blatantly lip-synching during his surprise cameo — but should he be torn down for it? He certainly wasn’t trying to hide it after the fact. We’re gonna go with a hard no, siding with Justin on this one as his appearance was pure, fun (and apparently unplanned) entertainment.See all the tweets below and move along.@Morgan_Stewart just saw a video of you ripping me to shreds saying I was lip-syncing. They played the song and i just sang overtop of it.. regardless why spend your time tearing people down.

"Kayzo has been working hard these past eight months to blur the line between emo, rock, and EDM more than ever before. (Though, it could be said he started way back with , as well.) Teaming up with names like xo sad, Underoath, Our Last Night, and Bless The Fall, he’s been doing a terrific job of it. Now today with his new single “Up In Flames,” featuring All Time Low’s Alex Gaskarth, it seems he’s finally hit the perfect 50/50 split.“Up In Flames” sounds like it could easily be an All Time Low original, due in large part to Gaskarth’s vocals. It also sounds equally like a Kayzo song, from the production and overall vibe of the track. But as AP notes, Gaskarth had a heavy influence on the track from top to bottom, as well.“The song itself and the production behind it has become my best example to date of the blurred line of rock and electronic music that I am continuously working to create,” Kayzo explains.As for the song’s concept, Gaskarth explained the meaning behind it, which is captured in the video.“‘Up In Flames’ is about passion and the juxtaposition of the metaphor of fire itself,” he says. “[It’s] the way it can be used to describe someone igniting a room when you see them, vs. the idea of burning it all down and starting again when things go wrong.”Kayzo’s still-untitled second album is due out sometime this year.

"My first thought when I learned about the Martin Garrix, Macklemore, and Fall Out Boy collaboration “Summer Days” was, “Why?” My second thought was, “Wait, I’m  curious what this could sound like…”Well, it’s out now and I can say that I did not expect it to sound like this. It’s hard to say I had any particular expectation for “Summer Days,” really. But the last thing I expected was a funky, French house-influence indie rock number.It’s heavily characterized by a funky bassline, crisp electric guitar, and Justice-esque vocal effects that give it that French touch. Fall Out Boy’s Patrick Stump takes care of the chorus, and also has a verse in there, while Macklemore’s unique rap style remains the most salient vocal takeaway from the track.“Summer Days” is hard to imagine getting played out on typical EDM main stages; but, the potential for remixes is ripe.

"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas… the same cannot apparently be said for Coachella. According to STD diagnosis app HerpAlert, there’s been a massive increase in the number of reported cases of herpes directly following the festival in Indio, California these past two weekends.Reportedly, the site usually sees around 12 cases on any given day. However, after the first two days of Coachella, the site received over 250 cases. All in all, there’s been a 2,083% increase in reports, and over 1,100 reports in the time the festival was going on.HerpAlert works by allowing users to upload photos of their “situation” which is then reviewed by medical professionals contracted by the app. Turnaround time, according to TMZ, is usually very brisk, around 2 hours.And as another report noted, the biggest previous spike was during Oscars weekend 2018, when they got a mere 60 cases a day.

"Marshmello and CHVRCHES released their collaborative single “Here With Me” on March 8, a whimsical and really delightful song that the two performed on Jimmy Kimmel as well as at Coachella.Today, Marshmello released a new song called “Light It Up” with Tyga and Chris Brown, both of whom are artists who have been either accused or convicted of abuse against women. Tyga was sued for for sexual battery, fraud, invasion of privacy, and infliction of emotional distress in 2013 by one of the women in his “Make It Nasty” video. In 2009, Chris Brown turned himself in to authorities and was arrested after beating his then girlfriend, Rihanna, leaving her with visible facial injuries which required hospitalization.In light of the new song, CHVRCHES released a statement on social media condemning Marshmello’s decision to work with either artist:Marshmello has yet to respond at time of publishing.pic.twitter.com/oAjbgGf1ef— CHVRCHΞS (@CHVRCHES) April 25, 2019  abuse against womenChris BrownCHVRCHESLight It Upmarshmellonew songtygaLover of all bass music.

"Kanye West‘s Sunday Service at Coachella was absolutely massive — and according to a report, there were over 50,000 spectators there for the gospel-inspired set.Coachella’s “production sources” were the ones who fed TMZ the 50k tally. They claimed to have been counting as people rushed in. Once the gates were open, fans were literally running across the field to get a good spot, so they must have been counting pretty quickly.As  tells it: “Coachella averages about 100k total attendees every weekend, so for half to show up just for ‘Ye is a really big deal.” Other sources are questioning whether this is true.While the tally sounds quite iffy, the performance was surely uplifting, beautifully composed, and star-studded, with A-list guests including the entire Kardashian clan, DMX, Donald Glover, Lizzo, Kid Cudi, Chance the Rapper and many, many more.The iconic rapper/producer and friends performed tracks including “Jesus Walks,” “All Falls Down,” and a brand new debut — “Water.” All sprinkled within hymns and well known spiritual songs.I attended Sunday Service myself, as just a little pixel in the photos below. Yes — I was one of those that stayed up all night and got in line early to get a spot at the rail for Ye. Regardless of the amount of people there, it was amazing — 50k or not. That, I can confirm.A bird's eye view of @kanyewest's #SundayService courtesy of @coachella. pic.twitter.com/4RyMkZjFWB— HYPEBEAST Music (@hypebeastmusic) April 22, 2019Say what you want about Kanye West, but this man is truly a once in a lifetime visionary.

"“Last All Night (Koala)” by Oliver Heldens is an absolute classic in the future house world. It’s one of the first tracks that truly embodied the genre moniker (apart from Heldens’ own “Gecko”) and it was the song that truly rocketed him to worldwide fame. As such, it’s not uncommon to go back and listen to it for a bit of nostalgia. However, what we saw this morning on Spotify gave us a bit of a surprise.Instead of the track title, users were met with … well, I’m not sure what to call it, but it didn’t say “Last All Night,” that’s for sure. It seems there was some error or miscommunication with Heldens’ distributor or perhaps Spinnin’ Records, because it reads: “Koala – Radio Edit; DO NOT USE THIS VERSION TO LICENSE OUT PLEASE USE NLZ541401138 – Radio Edit vocal v…”A fan first noticed the error and tagged Heldens on Twitter, to which he responded, “Lol what up w this? @SpinninRecords.” So far, the label hasn’t responded and the error remains up as of 10:38am PDT.See it for yourself on Spotify or check out the screenshot below. Of course the track is still the same and it isn’t really a  deal in the grand scheme of things, but it’s still pretty hilarious.

"During the Gucci Gang (Lil Pump, Gucci Mane, and Smokepurpp) set at Coachella two nights ago, one of the orb set decorations lining the top of the Sahara Tent (seen in the photo above) somehow experienced a catastrophic failure and fell down into the crowd, landing on a group of people and striking one woman in the head.A Reddit thread was created about the incident, drawing testimonials from over a dozen people who were either witness to the event, were near the victim, or actually helped to find medics and other staff. According to /u/nzsupreme on reddit, who was apparently also struck by the ball, it was the metal bracket holding the ball to the overall structure that ended up striking the woman.Other witnesses in the thread report seeing the woman, only identified as Caroline by friends, unconscious and bleeding directly after the ball fell approximately 60 feet from the ceiling. Once EMT arrived, her eyes were open and she was still breathing. Another user, /u/Heywhatsup2866, claiming to be a friend of Caroline, said that she went into surgery for a “skull fracture and staples/stitches for the lacerations.” She is reportedly now conscious and surrounded by family — that comment was made approximately 15 hours ago.@SHOWme_theGOODS on Twitter was actually filming at the moment the ball fell onto the crowd, and had the phone knocked out of his hands. Yelling from the surrounding people is indicative of the panic and urgency of the situation.Here’s the video that Kyle got when the balloon fell on him and that girl…..you can hear everyone screaming for help as it’s laying on the floor and gets picked up by someone else. #Coachella2019 #SarahaTent #PropAccident pic.twitter.com/9bqRMU3B5z— Scrambled Haigs (@SHOWme_theGOODS) April 23, 2019 coachellahospitalInjurysaharaset propstable conditionsurgeryLover of all bass music.

"Coachella is one of the only music festivals where fashion is almost just as important as the performances — and Eric Prydz chose an interesting attire for Coachella weekend 2. He hit the Yuma tent as Cirez D, rocking a shirt with bold lettering “FUCK (Y)OU,” with the “Y” representing his Pryda logo.While there’s been some speculation he was sending a message or making a statement, we highly doubt this. Years ago, the “FUCK (Y)OU” design was actually once sold as official merchandise (link broken), so why wouldn’t he wear it? Nonetheless, the shirt has caused a bit of a stir on social media. We believe people are looking too far into this.A tweet from the man himself further reassures that he had no beef with any part of the festival nor the experience… Just like the majority of artists and attendees, he had a great time.Thank you @coachella !!

"About a month ago, Diplo told that he was trying to dip his toe in the country world, following the announcement that he’d be headlining Stagecoach’s first official after-hours party. Well, that day is here, as Diplo debuts a new project he calls Thomas Wesley (his real name, minus “Pentz”) with the first single, “So Long” featuring Cam.In that same interview, Diplo mentions Cam as someone with whom he wanted to do a song, along with Zac Brown, Sam Hunt, and Thomas Rhett.“So Long” is a downtempo and chill tune that more so uses country elements than is a country song itself. A bit of violin here, a bit of country twang there (courtesy of Cam), and you’ve got yourself a hit. Add in the four on the floor beat, and you have a crossover that can hit the radio and get played out at festivals.Check out the lyric video for “So Long” by Thomas Wesley below.It looks like there’s a music video coming, as well, complete with Diplo really struggling to be a cowboy. It’s hilariously on brand, both emphasizing his new sound as well as acknowledging his own history as a city boy.

"There are a lot of things that could be considered coincidence, and then there are things that just can’t. Yesterday, within the span of ten minutes, Martin Garrix, Macklemore, and Fall Out Boy all posted pictures with the caption, “I got this feeling on a Summer day,” with the ‘S’ capitalized in “summer” in each of them. (For the record, the names of seasons are not capitalized.)None of these artists have hinted at working with any of the others prior to these postings yesterday, so for them to do so suddenly surely means something is afoot.“I got this feeling on a summer day” is the widely known opening lyric to “I Love It” by Icona Pop, though the group, nor that single, don’t seem to have anything to do with this new revelation.We’ll definitely be keeping a close eye on these three artists as the week progresses – stay tuned to Your EDM for new updates!I got this feeling on a Summer day pic.twitter.com/wpUbqqAdGR— Fall Out Boy (@falloutboy) April 20, 2019 Rukes.com collaborationFall out boyMacklemoreMartin Garrixsocial mediasummerteaserLover of all bass music.

"One of the coolest things about MySpace was the ability to add a song to your profile that would auto-play when anyone visited your page. It was your own badge of singular identity, even though only a handful of songs were typically chosen to be represented and regularly went viral.In the modern age, Facebook reigns — and it’s quiet. However, a new beta feature being rolled out to select accounts this weekend lets users at least pick a featured song to share on their profile. News of this integration first broke October 2018, but a new batch of users suddenly saw the feature go live on their page this weekend.The problem, of course, is that very few people actually go on their own profile pages, let alone scroll down in search of new tiles they can edit. Another problem, though it’s less of a problem and more of a main difference between Facebook and MySpace, is that the new function won’t auto-play the song you choose. In fact, most people would probably consider that an improvement.Many users still won’t see the feature, but you might be one of the few!

"Weekend two of Coachella wraps up tonight, and with it, the epic Coachella season. Stagecoach will return next weekend as the next Goldenvoice festival in the area, along with Staff Pro event security. However, reports of contracted security experiencing race inequality, abhorrent living conditions, and little to no accommodations from staff have begun to spread after a couple of workers became fed up.Antonio Cannady, who worked as festival security under Staff Pro, subcontracted to BMW Nationwide Security, wrote a long account of the working conditions that he eventually sent to The Daily Beast. In it, he describes how workers, many of them destitute upon arrival, were forced to sleep on hard, wet grass as they either couldn’t afford a tent or it blew away in the wind.As for the accounts of racism, Cannady included photos of the lot he was staying in compared to “their lot,” a comparatively pristine assortment of bespoke tents for the majority-white security staff. Cannady is African-American.“On my campground there are like three or four companies, all minority-owned by black folks,” he explained. “Now if you go across the field like I showed in the pictures, those are majority-white folks on different campgrounds.”Cannady also spoke about the catering for security, who were often asked to work 12-16 hour shifts during the event. “Outside the initial meal upon of our arrival, you were pretty much ‘shit out of luck’ if you didn’t bring food with you, which some people didn’t.”Head here for the full exclusive on , and Cannady’s own account here. coachellafestivalliving conditionsreportssecuritystaff proWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

Bringing along Chance the Rapper, as well as DMX, for the performance, West conducted a diverse 28-song set that ranged from covers to originals.According to observers, West left most of the actual vocals to the choir, “though he did take the mic for ‘All Falls Down’ and ‘Jesus Walk,'” says Consequence of Sound.See clips from the performance as well as the set list below.kanye debuted a new song called “water” at #sundayservice 😭🌊🙏pic.twitter.com/ob0RcVtMLU— Genius (@Genius) April 21, 2019LIFT YOURSELF #Kanye #SundayService pic.twitter.com/1z236gyzJu— 🌊トーサー • 〔≡_≡〕 🌊 (@somegaveall) April 21, 2019Chance at Kanye's #SundayService getting moves off. #Coachella pic.twitter.com/hPeYssDkvY— HypeHub Music (@HypeHubMusic) April 21, 2019ALL FALLS DOWN #Kanye #SundayService #CollegeDropout pic.twitter.com/SkMqUmXwh6— 🌊トーサー • 〔≡_≡〕 🌊 (@somegaveall) April 21, 2019this moment with kanye, cudi, chance and DMX really got me 😩 #SundayService #coachella pic.twitter.com/uSExFWvfzw— Genius (@Genius) April 21, 2019Setlist:Summer Madness (Kool & The Gang cover)

"Following the release of his new album and before his first performance at Coachella a week ago, fans were skeptical of Gesaffelstein. Would it be the same sort of poppy mish mash on , or would it be a return to his original style, or somewhere in between?Thankfully, the answer was about 80/20 in favor of his old style, and his Coachella set was wildly entertaining and impeccably produced. With a very unique vibe in mind and a powerful, techno-laden set that had everyone’s blood pumping, no one really went home unsatisfied.Now Gesaffelstein is taking his set on the road with 9 new dates announced in November. Having already been announced for Governors Ball in May, he adds stops in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Denver, Boston, and more.Tickets for the tour will go on sale on Friday, April 26 at 10am local time.

"More often than not, people take the easy way out when it comes to passwords. There are so many services that require a password that it’s easier to choose an easy one than a complicated one; but in exchange for ease, you lose security.A new survey conducted by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and the Department for Digital, Media, and Sport (DCMS) in the UK has found that a staggering number of people actually use musicians and pop culture for their passwords, many of them across different services.Among the top musicians are Blink-182 (285,706), 50 Cent (191,153), Eminem (167,983), Metallica (140,841), and Slipknot (140,833), while Superman (333,139), Naruto (242,749), Tigger (237,290), Pokemon (226,947), and Batman (203,116) lead the fictional front.As Consequence of Sound points out in their coverage of the survey, yes, this is a UK specific study. Regardless, if any of those passwords look familiar, you should change yours immediately.“Nobody should protect sensitive data with something that can be guessed, like their first name, local football team or favorite band,” Dr Ian Levy, NCSC Technical Director explained. “Using hard-to-guess passwords is a strong first step and we recommend combining three random but memorable words. Be creative and use words memorable to you, so people can’t guess your password.”If EDM fans were surveyed, it’s not unlikely that artists like Skrillex, Excision, or Illenium (or variations thereof) would be similarly popular.Consult the full list of passwords here and act accordingly. Consequence of Sound musicianpasswordpop cultureStudysurveyuk specificWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Tickets for Woodstock 50 were intended to go on sale today, but have been indefinitely put on hold. News about the postponement broke this weekend, as booking agents were informed of the delay and brought the news to Billboard.Now, according to Pitchfork, the reason for the postponement is due to the lack of a “mass gathering permit” from the village of Watkins Glen, where the festival is supposed to take place. Without a permit, tickets can’t go on sale.Writes , “Tim O’Hearn, administrator of Schuyler County (which includes the village of Watkins Glen), Watkins Glen International filed a mass gathering permit application to DOH on Monday, April 15. ‘The health department is reviewing to determine if a conditional permit may be issued that would allow for ticket sales to commence. At this point there is no on-sale date set.'”Festival organizers maintain that the event, which will be headlined by The Killers, Jay-Z, Dead & Company, Miley Cyrus, and more, will not be cancelled. mass gatheringOn Salepermitspostponedticketswatkins glenWoodstockLover of all bass music.

"How do you top bringing out NSYNC as your special guest at Coachella? In the ’90s, you couldn’t — but nowadays, Justin Bieber will do the trick. Ariana Grande closed the annual festival out for the second weekend last night with a guest appearance from Bieber, which “by all accounts” says Consequence of Sound, wasn’t planned.Bieber performed his hit “Sorry,” which was co-produced by Skrillex, but it was really more of an appearance than a performance as he sort of ambled about and lip-sang into the microphone. The abruptness of the whole situation more than likely contributed to his unpreparedness.“I haven’t been on stage in two years — I came out here, I had no idea I was going to be on stage tonight,” Bieber explained to the audience. “[…] I had to get my groove back, I had to get my swag back.”After all, it was only about a month ago that Bieber announced he was taking a break from music for a bit to repair “some of the deep rooted issues that I have.” His performance last night isn’t to say that all those issues have been resolved, but it seems he’s certainly on his way.He also took the opportunity to announce to the crowd that his new album was “coming soon.”See clips from the surprise appearance below.💡 | Ariana performed Sorry with Justin Bieber tonight on Arichella!(1/2) pic.twitter.com/W1tszb5Yl2— AG6 info (@AG6info) April 22, 2019Ariana Grande brought out Justin Bieber and then he announced a new album on the way pic.twitter.com/xn8KyUO2Jv— Nicholas Shutes (@nshutes31) April 22, 2019AFTER 2 YEARS JUSTIN IS PERFORMING WITH ARIANA AND HE JUST ANNOUNCED A NEW ALBUM IS COMING SOON THE TEARS ARE REAL YALL I'M FCKN SHAKING RIGHT NOW https://t.co/KadA02LaLS— andrea (@bieberhslut) April 22, 2019 Ariana Grandecoachellajustin bieberskrillexsorrySpecial GuestLover of all bass music.

"On Saturday, Martin Garrix, Macklemore, and Fall Out Boy all shared the phrase “I got this feeling on a Summer day” on social media, along with a picture. Between the sameness of the caption and the timing of the posts (all within 10 minutes), it was clear that these three were in cahoots and were teasing something.What we didn’t realize at the time was that STMPD RCRDS had already teased the collaboration a couple days prior on YouTube, called “Summer Days.”The YouTube teaser is only 15 seconds long and doesn’t give away very much, even going so far as to have the last five seconds of the video be silent. However, some fans are guessing that the new blank spaces at the beginning of the title are a placeholder for “On April the 26th.” However, it’s really the 25th as Garrix confirmed on Instagram. 'Summer Days' together with @Macklemore and @PatrickStump of @FallOutBoy will be out on Thursday (2 PM CEST / 8 AM EDT)! 🌴A post shared by  Martin Garrix (@martingarrix) on Stay tuned for this release, it’s out bright and early! Rukes.com collaborationFall out boyMacklemoreMartin GarrixPatrick Stumpstmpd rcrdsSummer DaysteaserLover of all bass music.

", the hotly anticipated movie with Ryan Reynolds and Justice Smith, comes out soon on May 10! But before we get to that, the soundtrack for the film has begun to come out, starting with a new song from Kygo and Rita Ora, “Carry On.”It’s actually kind of crazy to think that it took a major motion picture to finally get these two on a track together, yet here we are. “Carry On” features Kygo’s predictable soft piano melodies, tambourine, and steel drums, but Ora’s voice truly carries the track. Her emotion comes through crystal clear in the recording, conveying the theme of the movie along with it.Check it out below.Walking alone and the shores are longing

Listeners can tune in to hear one of the many legendary Avicii tracks every hour and, at 14:00 CET, an hour-long best of Avicii mix will be played.If there’s any festival that demonstrates how much of an impact Avicii had on the world, it’s Tomorrowland.Tomorrowland – One World Radio is the official digital radio and content platform of Tomorrowland, available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week with the Tomorrowland app or on tomorrowland.com. Rukes.com Anniversaryaviciideathone world radiotomorrowlandTributeLover of all bass music.

With three channels, over 60 artists, and a professional camera team, it often felt like we were getting a better show than we would have if we were really there in person. (Case in point: Billie Eilish, whose crowd we would not have wanted to try and get through.)This year, Coachella will live stream weekend 2 for the first time ever. Previously, the stream on weekend 2 would consist of highlights of weekend 1 as well as repeats of interviews and such. Now, full sets from many different artists than weekend 1 will be streamed, and a lot of them are coming from the Yuma tent.Peep the schedule below:Friday, April 19:Coachella Curated:Yuma:The stream will start on April 19th starting at 5 PM Pacific and run through the 21st of April 2019.

She also graced the cover of a special edition of the  issue alongside other incredible female artists, Rezz and Tokimonsta.TMNShe and many others have helped pave the way for aspiring female figures in the dance/electronic realm.

Peekaboo is an expected but wholly welcome addition to the lineup in 2019 — no doubt he’s earned it. Boogie T returns for the second year in a row, but this time he’s also bringing along his live Boogie T.Rio set. Liquid Stranger comes back to Lost Lands, and he’s bringing Wakaan with him for a sound camp takeover. And finally, Whipped Cream also makes her Lost Lands debut.The remainder of the lineup is still to be seen, but these first few acts are very promising. Stay tune for more reveals, and the whole lineup soon enough!  lineupliquid strangerlost landsPeekabooslanderSpag HeddyWhipped CreamLover of all bass music.

"In the realm of all things possible, Will Smith coming out as a special guest for Jaden Smith’s set at Coachella isn’t particularly surprising. But, it’s still pretty damn cool.The Fresh Prince himself came out to perform “Icon” with his son at the Sahara stage on Friday. A longtime supporter of his son, not just his music endeavors, Will happily joined Jaden on stage to perform the track. Willow also reprised her appearance from weekend 1 and Jada looked on from the side.Weekend 2 of Coachella isn’t over yet, there’s plenty of fun still to be had and special guests to be seen.

"Woodstock’s 50th anniversary is set up to be absolutely legendary, with a stacked and diverse lineup. However, there’s also a fear setting in that this too-good-to-be-true event will flop.First red flag: The Black Keys dropped out.Second red flag: The official on sale has been pushed back to an undisclosed date.According to Billboard, booking agents were informed of the delay, which was set for April 22 — “There is currently a hold on the Woodstock 50 on-sale date.”Founder Michael Lang is casting out all rumors of a potential cancellation, even though 100,000 hopeful attendees are anxiously awaiting an opportunity to purchase. He has shrugged off the reports with confidence in saying they are merely “just rumors.”That slim reassurance is countered by an agent closely working with the production. The source says, “No one knows what the hell is going on but there is clearly a problem,”The holdup could potentially mean there’s a problem with investors or site complications with the venue itself — both of which could ultimately lead to the demise of Woodstock 50 event.As of now, the music festival is still on for August 16-18. There’s only a matter of months remaining to get this sorted out.Fingers crossed.Source: Billboard Woodstockwoodstock anniversarywoodstock cancellationwoodstock festivalChampion of the common folk and partaker of Old Toby,",articles6,['The Black Keys']
"WENZDAY just recently hit us with her  EP and we felt the passion behind the entire release. Now, we can see it — with a new video representation of the leading track of the same title.The song takes a provocative turn with this newly released official music video, as WENZDAY and friends live it up in a literal house of heartbreak. Neon fixtures and party vibes will draw you in, but there’s something unsettling about this “Heartbreak House.” Although, it’s visually stimulating at the same time. It gives off the feeling of falling for someone (or something) that you know very well isn’t good for you.Love can be an exciting and intriguing experience, even when it’s destined to end in heartbreak. WENZDAY’s EP encapsulates the stages of a breakup — from that point of no return to actually being broken up with — and all the hardships of an ending relationship. Even the ones that are doomed from the start.Watch “Heartbreak House” as it unfolds right here. Also, check out the  EP in full below.

"As soon as PhaseOne’s debut album  was announced in earlier this month, it was already one of the most anticipated albums of the year. Dropping the news on April Fool’s had fans wary that it was a joke, but sitting here now, 13 tracks and 43 minutes later after listening to this album, it’s safe to say this album is no joke at all.Plenty of artists have melded metal and bass already, the most salient among them being names like Sullivan King (who screams his own vocals and plays his own guitar, adding to the authenticity of his music) or Kayzo. But where PhaseOne differs from either of them is who he campaigned to appear on his album: Modestep, Thy Art Is Murder, Bone Thugs-N-Harmony, Northland, Periphery, Subtronics, and Koven.It’s not a far cry to call this the best bass album of the year so far. The competition in that category is slim, with only a few artists like Delta Heavy, Liquid Stranger, or LSDREAM releasing full-on bass albums in 2019. (Feed Me’s album falls in a gray area.) Between the hair-raising riddim anthems and the absolutely wild metal fusions on “Crash & Burn” or “Digital,”  is wildly entertaining and endlessly impressive. Plenty of the songs have applications for live special guests, while others, like “Demon Hunter” or “Break Em” are made to just melt faces.And by the time you get to “Lost” with Koven, when you think PhaseOne has covered all his bases, he introduces a bit of crazy drum n bass into the mix to truly round things out.I’ve actually had the album for a couple weeks, since we premiered “Crash & Burn” with Northlane earlier this month, and every person I’ve shown the album to in that time has had the same reaction: “Oh my god, what the f*ck is this.” The wide versatility and appeal of , despite its intensity and rather specific demographic, is what makes the album so good. For most of the bass community that either grew up on metal or emo, this album hits all the boxes and marks all the themes of what a truly transcendent bass album should be. is out now via Disciple — listen to it below. bass musiccrossoverdebut albumdiscipledrum n bassdubstepkovenmetal hybridModestepphaseoneTranscendencyLover of all bass music.

"Marshmello has collaborated with his fair share of hip hop artists, but how do his opinions match up to yours? In a new series called Rap Chats from the blog Cool Accidents, Marshmello voices off on his favorite MC, best rap producer, best rap group and more.For favorite MC, Marshmello goes for Roddy Ricch, with whom he made the song “Project Dreams” late last year — this one’s probably a promo answer. Best rap producer? Marshmello chooses Southside 808 Mafia — they belong to the same management company. Best rap group? He goes for $uicideboy$ — given the reasoning behind his other answers so far, are we to expect a collaboration between these two on Marshmello’s hip hop album?Finally, he’s supposed to assemble his “fantasy rap squad.” Given five slots, he goes with Roddy Ricch, Post Malone, Juice WRLD, Drake, and Meek Mill. Can’t say we agree, but to each their own…We’ll probably hear that hip hop album some time in 2019, so this should be a good litmus test for what to expect on it.

"When you reach the level of headliner, you start getting paid the big bucks. Festivals like EDC and Ultra reach the hundreds of thousands for headlining acts, but nothing approaches the level of Coachella.The Goldenvoice festival regularly brings in the biggest names in music for two weekends every year, and brings  of them. From BLACKPINK to Billie Eilish to Childish Gambino to Bassnectar to DJ Snake to Ariana Grande, this year’s Coachella must have had quite the price tag.That number is actually probably even more than you think because of how much the festival reportedly paid Grande to headline. According to , Grande was paid the mind boggling fee of $8 million to perform in her headlining slot. (We assume this is for both weekends, though NME doesn’t specify.)Grande, also the festival’s youngest-ever headliner, was added to the lineup just months before the event as Kanye dropped out. In 2017, reported that Kendrick Lamar, Radiohead, and Lady Gaga each received between three and four million for headlining, but Grande has received significantly more at a reported $8 million.Coachella returns to Indio again on Friday for another weekend of fun in the sun. NME 8 millionAriana GrandebookingcoachellafeefestivalPriceSouthern CaliforniaLover of all bass music.

The Bosnian-born Swedish DJ stole the hearts of many at last year’s Tomorrowland with his wild and crazy acrobatics and personality, but he also has the production chops to back it up.Out now on Skrillex’s OWSLA is Ganacci’s new single, “Horse.” And much like his real life stage personality, that sort of class clown attitude carries over into the track’s music video, as well. It’s pointless to try and even describe it because it’s so wildly nonsensical, but… there’s a goat, a tiger, a horse, old people, Salvatore, lots of back and forth motions, and… yeah.Salvatore also drives a dress show like a motorcycle.Salvatore will make his EDC Las Vegas debut this May along with two performances at Intrigue Nightclub at the Wynn Hotel, plus dozens of festivals in Europe this Summer. Watch the video below and get ready to share this with literally every single one of your friends. Rukes.com Horsesmusic videoOWSLASalvatore GanacciLover of all bass music.

Now, both major streaming services behind the popular documentaries about the event could be subpoenaed for their collection of behind-the-scenes footage that was used by Netflix and Hulu respectively.Gregory Messer, the trustee responsible for the Fyre Festival estate, said“In order to create the documentaries, both Hulu and Netflix used unique behind-the-scenes footage of the festival. Due to a lack of information, it is impossible for the Trustee to determine where the footage came from and whether such footage was an asset of the Debtor’s estate.”He’s seeking subpoenas for both Netflix and Hulu as part of a bankruptcy filing on behalf of his client.

"The scene lost something special when Beta Nightclub in Denver shut down earlier this year. However, the venue, known as one of the best in the country for bass music, is already planning its epic return. From the sounds of it — Beta 2.0 will be back and better than ever.In a recent interview club partner Mike McCray revealed the nature of the extensive renovations Beta is going through with. “We’re going to be using at least 260 LED screen panels throughout the main part of the venue here,” he shared. “Then we’ll have approximately 240-250 additional light fixtures in here, so it’s gonna be a pretty extensive rig.”Fellow partner Brad Roulier echoed, “The lighting system Mike has come up with, nobody has seen it before. It’s never been done, so he’s talking humbly and modestly about the LEDs and fixtures but nobody’s ever seen it before. He gave you the specs, but it’s how the specs are put together, and how it’s designed perfectly for the room.”The one-of-a-kind lighting installation could certainly give Beta 2.0 more of an edge on its competition in Denver, having shut down not long after Temple’s new club opening. The remodeling runs even deeper, including new furniture and interior design. Plans have been confirmed to move the upstairs DJ booth, and make space for a second room.Beta 2.0 also looks to introduce a daytime pool, which will set the venue apart from all others. Drawing in a new demographic, while remaining true to the longtime fans and loyal clubbers.“We were hanging onto our legacy instead of being at our core, which is club culture evolving. Beta will never be finished, and was always gonna be evolving, but I think the last few years the evolution had kind of stopped,” Roulier explained.No official date on the grand reopening, but we can expect it to happen sometime over summer 2019. EDM.com Beta 2.0beta nightclubnightlifepoolrenovationreopening",articles6,"['Drawing', '“We']"

It was immediately obvious they were gearing up for a massive release together, as the Mixmash Records team handed out paper megaphones with the text: This leaked onstage video reveals what we’ll call the “Oh Yes” ID — a revitalized version of the well-known party classic “Rocking With The Best,” which released early 2007. In the past, Luke has expressed his interest in reworking the track for the club and the radio, and it sounds like that time has finally come.Laidback Luke recently signed Keanu Silva to his record label. In recent months the rising producer has made big waves with his original “Fine Day” following the Don Diablo edit of his track “King Of My Castle.” Meanwhile, Luke has surprised with remixes for Calvin Harris’ “Giant” and Tiësto’s “Jackie Chan.” Needless to say, a collab of this nature between the two is almost inevitable.Back to the track, the “Oh Yes” ID is an instant party starter and the revival of a true classic. For now, this is some of the only proof we have that the song exists, as well as a play in Laidback Luke’s Mixmash Takeover (10:07). Keeping our fingers crossed for an official release soon!  Keanu Silvalaidback lukeLeakMiami Music Weekmixmash recordsOh YesRockin with the BestWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"With Ultra Music Festival behind us, and one weekend of Coachella counted down, we turn our attention to the next big music festival in the US, and certainly the biggest electronic music gathering in the entire country: EDC Las Vegas.The lineup for the annual festival dropped earlier this year with the usual Nightowl Radio broadcast — it was tough, but we worked hard to accurately represent all the artists on the lineup stage by stage.

Green Velvet Presents La La Land and Fisher will no doubt attract large crowds at neonGARDEN, while bassheads everywhere are salivating at the thought of witnessing Skream! B2B Rusko for an old skool dubstep set. Add to that The Glitch Mob, Black Tiger Sex Machine, Nero, Sub Focus B2B Wilkinson and more, and bassPOD is one of the most formidable stages of the weekend.wasteLAND brings hard dance to the desert with the likes of Lady Faith, Lil Texas, Tweekacore, MADGRRL, and more; on the other hand, quantumVALLEY goes for the feels with Aly & Fila, Infected Mushroom, Giuseppe Ottaviani Live 2.0, John O’Callaghan and more.stereoBLOOM rounds out the stage lineup, as hosted by Insomniac Music Group.

"With Beyoncé‘s show-stopping headline set at Coachella last year — Ariana Grande low key had a lot to live up to this weekend as reigning pop supreme. But, naturally, she didn’t disappoint.The star enlisted in ‘NSYNC to push her set over the edge, giving a nostalgic energy to her live performance that an older crowd could appreciate. Throwing it back to songs like “Tearin’ Up My Heart” and a magnificent “Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored” vs. “It Makes Me Ill” mashup, their on-stage chemistry breathed new life to ‘NSYNC’s hits.Nicki Minaj also showed up to perform a couple of tracks, “Side to Side” and “Bang Bang.” She also brought out hip hop legends Diddy and Mase. Let’s be real, Grande and her immaculate voice could have carried the entire show on their own — but Coachella is so much better with special guests. The more the better.At one point, Grande got on the mic to proclaim: “I’ve been practicing my whole life for this moment! I could die now.” Ok, please don’t before next weekend.

"A new wristband that detects the “date rape” drug is now available in Germany.This is Xantus, a new tester bracelet and secret weapon for potential victims. It was invented by a student, Kim Eisenmann, after her friend fell was assaulted — and she’s determined to help put a stop to “date rape.”The recyclable wristband offers three main functions. Preventative protection, because offenders will be deterred from slipping something in your drink if you’re wearing it. It’s a reminder, because every time you take a glance down, it will remind you to be careful and aware. Finally, it actually detects the most common “date rape” drug, GHB.

"Knife Party’s Knifecast Podcast remains pretty underground except for the duo’s devoted following which catches it every episode; but for those who do listen, they always end up getting something like a new track or some bit of “insider” info that no one else gets.On the latest episode, Knifecast 13, Knife Party debuted a new single entitled “Ghost Train.” You’ll remember that Knife Party shared a track called “Ghost Town” last November on Knifecast, but it doesn’t sound like the two are sonically related at all.“Ghost Town” is a pulsing, pounding tune that borders on techno and house, with Knife Party’s typical horror-infused melody laced throughout.Could we hear this on Knife Party’s forthcoming EP, which the duo revealed was finished in their February podcast?

We’re absolutely loving this story she just told about the time she “met” Kanye West at Coachella. Well, almost.As the story goes, Alison was chilling backstage after playing at the iconic music festival for the first time ever. This was back in 2015 and Kanye just so happened to be there as well. Only it was a surprise — so she couldn’t have known that ahead of time.After her set, the producer ate some mushrooms and thought she saw the one and only Yeezy, one of her musical idols. She shrugged it off, thinking her mind was playing tricks on her. Anyone who has done shrooms understands this lapse in judgement that can be experienced.Anyways, it ended up being him — Kanye West walked onto the stage just moments later. Alison had her “aha” moment.In honor of Coachella, here’s the wonderful story of how Alison and Kanye both brushed shoulders with greatness. Now — collab, please?In 2015 at Coachella after my set I did 🍄 and I thought i saw kanye standing next to me.

He came out on the main stage with Khalid for their collaboration “Silence,” holding a microphone which ironically never got used.For CHVRCHES, he came out on stage with a guitar, à la their joint appearance on Jimmy Kimmel, for their song “Here With Me.” Videos from the festival are still in the process of being shared as more people regain service leaving the polo fields, but check out some highlights below.literally no one:you: pic.twitter.com/TaqbAtlIWJ— angie (@seavmendes) April 15, 2019.@thegreatkhalid brought out @marshmellomusic last night and killed it. #Coachella19 #weekend1 #marshmello #Khalid #music pic.twitter.com/ITZE6a3Shb— Robby Cruz (@RConAir_967) April 15, 2019Falling in deep @CHVRCHES @marshmellomusic pic.twitter.com/jKyzNhxBSa— Coachella (@coachella) April 15, 2019. @coachella weekend one: done 🌵🔥 pic.twitter.com/DNso7W9JdP— CHVRCHΞS (@CHVRCHES) April 15, 2019You just had to know when @marshmellomusic dropped by @thegreatkhalid set he was gonna make an appearance @CHVRCHES set. #Coachella19 #music #chvrches #marshmello pic.twitter.com/WzamyCxHPB— Robby Cruz (@RConAir_967) April 15, 2019  CHVRCHEScoachellahere with mekhalidmarshmellosilenceSpecial GuestLover of all bass music.

"This evening in Paris, roughly 10:30am PDT, the Notre Dame caught on fire and caused significant damage to the structure, including destroying its iconic spire. Social media was quickly populated with images and videos, including live coverage from news stations around the globe.The main structure broke ground in the 12th century and was completed in the 1300s, though parts of it continued to be renovated over the years. It was actually in the middle of a renovation project, which is believed to be involved in the cause of the fire. This is the first major destructive incident to occur to the structure in some time, and it is truly, absolutely heartbreaking.Plenty of the world’s most famous DJs hail from France, including DJ Snake, David Guetta, and Daft Punk.

"Gesaffelstein dropped his new album  earlier this year amidst many mixed reactions. Even here at Your EDM, we weren’t really sure what to make of the pop-infused techno and forward-thinking release. Even more so, we were worried that kind of indecision would bleed into his return to live shows at Coachella this weekend.Thankfully, that was 1000% not the case.The prince of darkness took the stage at the Outdoor Theater at 7:45pm on Sunday and proceeded to lay down a torrent of techno and dark beats upon the unsuspecting crowd. The Coachella kids who probably first learned of him because he put out a song with The Weeknd or HAIM were surely struck by the persistent beats and minimalist production.Those of us who’ve known Gesaffelstein, however, more than welcomed his return to form. Sporting a new outfit and missing his usual chainsmoking, Gesaffelstein transported the crowd into another dimension over the course of an hour.Listen to the set below while you can — Coachella is taking them down quick.  coachellagesaffelsteinHyperionlive setoutdoor theaterReturnweekend oneLover of all bass music.

"Swedish House Mafia have announced a special exhibition of photography and film as part of their work with artist Alexander Wessely, following a teaser yesterday., opening at Stockholm’s centre for contemporary photography, Fotografiska, on April 30 – May 5, chronicles the trio’s journey of their “death to rebirth.” In other words, from their One Last Tour show at Ultra in 2013 to their reunion at Ultra in 2018. The exhibition opens ahead of the group’s sold out, back to back homecoming shows at the Tele2 Arena in Stockholm over May 2, 3, and 4.“Alexander has been able to follow our journey like no one else could. He sees, hears and interprets everything that we do, visually. His incredibly strong aesthetics are very near to our hearts and mirrors the journey of life almost perfectly” says Steve Angello, Sebastian Ingrosso and Axwell.In , Wessely presents the trio through his unique spectrum where the dark, the bizarre, and the graceful meet. Purgatorium – the process of going through a tough, cleansing period filled with suffering that ultimately leads to development – is a true representation of where Swedish House Mafia find themselves at present.“It has been a thoroughly organic and almost obvious process from the start. For me, Swedish House Mafia is about so much more than just three musicians. They are the definition of a cultural wave and have always explored ways to stretch the limits of what is possible. To be able to present this exhibition together with them at Fotografiska means so much” tells Alexander Wessely.Buy tickets here.

"The first night of Coachella has come and gone, and with it a lot of memorable moments. For those who chose to migrate to the main stage, they witnessed Childish Gambino throw down a set for the ages. For those who stayed at Sahara for Kayzo’s Unleashed show, they probably went back to their homes or tents with bruised necks. For those who decided to witness DJ Snake at the Outdoor Theater, they witnessed the first-ever live performance of “Taki Taki” with Selena Gomez, Cardi B, and Ozuna all on the same stage.Snake’s roughly 75-minute set contained all of his biggest hits like “Propaganda” and “Turn Down For What” (but no “Get Low”?) and the crowd was absolutely loving the bass in the desert. But, of course, Snake saved the best for last when he welcomed not just Selena Gomez, not just Cardi B, not just Ozuna, but ALL THREE on stage for the first-ever live performance of “Taki Taki.”It was a banner moment for any set, but one that will definitely mark a highlight for W1 attendees — he likely won’t pull the same surprise next weekend.

"There are those remixes that exist simply as remixes. Then, there are the remixes that totally redefine a song for a new audience, bringing a fresh perspective to the listener.Anyone who watched Flume throw down at Coachella 2014 experienced that second kind of remix firsthand. It was the debut of one of his finest remixes to date. Arguably, one of the best remixes of any song ever.Of course, we’re talking about Lorde‘s “Tennis Court” (Flume Remix). The producer sent shockwaves through the entire crowd when he dropped his remix of the massive hit song for the first time. And, by the time the drop hit on the “Oh” — the crowd was drowning out the track with “Ohs” of its own.Relive the electrifying moment below. The footage isn’t the best visually, but you can hear the “Tennis Court” remix play out loud and clear — that’s what counts.P.S.

"Weekend one of Coachella is heating up… quite literally.A fire reportedly broke out early Saturday morning at the music festival in Indio, California around 2:06 am local time. The video below clearly shows the flames and black smoke rising out of a trailer.The Coachella fire occurred near the center of the Empire Polo Club grounds venue, at a mobile shower unit. The blaze completely destroyed one trailer in the process and damaged another. It’s not clear exactly what caused the explosion.According to the Riverside County Fire Department, four engines responded to the scene.Thankfully, no injuries were reported.Just days before Coachella took place, a worker tragically died in the staging area.

"Coachella has finally arrived for some very lucky desert dwellers this weekend. And, there’s always Couchella for those of us streaming at home.With any great lineup, comes great conflicts. For us, one of the biggest overlaps of the entire weekend comes right now as DJ Snake and Kayzo are set to hit different stages. DJ Snake, being the festival pro that he is, never disappoints. On the other hand, Kayzo is about to throw down an absolutely gnarly closing set himself with some special guests expected to show up and take it to the next level.The rest of today’s stream has proven to be insanely stacked. All night long, fans have feasted their eyes and ears on live sets from Jauz, JPEGMAFIA, SG Lewis, Gorgon City, Polo & Pan, BLACKPINK, Rüfüs Du Sol, and headliner Childish Gambino.

Rather than sulking in the fomo, it’s time to get caught up on day one so we can enjoy another round of amazing music today.It’s impossible to pick favorites here, but Kayzo, DJ Snake, and Diplo were most definitely among our favorite performances of Coachella 2019 (thus far). Jauz brought the energy early in the day, serving up a high energy, rave-worthy set — one of yesterday’s true highlights.Plus, Rüfüs Du Sol, Gorgon City, Nora En Pure and Nina Kraviz (live) all performed.Relive some of the best sets from yesterday and gear up for day two!  Coachella 2019diplodj snakegorgon cityjauzkayzolive setsnina kraviznora en purerufus du solLover of all bass music.

"Last year, Jauz vowed to remix the viral children’s song “Baby Shark” if he received 20,000 retweets. Yesterday at Coachella, he finally revealed the remix in all its glory and it’s already one of our favorite Coachella moments ever.It’s not a particularly complex remix, and it bears a lot of resemblance to his material from , but it’s also easily one of the catchiest remixes we’ve heard if only because it samples “Baby Shark.” Though we were surprised to hear it so early in his set, only about 10 tracks in, we were excited to hear it nonetheless.Here it is, @Jauzofficial's ""Baby Shark"" remix in all its glory 😂👶🦈 if you aren't watching the @Coachella live stream, you missed it! https://t.co/pDZWjRL1V3 pic.twitter.com/Zhs8PcSP5x— Your EDM (@YourEDM) April 13, 2019Jauz kept things going by editing the “do do do” from “Baby Shark” into the melody from “Sandstorm,” and from there the party got even better.

"One of the coolest moments of any Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike set is when they drop “Crowd Control” and everyone in the crowd moves as one.

Before DVLM went on for their own set just a little while after, they came out on stage and performed “Crowd Control” to the absolutely massive crowd you see in the video below — around 100,000 people says Dimitri.From the video below, it looks like an absolutely crazy moment to be a part of!  100000 peoplebrazilCrowd Controldimitri vegaslike mikelollapaloozatwenty one pilotsLover of all bass music.

As seen played out in the behind-the-scenes documentary snapshot,Avicii: True StoriesBut, there’s more.Now, we have a glimpse into the making of “SOS” as told by the late star’s co-songwriters and co-producers Kristoffer Fogelmark and Albin Nedler, who previously worked with him on “Pure Grinding.” Also, Aloe Blacc, the voice of “SOS,” “Wake Me Up,” and other unreleased Avicii works.To hear these talented individuals speak so highly of Avicii comes as no surprise. However, it does bring another dimension to the artist’s first posthumous release, “SOS.” These guys have been working on the song since the beginning.

"Galantis have only a handful of remixes to their name, but the ones they do have are all absolute anthems: Selena Gomez’ “Fetish,” Sam Smith’s “Too Good At Goodbyes,” Ed Sheeran’s “Shape Of You,” etc. Now, the Swedish duo takes on Norway with a flip of Kygo’s “Think About You” feat. Valerie Broussard.“Think About You” is Kygo’s first original of 2019, released on Valentine’s Day. The original once again showed off Kygo’s penchant for beautiful piano melodies, but Galantis’ reimagined remix puts their flavor front and center. The piano has a housier feel and the synths are brighter and more energetic. All in all, it’s a brilliant remix that could only come from a combiantion like Galantis and Kygo.Check it out below and get ready to hear this at festivals all year long! Rukes.com GalantishouseKygoremixthink about youLover of all bass music.

"Running a successful music festival is probably one of the hardest jobs there is. Between coordinating all the moving pieces from talent buying to staff to security to ticketing and more, there are so many things that could go wrong that for everything to go right is incredible. For seven years, Paradiso Music Festival in Washington has been doing things right, and now in its eighth year, it continues to grow and outperform years past.In fact, now in its 8th year, it is selling the fastest it ever has before and will more than likely completely sell out well over a month in advance. This year’s festival features world-class names like Skrillex, Kaskade, What So Not, Alison Wonderland, Illenium, and more. With support from 1788-L, Gammer, Getter, Shiba San, Phantoms, Goldfish, and more, there’s really something for everyone.Paradiso is also one of the very few Gorge music festivals that has persisted for so many years. Recently, Sasquatch, End of the Rainbow, and What The Fest have all either dissolved completely or postponed their 2019 events. Such resilience proves that Paradiso is one of those festivals absolutely worth going to.Tickets to Paradiso are still available, but not for long!

"Shipfam are wondering: what’s going on?Typically, Holy Ship! announces dates soon after each year’s sailing, but this year, the dates are conspicuously late. With each passing day, more and more Shipfam are asking what’s happening. And usually, a late announce isn’t a nail in any proverbial coffin, but a separate tweet from Friendship raises suspicions that Holy Ship! 2020 won’t move forward.Additionally, Friendship has moved its dates to 1/6-1/10 in 2020, which raises even further suspicion that Holy Ship! won’t be returning as it generally sails around those dates, as well.FriendShip is the only Ship : https://t.co/uzwTeFlYCH #2020— FRIENDSHIP 2020 (@Friendship) April 11, 2019We’ve reached out to Insomniac for comment and will update with their response.

"With every new single, LSD has turned heads and boosted imaginations everywhere. The dynamic supergroup, consisting of powerhouse artists Labrinth, Sia and Diplo, has dazzled at every opportunity thus far. Finally, we get to hear their full collection of work — and it does not disappoint. now runs 10 total, utterly magical tracks deep. It doesn’t translate directly into the EDM realm, but instead creates its own vast melting pot of genres. With influences of rock, pop, dance, and everything in between, LSD find their own unprecedented sound that embraces their individual musical quirks as they each march to the beat of their own drum.There is no sacrifice made here, no making room for the others to shine. Instead, Labrinth, Sia, and Diplo go all out. Labrinth delivers his smooth lines, Sia belts out her instinctive lyrics and Diplo builds up the beat to the max. At any given moment, there’s a lot going on. Notes or tones or weird moments that should sound a little “off” are entirely on, if that makes sense. This is raw artistry at its finest.With these three, nothing is off limits, which creates an inspiring, anything-is-possible aura that surrounds the release. Every song is a trip and the full album is comparable to the pot of gold that awaits at the end of a rainbow. Bursting with color and creativity, bold lyrics, and stellar production, LSD is a knockout in every sense.Perhaps you’ve already fallen in love with the sound of LSD, through “Audio,” “Genius,” “Thunderclouds” or “No New Friends.” Now, it’s time to dive deeper.

"It’s been almost two weeks since Ultra Music Festival ended, marking its first time at Virginia Key this year. The event wasn’t without its challenges, which was to be expected after only having four months to prepare. Transportation issues the first day, as well as a small fire, contributed to a flood of negative comments on social media; however, the festival ended on a positive note.Now, the Miami City Council must vote on whether it gets another year on Virginia Key. When the current contract was approved by a 4-1 vote last November, it included a revocable option within 60 days after the festival given special circumstances.The City Council included a discussion on Ultra in its agenda for the meeting today, which Miami Herald reporter Joey Flechas attended — Flechas has been instrumental in sharing Ultra news from the meetings, including the vote last year. Over the course of the meeting, Key Biscayne Mayor Mike Davey appeared to oppose the festival returning in 2020. Davey created a defamatory video before the issue went to vote last year, which Ultra called “blatantly disreputable.”Commissioner Joe Carollo, who was the sole nay vote last November, continued to voice his opposition to the festival. “Carollo makes it clear, if it isn’t already: He will oppose bringing Ultra back to Virginia Key,” tweeted Flechas during the meeting.City Manager Emilio Gonzalez and Commissioner Keon Hardemon voiced their support for the festival, recognizing the monumental task they were given with only months to prepare. Flechas tweeted, “Hardemon said Ultra was given lemons & they made lemonade.”Ultra is now in the 2-month period where the city has to decide if it wants keep festival on the island. Flechas says that a vote is scheduled for May 9, 21 days before the 2-month period ends.Now Key Biscayne Mayor Mike Davey speaking to oppose Ultra Music Festival's presence on Virginia Key. Ultra is in the 2-month period where city has to decide if it wants keep festival on island.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Carollo has a discussion item on Ultra later today. Suarez says he got emails from Key residents and Miami residents complaining about Ultra. Thanks Davey for his perspective, and indicates he wants adjustments before festival can come back.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Suarez was very supportive of Ultra’s move to Virginia Key, told press 2 days before festival that Virginia Key was right location for festival. After first night logistical problems & noise complaints from residents, he’s shifted— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Now he has specific changes he wants festival to make before coming back, including turning down the bass, improving the transportation plan, more use of water taxis,— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019In his mayor’s message, Suarez is now outlining some of his recommendations if city wants to keep Ultra on Vga Key. Wants city to set a standard for lo-frequency bass so that it cannot be heard from the mainland. Wants to consider moving back festival closing time— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Also wants Ultra to not use to Vizcaya as a drop-off point. Recommends Government Center as an alternative.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019A stream of citizens have asked commissioners to not let Ultra come back or at least consider waiting to make a decision until after environmentalists have a better sense of the impact on Virginia Key’s sensitive environment— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Significant opposition to Ultra’s return to the island in public comment. The discussion will be held later this afternoon. Commission broke for lunch, will come back at 3 p.m.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Now, onto Ultra Music Festival. #ultra— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Commissioner Joe Carollo has opened a discussion item to discuss impacts of festival. A police officer reports numbers we already know — 37 arrests, mostly for trespassing. Notes that one person jumped from bridge to try to swim around and sneak into festival.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Carollo seems to be disappointed with Ultra’s performance. Says Key Biscayne residents’ concerns should not be dismissed. The complaints about loud music from mainland residents were not surprising, he said.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Commission Manolo Reyes says he expected there to be hiccups, particularly in the first year. Jokes that he and Willy Gort used to jump from the Powell bridge to swim in the bay for fun— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019City Manager Emilio Gonzalez emphasizes that understanding first-year hiccups, he believe the festival operations can be tweaked to deal with logistical problems — using more water vessels, ending event earlier in the night, and readjusting bus shuttle system.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Hardemon opens his comments by thanking city staff and Ultra for coordinating what he considers to be a “marvelous” operation.”Whatever narrative has been put in the media, this was a tremendously successful event.”— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Hardemon said Ultra was given lemons & they made lemonade. Which, when you consider history here, is true. Ultra spent months hashing out a contract w/Carollo last year, only to have Carollo reject that contract in September, sparking a unanimous rejection.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Then they faced a make-or-break vote in November for a Virginia Key venue, a brand new venue for a huge production. Less time to plan, they needed to take what they could get bc they had sold tickets. Even angry Key Biscayners say organizers did the best they could— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019The main objection from folks, across the board, is that Virginia Key is simply not an appropriate venue bc it has one causeway in and out, sound carries over water to agitate mainland residents, and the environment/wildlife is sensitive and prone to negative impact— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Reality is that Ultra faced some serious logistical challenges, transit plans were untested bc an event of that size was unprecedented on Vga Key, and sound inconvenience was unknown (with specificity, who would hear it and where) until after the event happened.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Facing those challenges, night 1 was a mess for people leaving who expected more order and a speedier exit, and the next few nights were markedly better.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Russell is clearly focused on the point that the main stage faced west, toward Miami. Residents from the Roads, Brickell, Grove, and even as far as Edgewater could hear the bass.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Carollo is now reading emails he received from residents who complained about hearing Ultra’s bass. One by one, he’s reading multiple emails into the record. People complaining of windows rattling and flashing lights at night.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019I got a lot of emails and even some texts from people I know like this, too. Residents, ranging from angry to a little annoyed, with the bass carrying over the mainland, with lines of festivalgoers at the Vizcaya pick-up/drop-off point, with the lights,— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019On the other hand, I also interviewed a lot of people who (apart from the logistics) had a great time, enjoyed themselves, filled hotel rooms and ate at local restaurants. Like with any big event that has an international audience, there’s a economic value to Ultra— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019At the same time, the environmental impact has not been fully understood, according to environmental activists, Were research animals affected? Or birds?— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Carollo stopped his reading, noting that his point is that he got emails from a wide stretch across Miami, at different times (some in the early morning form exasperated citizens).— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019Carollo makes it clear, if it isn’t already: He will oppose bringing Ultra back to Virginia Key. So that’s one “no.” It would take three no votes to oust Ultra from the island.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019So regarding Ultra, the showdown is set for May 9. Commissioners want more time, they want to notice this vote to all interested parties, and get all proponents and opponents to comment and then decided if Ultra gets another year on Virginia Key.— Joey Flechas (@joeflech) April 11, 2019 city of miamicommissionCouncilFutureultraultra music festivalvoteLover of all bass music.

"Police just seized the largest amount of ecstasy in Finnish history — in a single bust.Approximately 152,000 tablets of the substance were confiscated from an apartment in Lahti. The breakdown: 151,390 ecstasy tablets, 1,095 Subutex 8 mg tablets and 211.7 grams of amphetamine. All this according to an official police announcement made on Thursday.The effort by National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and local police reportedly saw through the arrest of a 30-year-old man, who remains in custody for an aggravated narcotics offense, pending trial. Another lesser involved, 35-year-old man was apprehended and released, but remains under travel ban. One other was questioned for drug smuggling and remains in custody.The suspicious activity occurred as police monitored a truck registered in Lithuania, which was spotted driving to a Merrasjärvi public beach parking lot. Another vehicle with a Finnish registration arrived shortly after and the men began moving the cargo to the smaller car. Then, they relocated to an apartment.Finnish police stepped in and seized more than half the amount of ecstasy confiscated throughout all of 2018. The bust was worth an estimated 2.3 million euros, street value. yle ArrestDrug BustecstasyFinlandFinnishpoliceWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Marshmello announced earlier this week he had a new release with SOB X RBE coming out today, but little did anyone know that they were dropping a full EP! The new release  has three tracks between the two artists, “Roll The Dice,” “Don’t Save Me,” and “First Place.”Much like Marshmello’s other hip hop productions with Roddy Ricch or Migos, the “typical” Marshmello sound gets entirely lost in the glitz of the beat. You’d never know he was involved going into these tracks blind. That being said, the production is solid and clean, and stands up to muster when compared to Mello’s other tracks.It’s also rather curious how Marshmello would conflate this curse-heavy music into his more child-friendly persona. A lot of parents let their kids listen to Marshmello because his music is relatively easy listening and has some pretty cute beats, but  is entirely at odds with that image.Regardless,  is here and you can listen to it below, out now via his own Joytime Collective imprint. Rukes.com collaborationHip Hopmarshmelloproductionroll the dicesob x rbeLover of all bass music.

"Ultra Miami 2019 saw a lot of changes and challenges. Now, it’s time to assess for 2020. The City of Miami is scheduled to meet tomorrow and one thing on the agenda is the return (or not) of the signature music festival next year.It’s obvious that Ultra is fighting for its new home at Virginia Key Beach Park and Miami Marine Stadium. Two important operational factors — transportation and noise mitigation — are the main topics of discussion, per the preliminary recap. If Ultra can demonstrate improvement in these areas, there’s a much better chance for the festival to stay put for next year and years to come.The report is rather straightforward: “The City is confident that, when the event returns to Virginia Key next year, additional operational enhancements and resources can be implemented to further improve transportation and noise mitigation.”Over the weekend, Ultra Miami 2019 was hit with 36 noise compliance and 13 disturbance calls.Meanwhile, a total of 37 people were arrested. 281 EMT calls were responded to onsite.More on all this following the city council meeting tomorrow. Rukes.com improvementmiaminoise complainttransportationultravirginia keyWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"One of the people who taught Martin Garrix how to produce music seeks to educate the next generation of producers. Mark Otten is set to teach class at STMPD Studios in Amsterdam.When it comes to learning music production, there are endless options out there. Online courses, full-on academies, tutorials and the always trusty YouTube. But, does anything beat sitting down face-to-face with the one of the people behind the #1 DJ in the world?In addition to coaching Garrix during his time at the Herman Brood Academie (where he attended for four years), this guy has worked with Julian Jordan, Firebeatz, De Sluwe Vos, We Are Loud, Maduk, Pythius and more. Otten has his own thoughts about the current generation of producers, which he refers to as “rule collectors.”“… most of them seem to have a strategy of gathering enough rules for music production in order to obtain great tracks,” Otten explains. “I however believe this strategy only works to a certain extent, it doesn’t always get you to the level you want and has a tendency of removing spontaneity and personal creativity.”Prices start at €250 for a two-hour introductory session for those under 21 — otherwise it’s €300. Another option offers 10 hours of one-on-one coaching over five sessions at €1,250 and €1,500, for U21 and 21+ respectively.Learn more here. Music RadarRukes.com classcoachingcourseMark OttenMartin GarrixMusic ProductionSTMPD StudiosWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"It has already been determined that 2019 is the year of Swedish House Mafia — and apparently they have yet another huge festival booking yet to announce. The trio is expected at Tomorrowland this year, according to inside sources.Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello will reportedly unite this summer as the iconic music festival celebrates 15 years. Nothing has been set in stone — at least not publicly — but a much anticipated finale to close out the festival over weekend two sounds about right. A representative for Tomorrowland could not confirm nor deny the report to Your EDM.An ever-so-subtle, maybe intentional, maybe not, hint in a Tomorrowland teaser put fans into a frenzy earlier this year. Though that teaser was eventually determined to be for Tomorrowland’s radio station. Again, it looks like Swedish House Mafia will do everything in their power to ensure this installment is one for the books.Tomorrowland takes place over two weekends, July 19 – 21 and 26 – 28. Keep your eyes and ears peeled for an official announcement. Unless, perhaps Tomorrowland wants to keep this a “surprise.”We are all one. pic.twitter.com/hCocGfyfFK— Tomorrowland (@tomorrowland) February 9, 2019 We Rave YouRukes.com headlinerMusic FestivalReportrumorswedish house mafiatomorrowlandWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Just this week Avicii‘s first posthumous track was released… “SOS” with Aloe Blacc, the same collaborator from the producer’s famous hit “Wake Me Up.” It’s a little eerie this music comes after his death, but it’s also amazing to hear where Avicii’s head was at.As his longtime collaborator suggests, there’s even more to come. Before Avicii passed away, he and Aloe worked on a number of tracks together. They were more than just collaborators, but friends. “SOS” and hopefully even more of their work will be featured on the forthcoming album .“It was a special moment for me,” Blacc shares in a short audio clip via C89.5. “I had the opportunity to go into the studio with [Avicii] and work on several songs that haven’t come out. Some are just as big as ‘Wake Me Up.'”For now, enjoy “SOS” and let us know what you think… C89.5 aloe blaccaviciicollabcollaborationSOStimWake Me UpWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"DJs take a lot of criticism. Unfortunately, it just comes with the territory. Even pros like Kaskade can’t please everyone, every set. But, let’s take a quick moment to applaud the way he handled the following tweet, shall we?The conversation started when a fan voiced their concern following Kaskade’s Phoenix Lights performance over the weekend. Apparently it sounded like he just “threw bs together,” at least in this person’s opinion. Kaskade could have easily grazed over the tweet and ignored, but he spoke up instead.Kaskade’s Redux concept is quite different than his traditional sets. It celebrates his roots, the music he listened to coming up. To hear a Redux set is to better understand Kaskade as an artist.But here’s the kicker…Ah, Kaskade put him down gently with a little sarcasm and carried on. He stood by his work, knowing that many would love it — and some might hate it. Moral of the story: true fans will stick by an artist no matter what.This set seemed to anger some people AND make others very happy. I admit I went well into the redux zone on the main stage… sometimes I just can’t help myself. redux was never meant for the masses. I hope by writing this tweet your day has been made brighter and a weight lifted https://t.co/6oBpn4GgdP— Kaskade (@kaskade) April 8, 2019“Your set sucked!”

It is an acquired taste.
However, I totally respect the man for changing it up at a festival versus just catering to the occasion.

"DJ Mag might be most well known for its Top 100 DJs ranking every year, but it also hones in on North America every year in its Best Of North America poll. With the region driving so much traffic and interest in dance music across the world every year, a poll focusing on North America is only logical.Sixteen categories are presented, from Best DJ to Best Live Act to Best Label and all the other accolades that come in between. Some notable entries are Marc Rebillet for Best Live Act and 1788-L’s remix of “Disintegrate Slowly” by The Glitch Mob for Best Remix/Edit.Notable exclusions include not a single Las Vegas club in either Club category, as well as the omission of both Electric Daisy Carnival and Ultra Music Festival from Best Festival.Voting for the poll opened this morning, and ends on April 23; results will be announced on May 28.Go HERE to vote, and see the full list of nominations below.Robert Hood

"For those not traveling to Indio this year, you can still enjoy Coachella from the comfort of your own home with the live stream as always. This year, both weekends will be streamed live, with the usual content you’re used to seeing on Weekend 1 and a “Coachella Curated” stream on Weekend 2 with “days of original content, full Yuma Tent sets, performances, and more.”As we get ready for this weekend, whether preparing snacks on the couch or packing up the car, Coachella is revealing all the artists who you can catch on the live stream. Forty-eight artists have been named so far, with a little over 25% of them being dance music artists.A R I Z O N A | Bob Moses | Clozee | Dillon Francis

"Skrillex isn’t one to stay still for any length of time. Having just wrapped up a hectic schedule in Miami just a couple weeks ago, he’s back on the studio grind, and this time it’s with up-and-coming rapper SAINt JHN.While “up-and-coming” might not accurately describe every artist with nearly 2 million monthly Spotify listeners, SAINt JHN only released his debut album in 2019 and is still in the process of turning heads.Going through his 2018 mixtape , it seems ripe for a Skrillex collaboration… or six.SAINt JHN played HARD Summer in 2016 and also played KAOS Nightclub the same night as Skrillex this past weekend, so his relation to dance music and Skrillex aren’t in question. We’re excited to hear what comes of these tracks, whenever they might be released.I just made like 6 songs with @Skrillex maybe 6 and a half 🤷🏾‍♂️— S A I N t J H N (@SAINtJHN) April 6, 2019 Hip Hopnew collabsrappersaint jhnsix songsskrillexstudioUp and comingLover of all bass music.

"Ultra Music Festival faced many challenges in 2019, not least of all the truncated preparation period afforded to them by being ousted from their Bayfront Park venue. The move to Virginia Key was approved in November 2018, giving the festival only four months to effectively plan and execute a festival for 50,000 people with loads of environmental red tape. It’s a miracle it happened at all, and speaks to the professionalism of the team at Ultra.But not all that glitters is gold, and the festival must still defend its position at Virginia Key for the years to come. On April 7, the week after the festival, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said, “I think putting 50,000 people in Virginia Key is not a good idea. There’s only one way in and one way out. I think they need to find a better place for it.”A meeting with Mayor Francis Suarez, City Manager Emilio Gonzalez and other admins was expected to review “what worked and what didn’t during the 3-day event,” which is now scheduled for this Thursday.On the meeting’s agenda, it simply says “a discussion regarding Ultra,” which is sponsored by Commissioner Joe Carollo. If you’ll recall, Carollo was the main opponent of the festival in the hearing last November; whether his thoughts have changed or not as a result of this year’s event is an unknown but important factor in this Thursday’s meeting.Miami Herald reporter Joey Flechas will more than likely be there tweeting live from the meeting — follow him and Your EDM to stay up to date. EDM Tunes city commissioncity of miamifestivalFuturemayormeetingmiamiultravirginia keyLover of all bass music.

"Make no mistake, Marshmello is a production machine. We’re only four months into 2019 and he’s getting ready to drop his fourth single of the year this Friday. (Spotify labels “Project Dreams” as a 2019 release, but it officially came out December 2018.) “Roll The Dice” with SOBxRBE is out in 3 days.As with most of Marshmello’s recent releases, there’s been no teaser for this one and we have no idea what it will sound like. Contrary to many DJs, Marshmello rarely plays out his own IDs during sets.SOBxRBE, the collective comprised of Slimmy b, Yhung T.O., Lul G, and Daboii, apparently gained early comparisons to N.W.A. due to their age and intensity. They’re hit “Paramedic!” on the Black Panther soundtrack has nearly 100 million streams.Marshmello is no stranger to rap, having already collaborated with Migos and Roddy Ricch (and a rumored forthcoming collab with Cardi B), and “Roll The Dice” should only serve to add to his repertoire of hits.Check out the track art below and check back on Friday to listen to the new tune!Friday 🔥 @SOBxRBE #mellomadeitright pic.twitter.com/Augtc0w0BA— marshmello (@marshmellomusic) April 9, 2019 Rukes.com collaborationCollectivefridayHip HopmarshmelloRapreleasesobxrbeLover of all bass music.

"While we’re already excited to catch RÜFÜS DU SOL on the Outdoor stage of Coachella on April 12 and 19, early arrivals will be able to catch a special event from the trio before the gates even open. In a press release sent to media yesterday, it was revealed that the band will unveil a sort film called “” named after the fan-favorite track from their 2018 album . Directed by James Frost, the film will be shown inside HP Inc.’s 11,000 square foot Antarctic Projection Dome during an exclusive VIP event on Thursday, April 11, the evening before the official opening of this year’s festival.During the special event, RÜFÜS DU SOL will also play a DJ set and participate in a panel discussion examining technology’s power to transform and humanize music by enhancing connections, collaboration and creativity. Starting on the same day, RÜFÜS DU SOL will become YouTube’s “Artist On The Rise” as well.Fans will still be able to experience the 360-degree film within the Antarctic Dome once the festival launches, as well.Frost, the mastermind behind music videos like Radiohead’s “House of Cards” and OK Go’s “This Too Shall Pass,” said, “RÜFÜS DU SOL and I have been trying to collaborate for a while, so when the opportunity arose to create the visual accompaniment to ‘Underwater’ for the HP Antarctic Dome at Coachella, I couldn’t think of a more perfect song and I knew we could create something magical. ‘Underwater’ is rich with layers, and the piece we’ve created immerses the audience visually and sonically in this expansive dome setting. I’m honored and thrilled not only to be asked to work on this, but also to have brought the piece to life with amazing graphic artists from around the world.”See a preview of the video below. 360 videoAntarctic Domecoachellahp/intelrufus du solshort filmunderwaterLover of all bass music.

"We’re still waiting on the official lineup for Lost Lands to drop, but Excision just revealed one of his headlining performances at the festival and it’s a biggie. While in past years he’s done his Detox set or a b2b with Downlink, this year he’ll be going B2B with none other than Illenium.And that’s not all — fans will be able to see the B2B earlier in the year at Global Dance Festival in Colorado this July, as well.Clearly Excision and Illenium have something special planned for these performances, and we certainly hope it’s more than just a back and forth between their two styles. Thankfully, both artists, Excision especially, have a lot of experience behind the decks and we have faith that they’ll deliver more than we expect.The rest of the lineup for Global Dance is getting dropped today, and hopefully Lost Lands won’t be too much later! In the meantime, check flights and hotels now because if this headliner pair is any indication, Global Dance Fest has a wild lineup coming.So stoked to be doing TWO back to back sets with @ILLENIUMMUSIC this summer, Global Dance and Lost Lands are going to be insane!! pic.twitter.com/Wb05xMkIeg— Excision (@Excision) April 10, 2019 Rukes.com announcementb2bexcisionfestivalglobal dance festILLENIUMlost landsLover of all bass music.

"It’s been over a year since Datsik was accused of multiple instances of sexual misconduct and abuse. The public backlash forced him to cancel his tour and he was swiftly dropped by his management, label and booking agency. His career virtually vanished when the claims were brought to light.Still, his diehard fans are pulling for a comeback.Over the last year, Datsik has remained silent on socials and entirely out of the spotlight. Back in October, these screenshots suggested he had become sober and intended on making a comeback in the future.Another more recent screenshot reiterates his plans to return to music. He’s just waiting for the “right time.”Datsik responds to a fan via dm: “There will be the right time for it but certain things I need to figure out first.

"Shortly after Avicii’s death in 2018, Geffen A&R Neil Jacobson spoke to in an interview and called the music Avicii had been working on his “best music in years.”At the time, the fate of this collection of music was uncertain. His family, father Klas Bergling and mother Anki Lidén, retained control of his estate, including his music. Now, they’re creating the Tim Bergling Foundation, the goal of which will be, among other things, to support organisations that prevent suicide. A final album of Avicii’s work, , will also be released this year.In a new interview with , friends and co-producers on the album Kristoffer Fogelmark, Salem al Fakir, and Albin Nedler describe Avicii’s state of mind after retiring from touring.“It felt like Tim was coming back to life,” said al Fakir.And yet, some songs suggested there was a darkness underneath.The first single from the album, “SOS,” out this Wednesday, April 10, contained lyrics like, “Can you hear  and “Tim talked about the lyrics as if they were in the past. A period which had been difficult that he had moved on from,” remarks Fogelmark. “When I hear these songs now I can’t stop thinking, hell – is this how he was really feeling? Could I have done anything?”“SOS” will certainly stir up some emotions in fans – it’s out Wednesday. The full album  comes out June 6 and contains 16 never before released Avicii songs. aviciibest musicFamilyFriendsinterviewNew AlbumproducersSOStimLover of all bass music.

"Ultra Music Festival returns to Miami in 2020 — but, where will it go? After claiming a new home on Virginia Key, music festival organizers hope to return. However, some key Miami officials don’t believe it’s a good idea.Ultra Miami gave 2019 everything it had, with a new venue, new stages, a brand new Resistance Island concept. However, the late nights were plagued with backed up traffic and transportation. Attendees were forced to walk the bridge by the thousands after a long day of partying.Despite the complications, Ultra’s chief of security Ray Martinez says he hopes to return to the key with a “well-oiled production.” He said, “It was a great event in a beautiful location, and we look forward to being here next year and producing — and even improving on — our event and our festival.”Mayor Francis Suarez, City Manager Emilio Gonzalez and other admins are expected to meet with representatives to review what worked and what didn’t during the 3-day event, which brought in over 55,000 people each day.“I think putting 50,000 people in Virginia Key is not a good idea,” Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Monday. “There’s only one way in and one way out. I think they need to find a better place for it.”From Bayfront Park to Virginia Key — where will Ultra Miami end up next? Miami Herald 2020city of miamilocationultra miamiultra music festivalvenuevirginia keyWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

" is going all out for its final season. While the lead characters are gunning for the throne, The Weeknd, SZA, and Travis Scott are teaming up to bring a new song to the wildly popular HBO series.Generally speaking, the show tends to go with intense, theatrical productions that compliment the battle scenes and everything else that plays out on screen. Just recently, Migos broke the mold with an unexpected new version of the “Game of Thrones Main Title Theme,” (listen here).The The Weeknd x SZA x Travis Scott collab started as a mere rumor on Reddit and a Travis Scott fan page. However, a source close to the project has confirmed to Pitchforkthat it’s most definitely happening — just in time for the final season.According to the same source, GOT enlisted in The Weeknd to make a track for the series. He then brought on SZA and Travis Scott for the triple-threat collab.The final season of will commence this Sunday, April 14, 2019 on HBO.

"Camp EDC debuted in 2018 and was far from perfect. Long wait times the first day forced many to turn back to the strip and get hotels for the night; others experienced issues with their ShiftPods like missing amenities or power problems. Of course, this was the first time Camp EDC had ever been executed, and some hiccups were to be expected.Thankfully, for 2019, it looks like there are going to be a lot of new features, improved amenities, redesigned components, and additional conveniences.Most importantly on the list, the amount of lanes for ShiftPod campers checking in will be increased five fold. There will also be more eco-friendly grass spread out over the camp area — over 2 million sq ft. More food and drink selections, more chill and shade areas, better access to WiFi and power, as well as 24-hour restrooms and showers should make the Camp EDC experience in 2019 much, much more amenable.See the new map and all of the improvements in the graphics below, including the massive Mesa area.⛺️🙌 Introducing the New & Improved Camp EDC layout for 2019! 👈✅ Swipe left to see the all the updates, including separate RV & Car entrances, shorter wait times, artificial eco-grass covering entire campgrounds, improved power grid & more. 👈🤗 https://t.co/Dzye01QN7a pic.twitter.com/QUhFsv6q0p— EDC (@EDC_LasVegas) April 8, 2019  Camp EDCdrinkentrancefeaturesfoodImprovementsLover of all bass music.

"Back in March, Rezz announced that her new EP is done. “EP,” being the operative phrase, indicates that Rezz will probably not release another album for the third year in a row, but take things a bit slower in 2019. That being said, new Rezz is new Rezz and we’re not in any position to cry foul about how many tracks we’re getting.No word has been given on release date yet, but it probably won’t be until around June. Rezz just tweeted that she’s going to “debut a couple songs” at EDC Las Vegas, which is in May — logic follows that if the EP were already released, they wouldn’t be debuts.Check back in May for live videos of these tunes as the Cult will definitely be on the lookout in Vegas.

"Jackson Gibbons, a 15-year-old, died at under-18 rave at Lakota nightclub in Bristol in 2018. His parents reported him missing on April 2, 2018, after he phoned them and told them he had taken drugs, but would not tell them where he was.An inquest this week at Avon Coroner’s Court in Bristol revealed that Gibbons died as a result of taking ecstasy at “six times what would be considered a ‘safe’ level of the drug in his blood and was seen ‘shaking violently’ and ‘struggling to breathe.'”A friend who was with Gibbons neglected to call an ambulance or alert anyone for more than an hour after he began to first show a reaction to the drugs.According to Daily Mail, “A report from Dr Balboa, Jackson’s GP, detailed how between the ages of 13 and 15, Jackson had been considered a suicide risk.“The GP report stated that Jackson was admitted to various hospitals ten times between March 2015 and December 2017 for drug overdoses,” he continued.During the inquest, it was further revealed that Gibbons’ friend was the one who supplied him with the drugs. He and another friend had taken them, as well, and were deemed to be in an unfit state of mind during the incident. It’s unclear if either of them will be charged contributing to Gibbons’ death.Assistant Coroner Dr Simon Fox recorded Gibbons’ cause of death as toxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy.If you are in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741.  deathecstasymdmaOverdosereported missingsix timesteenagerUKLover of all bass music.

"Back in February, Marshmello made a simple tweet: he needed to do a song with Cardi B this year. It was less of a New Year’s resolution and more of a personal affirmation, but for one of the biggest DJs in the world, it was something he could make happen.Queue yesterday on Cardi B’s Instagram story (video below) and she’s very clearly hinting at a new song with the saccharine performer.If she’s trying to be sly (we think not), it’s not really working.No word yet on any preview or release date, but this certainly seems like something that is already in the works..@IAmCardiB teases an upcoming collaboration with @MarshmelloMusic in new Instagram story. pic.twitter.com/oR51zdXQv2— Pop Crave (@PopCrave) April 7, 2019 Cardi Bcollaborationhit recordinstagram storymarshmelloLover of all bass music.

"Marshmello dropped his collaboration with CHVRCHES, “Here With Me,” at the beginning of March to mixed reviews. However, just like his track with Bastille, this one too has gone on to become wildly popular and defy expectations on the charts and on the radio.Last night, the two appeared together for their first live performance of the collaboration and it went down perfectly. A dim blue light enveloped the band and Marshmello as they performed, Lauren Mayberry on vocals and Marshmello playing guitar.More than anything, I’d wager that this performance acts as a litmus test for other Marshmello live music shows — he’s certainly big enough at this point to put together one large show with all of his myriad collaborators to come and perform the songs live with him, and it would definitely be a huge pull in terms of crowd numbers. Though nothing of the sort has been proposed or even rumored, it wouldn’t surprise me to see something like it either this year or next.Check out the live performance below.

"UPDATE 4/10 | Avicii’s new song “SOS” with Aloe Blacc is out now. Listen here.Avicii‘s tragic death has left many questions — and fans are hoping his new music will provide answers. The producer took his own life at age 28 on April 20, 2018. Coming up on a year, his posthumous album is almost here.This June, his family has plans to oversee the release of , an entire album nearly finished at the time of his passing. The first track, “S.O.S.” arrives April 10th. As the title suggests, it may be a call for help. recently sat down with Avicii’s closest family and peers to get a better grip on his latest music and his state of mind at the time of his death. Which, may be closely related if we listen.No matter who you ask, Avicii was in a better place than friends and family had seen him in years, leading up to his unexpected death. They describe him as “excited.” He made plans and he seemed to look forward to the future. It’s a dramatic contrast from the star’s defeated state seen in the documentary. Again, this leaves more questions than answers.For the new, forthcoming single, “S.O.S.” Avicii wrote lines that Aloe Blacc sings with a “special urgency.” He’s the same voice behind “Wake Me Up.”According to the article, most of Avicii’s songs were 75 – 80 percent completed at the time of his death. He left behind specific notes about them on his phone and computer. It was almost as though he knew someone else would have to finish the music for him.For the last six months, Carl Falk has been the one working diligently in studio with a ghost. “I was trying to produce through someone else’s eyes and ears — someone who’s not here,” he explains. “It was really hard not to criticize yourself the whole time. Would he like this? What would he have done?”His entire team believes that whatever Avicii had to say, he says it through this album.

"Apart from Coachella’s main lineup, attendees can always count on at least two auxiliary parties to keep things interesting even when the usual stages aren’t popping: Do Lab and Heineken. The Do Lab dropped its lineup a couple weeks ago, but it’s taken until now — 8 days before showtime — for Heineken to follow suit.The lineup for this year’s Heineken House is particularly interesting and seemingly rather disjointed… but interesting. Friday will feature a Jauz Bite This! label takeover each weekend, with additional support throughout the day from Tisoki, Tynan, Skepsis, Sikdope, and Dillon Nathaniel, with Holy Goof on W1 and Ookay on W2.Saturday will feature an interesting assortment of artists for the Heineken House, with The Roots, De La Soul, and Pete Tong headlining things on W1. W2 will feature more typical “EDM” lineup with Benzi, Dirty Audio, Wolfgang Gartner, PAZ, Ravell, and more.Sunday is where the bass heads will be, with Ghastly W1 and Liquid Stranger W2. They’ll be supported by Badklaat (W1), Decadon, Midnight Tyrannosaurus, Niiko x Swae, Space Laces (W2), Spock, Ubur, and Whipped Cream.Remember, the Heineken House is free to enter within Coachella, but you’ll want to get in line far ahead of when you want to be inside, because there is a strict capacity within the tent. Keep an eye on the line and ask the attendant at the front about general wait times and you should be just fine.Check out the full lineup below — set times for Heineken House, Do Lab, and Coachella should be coming later this week.The @Heineken_US lineup is here.

"Ultra Music Festival went down last weekend and the following days have been all about getting caught up on the live sets. Literally, almost all of them (listen here). However, there’s one very important set that made way to the stream, but was never officially uploaded.Illenium took the Live Stage at 11 pm on Saturday to throw down a proper set filled with tons of his own music. Those watching the stream were dazzled by his performance from home. Those in the crowd were filled with energy, hanging on every word of every song. As his fans will tell you, it was one of the best sets of the entire weekend.In an interesting move, Illenium hasn’t uploaded the official audio from his set. Fans have been dying to hear the performance in high quality audio, but it doesn’t seem like that’s a possibility. Not now or ever.When Ultra nudged the producer to upload his set, he answered back via Reddit days later, saying they used an “incorrect audio source” and they “didn’t have the live elements leveled properly.” In addition, though Illenium doesn’t mention it himself, those watching the stream heard the strange sound of a saxophone during his performance. This was later revealed to be Dom from Big Gigantic soundchecking, who came out at the end of his set as a special guest.Hahahah Dom from big g was soundcheckjng and the stream was using a different audio source than the show. So that was just for stream viewers and they didn’t fix it 😐— ILLENIUM (@ILLENIUMMUSIC) April 1, 2019You can still hear the set, but it just won’t sound the best.

But, this is coming from a three time DMC World champion here.Craze speaks out in a recent tweet:He adds:DJs including Anna Lunoe, Wuki, JOYRYDE and more have chimed in, sharing whether they opt for sync or not in certain situations. The consensus is — if you want to use it, use it.

I’m not sure what it is about her voice, but some mysterious quality lends itself to electronic music better than almost any other. She released “Close To Me” with Diplo and Swae Lee at the end of 2018, and now it’s received four official remixes, including a stellar, instant classic from Zeds Dead.Think of the Jakwob remix of “Starry Eyed” or the Bassnectar remix of “Lights” and you can imagine that a Zeds Dead remix of Ellie Goulding would be on a similar or higher level. Well, I wouldn’t say this is on the level of the “Lights” remix, but by Zeds Dead standards, this is definitely a new classic.Zeds Dead are on a run of new remixes with this one, including their recent remix of Billie Eilish’s “bury a friend,” and I absolutely love it. It feels like a revival of their classic sound and I’m hopeful for loads more original music in 2019, but these are definitely quelling a huge craving all the same.Check out Zeds Dead’s remix for “Close To Me” below, and listen to the full pack here. classicClose To Mediplodubstepellie gouldingremixSwae Leezeds deadLover of all bass music.

"It’s a true shame that Eric Prydz had to pull out of all his Miami events due to health reasons. Apart from his Cirez D back-to-back with Adam Beyer on Day 1, he also could not perform his set as the penultimate artist on the ASOT stage on Sunday night. Fortunately, Armin van Buuren is no stranger to long sets and filled in for Prydz as well as played his own timeslot.The result was a massive 3.5 hour journey that crowd won’t soon forget. While it’s not the longest Armin has played by a long shot, nor is it even the most elaborate production he’s been afforded, it’s still the longest he’s ever played at Ultra in 10 years of being booked to perform.Armin kept the vibes genuine for the first 90 minutes of the performance, spinning almost entirely with a backlight, letting the music do the talking. The following 120 minutes were his original set time, and so the vibe changed dramatically once he was let loose to play a true Armin Only-style set.Overall, it’s a captivating visual experience and you can watch all of it below right now. Rukes.com 3.5 hoursarmin van buurenasoteric prydzfill-injourneyreplacementtranceultraLover of all bass music.

"The big three labels — Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Music — have reportedly demanded more money for songs played within TikTok, one of the hottest new apps. Also, its Chinese counterpart Douyin.According to reports, TikTok and Douyin are two of the fastest growing apps out there. They both focus a great deal on music, as many users tend to upload dancing and lip-synching videos set to popular music. To take the music away would be a massive hit (the bad kind) for the apps to say the least.However, the deals between ByteDance Ltd. and the labels are coming up on their expiration date. Inside sources say they have failed to progress negotiations since last year. Following the success of ByteDance Ltd’s assets, the company is valued at $75 billion and the labels want money — “hundreds of millions of dollars in guaranteed money.”TikTok’s head of global development Todd Schefflin has since responded, saying it shouldn’t be treated like a music streaming service — simply because it isn’t one.“TikTok is for short video creation and viewing, and is simply not a product for pure music consumption that requires a label’s entire collection,” he said. The platform provides an exciting way for content to trend and break through to wider audiences.”“TikTok’s music team partners with many great labels every day around the world forming long-term relationships, rather than just relying on transactional deals for a catalog of full songs,” he added. Bloomberg appmusicSony MusicTikTokUniversal MusicWarner MusicWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"The Chainsmokers proved this past Sunday night, once again, why they deserve to headline an event like Ultra Music Festival. They never brought out any rappers, they never relied on gimmicks, they just brought their 120% energy to the stage and played their hearts out. With drummer Matt McGuire in tow and a special appearance from Illenium to debut their forthcoming collaboration, it was easily one of the grandest sets of the weekend.Much like their set in 2018, The Chainsmokers played loads of new and unreleased music.Right off the bat, they started their set with an unreleased collab with Nolan van Lith and followed it right up with an unreleased track from Edison Cole and Lookas.They played their Stoltenhoff collaboration once again, which they played in 2018 and still hasn’t been released. They also dropped new music with Luca Lush, Quix, THIEVES, Crankdat and ARMNHMR; and also, according to 1001tracklists, UNKWN, Styles&Complete, and Gammer.Listen to their set below and pay attention to hear these awesome new tracks.0:00 – The Chainsmokers & Nolan van Lith – ID (Intro Edit)

"Sadly, a worker passed away today at the Empire Polo Club on the grounds of Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival. According to police, the man fell to his death in the staging area just a week out from the event.Indio police spokesman Ben Guitron said the call was received around 9:30 am Saturday morning. There was an accident at the Empire Polo Club — respond to Avenue 50 and Monroe Street.California initially noted a “traumatic injury” after a person “fell from a roof and perished at the scene” near that intersection. Guitron later confirmed that a worker in the staging area on festival grounds had fallen and died at the scene.Another report from TMZ sourced eyewitnesses that said the worker was “climbing the stage scaffolding and fell about 60 feet” to his fatal death. They also observed the man wasn’t “clipped in” or wearing any safety harness.Goldenvoice’s spokesperson did not immediately respond to either publication’srequest for comment.The devastating news comes as Coachella nears. The music festival takes place over next weekend and the following, April 12-14 and 19-21, 2019.This is a developing story.

"It’s the end of an era as Red Bull Music Academy and Red Bull Radio have plans to shut down.The brands will reportedly “phase out the existing structure” by October 2019. This comes as Yadarstar and Red Bull have mutually agreed to dissolve partnership, along with their collaborative projects.Since 1998, RBMA has been known for workshops, festivals, studio sessions and other events. Most importantly, for connecting artists all over the world in over 60 different countries. The success and excitement backing the academy led to the formation of a 24/7 radio station and editorial hub. Plus, other media including podcasts, print, books, films, etc.Over the years, artists including Flying Lotus, SOPHIE, Salva, TOKiMONSTA, Ekali, Nina Kraviz and many more have been involved with RBMA. The news hits hard for established artists and up-and-comers alike, but this certainly won’t be the last we hear from the brand.In a statment to Resident Advisor, Red Bull said:Yadarstar ended its own bittersweet statement from the co-founders with:Red Bull Music Festival, which operates separately, will continue on as planned in New York and Tokyo.pic.twitter.com/Xh2DuxmzRt— Yadastar (@yadastar) April 3, 2019 PitchforkResident Advisor RBMAred bullRed Bull Music Academyred bull music festivalRed Bull RadioWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Zeds Dead and JAUZ made waves when they dropped their first original collaboration “Lights Go Down” in 2017. Now, a little less than two years later, and a full b2b tour later, the two are teaming up again for another new fire track.At Ultra this past weekend, Zeds Dead closed out the Worldwide stage on Sunday night by bringing out JAUZ to play out their new collab to the wild crowd.

"Last October, Ekali announced his debut album was coming in 2019. After a series of successful songs and a debut EP, it was the next logical step. Now 6 months later, and he’s announce it’s ready.“New music next week,” he begins in a tweet, “then we start rolling out songs from the album.”New music next week, then we start rolling out songs from the album 🙂— Ekali 🥀 (@EkaliMusic) April 3, 2019From the way the tweet is composed, it’s safe to assume that no album tracks have yet been released. That being said, there are a couple Ekali IDs floating around out there, including his Skrillex collaboration.If we estimate 12 tracks and 3 singles, following next week’s independent release, with around 2-3 weeks between each single, then we’ll be getting his album sometime in July or August. Of course, that’s at best an educated guess. But still, it’s close enough on the horizon to be very, very excited.  albumekalirolloutteaserLover of all bass music.

"On Sunday, March 24, I had a lot of thoughts on the week leading up to and the weekend of Ultra Music Festival. What can one say in a review that captures what happened in its entirety? Making my way past the Live Arena with Armin van Buuren and the Worldwide Stage with Zeds Dead, I turned back and looked at the main stage marking the last time I would see it this past weekend. The Chainsmokers were there throwing down a set featuring the bass components of Illenium, NGHTMRE, Gammer and the like with live renditions and remixes of their own hits. And then it hit me. As to what hit me and how, we’ll need to extrapolate on the whole weekend and the context surrounding it.Leading up to Ultra Music Festival 2019 was some of the most confused hype of any music festival, especially in EDM. After another successful year at Bayfront Park in Downtown Miami in 2018, everyone in attendance witnessed what had become the standard expectations that Ultra delivers. This includes the following:These points are what has made Ultra Music Festival in Bayfront Park one of the most coveted and phenomenal music festival productions the world has to offer. Couple that with the sweetest real estate and it becomes clear as daylight why people from over 105 different countries book flights and hotels months in advance for this event.So when news broke that Ultra were ousted from Bayfront Park by the city and its residents five months later, it felt like UMF had to work with a 180 flip on everything they had been getting right since 2012. They had to use the time that it takes them to do all the aforementioned points while finding a whole new location in five months. And when they reached an agreement with the city council of Miami to relocate to Virginia Key, they faced backlash from two new parties: the residents/mayor of Key Biscayne and Rapture Electronic Music Festival.But despite the speed-bumps and improvisation that led to last weekend, Ultra Music Festival 2019 still happened. As much as the elements appeared to tower against this event, its organizers, and its attendees, Ultra Music Festival curated eight stages for 170,000 fans across the weekend that included surprise guests and viral moments. Hell, a guy wearing a cartoon-style Colonel Sanders (Kentucky Fried Chicken) helmet took to the main stage to perform in the five-minute space between two sets and we’re still talking about it. That’s without even diving into the other events that have evolved into their own stories. This includes but is not limited to Malaa’s unorthodox prison release, Cash Cash treating a mixer like Steve Aoki treats cake, or Shaquille O’Neal moshing during NGHTMRE and Slander’s Gud Vibrations set.And we have to talk about the elephant that walked 2.5 miles on the Rickenbacker Causeway last Friday night. As one of the tens of thousands of attendees stuck in Virginia Key and seeing a tree burst into flames, things got scary for a moment. And after we crossed the bridge, it was easier to find ride-sharing options to get home as soon as possible. But Ultra Music Festival was quick to respond to what happened at the end of Day 1. They were also swift with tackling the issues with shuttles and congested lines that made Day 2 and Day 3 operations smooth and easy. Lines for shuttles and the ferry were managed with better instructions and cooperation from staff.And to the people saying that this was a Fyre Festival sequel or equal to TomorrowWorld’s 2015 disaster, they do nothing but mis-characterize the entire situation.The only issue Ultra Music Festival struggled with that affected attendees all three days was the distance between the Miami Marine Stadium and Historic Virginia Key Park. The stadium’s parking lot was the site of Ultra’s Main, Live, Worldwide, and Radio stages while the Carl Cox Megastructure, Reflector, Arrival, and Oasis stages invaded the park on their own Resistance Island. On one hand, this allowed the mainstream acts to be grouped on one side of the event and the underground house, tech house, and techno sets remained on the other side.On the other hand, the distance between these two sites was quite a walk. It was such a walk that Ultra designated special staircases for guests to avoid crossing busy streets. The trail was expertly filled with speakers and LED screens with music and visuals to keep the entertainment flowing, but that walk was killer for fans of acts on both sides of the event. For example, if an Ultra attendee wanted to see Tom Morello perform at the Live Stage starting at 7pm but also wanted to see Loco Dice at the Megastructure at 8pm, they would have to leave between 15-30 minutes before the end of the first set to make it in time for the start of the second set. If Ultra can shorten the gap between these two sides of their own event for the future, it would be a return to what makes Ultra Music Festival a special experience where all the acts are immediately and easily accessible.The sets between both sites were incredible and varied, as expected. Catching Enrico Sangiuliano or Camelphat going back-to-back with Solardo was an incandescent inferno of lasers and ravers. Meanwhile, the UMF Radio stage was the site of some of the greatest stretch of versatility. Drum and bass icon Spor or bounce house star Justin Mylo was a super-charged punch of bass, rhythm, and energy. By the Main stage, acts like Fedde le Grand reminded us what fans love about electronic music while the Gud Vibrations set by NGHTMRE & Slander set a new bar for dubstep/trap DJs everywhere. And probably the top set of all was with Skrillex and Boys Noize resurrecting Dog Blood with new music, unmatched vigor and a special appearance from Ty Dolla $ign.Looking back at the mayhem and jubilee that followed these three days, the thoughts of Ultra continued to swirl. Their new chapter from a rocky start to their powerful closing was something that only Ultra Music Festival could have pulled off. That was my realization. Only Ultra could plan an event with less than five full months of planning and still pull off a spectacular event on almost every front. When you consider the environmental, political, and logistical hurdles this organization had to deal with and overcome, it makes you wonder how they didn’t fail. Maybe it’s because they have a remarkable staff from top to bottom. Maybe it’s because the fans refused to let Day 1’s issues to define the whole weekend. Maybe it’s because the music was just too great. Or maybe it’s because, despite all the problems Ultra Music Festival overcame to throw their 21st edition, they still met their own high standards and gave us the only reason to catch them again in 2020. carl coxCash Cashcolonel sandersDog Bloodkentucky fried chickenkfcMalaamiamiMiami Marine StadiumnghtmreshaqslanderThe ChainsmokersTom Morelloultraultra miamiultra music festivalultra music festival 2019umfumf 2019virginia keyMusic enthusiast would be an understatement.

"1788-L made waves just last weekend with the announcement of their second EP coming out on Deadbeats this April 26th. Taking to the skies to reveal the news, airplane banners over Miami Music Week and Ultra stoked the flames for the follow up to 1788-L’s 2018 debut EP, also on Zeds Dead’s label Deadbeats.Today, 1788-L showcases what’s to come on his forthcoming sophomore project,  in the way of lead single “M A L F U N K T” with Deathpact. It’s a tune he’s been rinsing in his sets for a while now, along with so many other IDs, and I’m excited to finally get the full experience.Like so many of 1788-L’s other tracks, “M A L F U N K T” is rife with glitchy synths and a foreboding melody. But with the addition of those suspenseful arpeggios in the beginning and other more cinematic elements, the journey on this one just feels different.Get it here and listen below, out now via Deadbeats. 1788-LdeadbeatsDeathpactmalfunktnew epsynthetikLover of all bass music.

"Apple Music has reportedly gained the edge on Spotify for the most paid subscribers in the U.S. first broke the news on Friday, announcing a shift that escalates the already stiff competition between streaming platforms.In February 2019, Apple Music locked in 28 million paid subscribers in the U.S. and Spotify had 26 million. According to the report, Apple Music took over with a steady 2.6% – 3% growth rate, compared to Spotify’s average 1.5% – 2%.Unlike Apple Music, Spotify has a free version driven by ads. When taking that into consideration, Spotify has 207 million users and still far exceeds Apple Music’s active listeners.Spotify also has more overall subscribers worldwide.The companies aren’t exactly playing nice with each other. Spotify’s CEO put Apple on blast last month for “unfair” polices in its App Store and filed an antitrust complaint with the European Commission. Apple responded with a statement that Spotify was focusing on “its financial motivations in misleading rhetoric.”Do you use Spotify or Apple Music for everyday listening?

"There are many facets of music which is best explored through genres. For example, if you love an ensemble of guitars, bass, drums, and singing, then enter rock. But if you want the tempo to remain at 136 beats per minute with emphasis on melody and kick, trance is right for you. But what if these two seemingly distant genres clashed head to head in a collaborative effort?Enter Armin van Buuren and Van Halen’s David Lee Roth. Although this has been attempted in the past, none are of highest profile than that of these two, respective legends. During Ultra Music Festival 2019, the two took to the main stage to unveil Armin van Buuren’s remix of Van Halen’s omega-classic song “Jump.” While van Buuren was behind the stage, Roth took the microphone in the way he has for decades and sang the lyrics that everyone and their mother know by heart.ARMIN VAN HALEN © pic.twitter.com/jNlf1CHtQP— Your EDM (@YourEDM) March 31, 2019Luckily, we were able to set an interview with the two superstars before that epic moment in cross-genre/Ultra history.

"Despite its depictions in mainstream media, the annual Burning Man event has been a paragon of integrity, cultural awareness, and environmental stewardship for the past 28 years. According to a new post on the official Burning Man website, a new Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the Burning Man Event threatens to radically alter the event’s core principles and puts its future in jeopardy.There are many issues within the EIS that present cause for concern within the Burning Man Project staff, including a private Bureau of Land Management security team, obstacles to their Leave No Trace policy, and more.Some specific examples:Burning Man claims that all of the proposed changes would result in an increased cost of $286 per person visiting Black Rock City for the event. And perhaps even more troubling is that BLM would actually “benefit financially from these increased expenses through their existing requirements to take a percentage of a permit holder’s gross revenue.”In response, Burning Man Project is calling on its attendees and family to voice their concerns and submit feedback while the Draft EIS is still under consideration. The deadline to provide comment is April 29.Learn more about what you can do to voice your opinion via the Burning Man Journal here. black rock citybureau of land managementburning manburning man projectenvironmental impact statementFuturethreatenedLover of all bass music.

"Fans have been hoping for new Avicii music ever since the artist’s passing in April 20, 2018. While for most artists that seems outside of logical thought, Avicii had a stockpile of so many works in progress that his collaborators could continue working on them and still have plenty of his influence.Now, it’s been officially revealed that new Avicii music is coming.The first single ”SOS” will be released on April 10 and the album, titled , on June 6. The collection will contain 16 never released Avicii collaborations.The net proceeds from the album will go to the nonprofit Tim Bergling Foundation and the purposes it will work for, among other things, to prevent mental illness and suicide.While we still mourn Avicii’s passing, this is extremely exciting and we eagerly await new music next week along with the full album in June. Rukes.com aviciicharityFull AlbumNew MusicofficialproceedsSOStimLover of all bass music.

"Releasing a song that is career-defining poses a particular challenge to an artist. At first, it’s great to revel in the success that it affords you, but then comes the feat of topping it. Fans learn of you and grow with you because of that one song, like Ookay with “Thief” or Fisher with “Losing It.” But it also tends to pigeon hole you as an artist, which can be a very precarious position for someone looking to expand their creative identity.The same thing happened to Jai Wolf in 2015 with “Indian Summer,” which has arguably sustained him by itself for the past four years. But with such a song looming overhead, the desire to forge past it grows stronger, and that’s what Jai Wolf has done with his debut album out today, . is not “Indian Summer,” and knowing that before going in is going to help with a bit of the shell shock, I assure you. The album is heavily influenced by pop and artists like M83, Capital Cities, The Shins, and while an electronic sound is at the album’s core, it’s not the main focus.There’s a variety between instrumental and vocal tracks, as well as more electronic and more pop-leaning, that keeps  from ever feeling stale or monotonous. The ebb and flow between the styles serves both to keep old fans interested as well as new, and that’s not an easy feat to accomplish by any means.Whether fans will continue to come back to Jai Wolf’s debut album down the line and what their view of it will be depends entirely on where he goes from here. After all, an artist’s work is never truly over. However, for now,  will be my companion on any lonely night.Listen below, out now via Mom+Pop. debut albumelectronicindiejai wolfpopthe cure to lonelinessLover of all bass music.

"Let’s not mince words: people at music festivals take drugs. Not everyone who takes drugs can handle themselves when they’re on drugs. One of those people happens to be a friend of Drew Carey.In a new episode of the comedy series This Is Not Happening on YouTube, Drew Carey describes the experience of looking after one of his friends after he experiences a couple bad trips at EDC Las Vegas and TomorrowWorld. (Also, sentences I thought I’d never write…) The whole routine lasts a little under 14 minutes and it’s scary just how relatable Carey’s story should be to most of us.Without spoiling anything too major, the story involves LSD, molly, shrooms, and weed, though not all at the same time, as well as threats against life and a wild helicopter ride over TomorrowWorld.Probably the best thing about the routine is the fact that it comes from someone as wholesome as the host of The Price Is Right, which Carey makes sure to remind the audience of every chance he gets.

"UPDATE 7:03 PM PDT | Getter has officially cancelled the remainder of his tour.Getter’s  album is a work of art, plain and simple. It’s his soul reflected in music, albeit a tired and troubled one. And while we’d love to say that his fans have been able to sympathize with his new sound, there’s a drastic disconnect between those listening to his album at home and those going out to see him perform live.There’s been a few times on his Visceral Tour that Getter has made public statements about a crowd’s reaction to his music. Very early on in the tour, he made a post about accepting criticism and changing things up a bit — this post was made in what seemed like a positive tone, in the sense that he wanted to bring the best show possible to his fans. But later, he was booed during a performance in Houston, which definitely didn’t receive the same reaction.Then, this past weekend at Ultra, some issue with the sound resulted in Getter giving fans a performance that wasn’t his 100% best and he felt crushed because of it.Now, it breaks my heart to see Getter posting so defeated on Twitter: “this is my last tour, over it.”this is my last tourover it— 𝕲𝖊𝖙𝖙𝖊𝖗 (@GetterOfficial) April 3, 2019No one can can blame Getter for feeling this way; the reaction from a select group of fans to his new tour has been anything but positive, and it has to be hard on him to constantly go up against fans who still think he’s the same artist he was when he first started.We’ve yet to see if Getter will follow through with this tweet, or if the words of encouragement from fans will bring him back. But we certainly hope for the latter. gettertwitterVisceral TourLover of all bass music. I'm not afraid to speak my mind and put it to paper, and I do it often.

"Most, if not all, of the artists who were featured on this past weekend’s live stream during Ultra Music Festival have begun uploading their HQ sets to their own channels. For many artists, this means fans will be listening to and watching these sets for years to come, much like I, personally, revisit Zedd’s 2017 Ultra set or The Chainsmokers’ 2018 set.But, not all that glitters is gold. Oliver Heldens, one of the artists on this weekend’s stream, is calling out DJs for buying fake views. he says in his tweet.Heldens never explicitly says anything about Ultra, but it’s not hard to connect the timing of this tweet with the fact that DJs are starting to upload their sets.As he says, the discrepancy in the view/like/comment ratio is readily apparent even to untrained eyes, so why do it? It’s a question we’ll perhaps never have the answer to, but Heldens for one is sick of it. We are, too.Buying fake views on DJ sets to get noticed easier? This year again I spot (big) DJs doing it. What’s ur opinion on this? I refuse to participate in this, cause people r not stupid, it’s very easy to recognize the fake views (view/like/comment ratio), so why do people do this??— Oliver Heldens (@OliverHeldens) April 3, 2019 Rukes.com buying fake viewscalling outfake viewslive setsOliver Heldensratiosultra music festivalLover of all bass music.

"There’s been a massive rise of live performers in electronic music over the past few years. Groups like ODESZA and RÜFÜS DU SOL have been at the forefront of this movement and have inspired a whole new wave of composers and producers. Not the least of which is Big Wild, the east coast born and west-coast based producer/composer/vocalist Jackson Stell. Having risen to fame over the past couple of years, Big Wild has made a name with the indie dance crowd through his remixes for artists such as ZHU, CHVRCHES, GRiZ, and Sylvan Esso. He’s also been an absolute fan favorite on the festival circuit having played everywhere from EDC Las Vegas, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and CRSSD.Now, Jackson has taken the next step in his musical evolution, having released his debut album, , on Counter Records. Not only has the album racked up over nine million streams on Spotify alone, Jackson took Big Wild on the road for a solo headlining tour, playing to sold out crowds across the country.

"Yesterday was a tough day for Getter, who, in the face of overwhelming criticism and hate from a select group of so-called fans, cancelled the remainder of his Visceral tour with only seven dates left. Booing at shows and getting objects thrown at him were the last straws of his last vestment of hope in the tour, and he offered a defeated and distressing note to these individuals, saying, “you win.”In the face of such blatant toxicity, not just in the bass community but perhaps more pervasive in dance music as a whole, legions of Getter’s friends and colleagues leapt to his support. It was never so much as calling out any one individual as pointing out the hypocrisy of those buying a ticket to a VISCERAL TOUR show and then getting mad they heard music from his album.Jauz, Excision, Alison Wonderland, Ekali, Thys of Noisia, Feed Me, and more had words of encouragement and support for Getter yesterday and this morning. There are a lot to read through below, but you’ll probably end up feeling a lot more hopeful for the the future by the end of it.Hopefully Getter feels the same way soon.there's too many words I have for this @GetterOfficial situation so I'll keep it short and sweet. If he had put out the same music, done the same tour under a different name everyone would've ate that shit up. but because he tried to be himself yall destroyed it. good going 🖕— JAUZ (@Jauzofficial) April 4, 2019personally I hope and believe this won't be the end of @GetterOfficial and in a year or two from now all those kids who trashed Visceral will be the ones lining up 4 hours early to buy merch and have a meet and greet. Real music doesn't go away and neither will Tanner or his fans— JAUZ (@Jauzofficial) April 4, 2019Additionally, don’t think for a second that buying a ticket to a show gets you anything but exactly what the artist intends to give you. You aren’t entitled to hear old music.— Ekali 🥀 (@EkaliMusic) April 4, 2019Keep doin what you want, and fuck the people who can’t understand that you want to push the boundaries and grow as a person and as an artist. Those are the people who keep this scene stagnant and lame. Keep goin bro— Lost Kings (@wearelostkings) April 4, 2019Exactly. Just like when @Avicii did his country set at Ultra and were going how his career is over and it was all crap. Then lo and behold months later “oh shit yeah this is amazing!”— rukes (@rukes) April 4, 2019do what u feel tanner, but this is hard as shit!only way to make this image even harder is to play melodies on that stage, which u already about. pic.twitter.com/aS5vsOKwKO— joyryde (@enJOYRYDE) April 4, 2019Please don’t give up.

There may be people who don’t enjoy ur new stuff, but do what makes u happy, true fans will be there.— Brownies & Lemonade (@TeamBandL) April 4, 2019It's rly depressing to see a musician being forced to quit making the music that he believes in based on negative reinforcement. Give musicians an opportunity to experiment & evolve their style. People change, times change, & music changes along the way. Art needs room to grow.— Brownies & Lemonade (@TeamBandL) April 4, 2019Man i can't actually believe people drove an amazing artist/person to quit his own tour. It genuinely hurts my heart and makes me feel disgusted. I don't think a lot of people realise how much hope/dreams/effort crawl into these projects. I'm really envious of getter that… https://t.co/S133ZpAmE8— EPTIC (@Eptic) April 4, 2019But fuck they're just people who had a passion and went for it, that should be applauded not shot down.

It’s a hard pain to overcome.— Modestep (@Modestep) April 4, 2019Sometimes when you fly to stardom overnight, you forget that not every fan is in it for the culture and music.

"Alison Wonderland has never been shy about sharing her inner demons, talking about her depression, or discussing mental illness with her followers. It’s this openness, in part, that engenders such deep devotion from her fans. Her new song out today, “Peace,” speaks directly to the inner demons within all of us and says that it will get better one day.“Now I am nervous,” she opined on Twitter. “I wrote [Peace] to help me find my own closure in something. I don’t feel at peace right now. In fact, I still feel kinda broken. No one gave me closure, I have to do it on my own.”The accompanying music video, also out today, finds Alison transitioning between a dark warehouse and brightly lit white and pure space. The dichotomy and juxtaposition is a clear metaphor for the instability of emotion and how easy it is to experience highs and lows.Watch below and follow along with the lyrics.[Intro]

"Elton John’s glasses. Slash’s hat. Malaa’s balaclava. ATLien’s masks. Black Tiger Sex Machine’s masks. Golden Features’ mask.Each of these artists has a specific feature or piece of clothing, or a mask, that defines their brand. For Skrillex, apart from his music and genial demeanor, it’s been his hair. That side-swept, undercut, flowing long hair influenced so many people in 2011-2012 to do the same that we couldn’t even believe it.However, after two appearances in Miami this past weekend and a busy year ahead, Skrillex has seemingly decided to chop off the locks in an effort to rebrand and… it’s almost more than we can bear.Like a woman cutting her hair after a bad breakup, Skrillex is breaking up with his past self and getting ready to head into the rest of the year as a new man.I’m sure we’ll get used to it eventually, but it’s definitely going to take some time. Thankfully, it won’t take much longer than tomorrow as it’s April Fool’s and this isn’t real. BrandhaircutOWSLAskrillexLover of all bass music.

"Deadmau5 debuted his Cube 3.0 to the world this past weekend at Ultra Music Festival. Taking over the very last set at the Live Stage on Saturday (before it became the ASOT stage on Sunday), deadmau5 impressed with a feat of technology, techno, and house that only he could possibly achieve.Throughout the 100-minute set, he played all-original music, with the exception of the second song from Wehbba, “Mind Awake.” The Cube was revealed to be translucent when desired, or completely opaque when brightness was maxed out with visuals. It also spun 360 degrees and had a small degree of vertical rotation. It was truly a sight to behold.But it was also a lot for the generators to take, as around 50 minutes into the set, the sound went out. At that point, there was nothing Joel could really do and he sort of meandered about while it got sorted. After about 8 minutes, the music started back up and the show went on!Check out the marvel of technology and sound below.  cube 3.0deadmau5power outageultraworld debutLover of all bass music.

"It’s hard to decide which set was best at Ultra Music Festival this past weekend. Apart from all the sets that were featured on the live stream, there were a lot more that weren’t, including every artist on the Worldwide stage with the exception of Dog Blood.Arguably one of the better sets of the weekend was Tiësto on the main stage, who played an almost entirely original set, save for a few tracks from some of his best friends, collaborators, and label mates. The set was full of energy and even dipped into heavier bass notes at some point.While that kind of set is well and good, and what we’ve come to expect from Tiësto in the past couple years, there’s still a part in every OG Tiësto fan that misses his trance days. Well, it looks like we’re getting our wish.Ferry Corsten posted this picture of a younger Tiësto earlier today, clearly from his trance days. Guess who’s back?A post shared by  Ferry Corsten (@ferrycorsten) on And now, we have this exclusive poster for a Tiësto “Only The Classics” tour that is hitting eight major cities in the US.

"It’s well established that Deadmau5 and Marshmello haven’t had the greatest relationship over the years. The two have been at each other’s throats in the most contentious of ways, generally getting into it on Twitter. However, a new tweet from deadmau5 suggests that the two were able to find some common ground while at Ultra over the weekend and, here’s the kicker… they’re making a track together.Sources tell us the two were spotted palling around in the artist area, though both of them kept their masks on as a sort of negotiation tool, perhaps to “mask” their real emotions. Though, it clearly went well and we’re excited to hear what comes of these two very polar opposite producers.Deadmau5 isn’t entirely foreign to the pop world, though his more recent work has definitely leaned a bit more complex. As for Marshmello, while he certainly excels at pop, radio-friendly material, his skill as a producer is real.More info on this as it becomes available.  collaborationdeadmau5marshmelloreconcileultraWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Ultra’s shuttle service at the end of day 1 earned it the hashtag #FyreFestival2 on social media. The denunciation was ultimately unearned as the festival quickly improved its shuttle service for day 2, and even more so on day 3. But the irony was not lost on the universe as Andy King was attending the festival, the first since Fyre.You might not recognize the name immediately, but King was the “dick sucking guy” in the Netflix documentary about the festival. In an Instagram post on Sunday, he posted a picture of himself at Ultra’s main stage with the caption, “Attending my first festival since FYRE…taking notes,” with a laughing emoji.Surely the irony wasn’t lost on King himself.The festival ended its 21st edition on Sunday night with a headlining performance from The Chainsmokers, who brought out Illenium to debut their forthcoming collaboration.Ultra aims to return to Virginia Key in 2020, this time with a full year of planning rather than a hasty three months.

"The Chainsmokers brought the house down last night during their Ultra Music Festival finale performance on the main stage. Ultra 21 was fraught with many difficulties beginning with shuttle service issues on Night 1 and various sound failures, but ultimately concluded on a high note with hope for the future.One of the big moments during The Chainsmokers’ performance was bringing out Illenium to perform their unreleased collaboration for the first time ever. Now, in the aftermath of the performance, The Chainsmokers and Illenium have announced a new super group called BIG CITY DREAMIN.According to the announcement, the two will tour together in the fall with more new music between them.

"Ultra Music Festival sent off its 21st edition last night with headlining performances from The Chainsmokers, Armin van Buuren, Zeds Dead, testpilot, and more. Tens of thousands of people right now are either boarding flights home or being rudely awakened from a deep slumber by hotels informing them they’re past check out time. But, according to reports, there are still some people left on Virginia Key waiting for shuttles from Day 1.The shuttle service day one became national news after attendees were forced to walk the Rickenbacker Causeway back to downtown Miami in lieu of actual shuttles. Disorganization and general first-year glitches caused the malfunction, but it seems that some attendees just didn’t want to walk.“They told us that shuttles would be operational in a matter of hours and Charlene would be picking us up in shuttle N081,” said Joey Pazucci, who traveled to the festival from Brooklyn, NY, on Monday morning. “But N081 never came.”“So you just stayed here and waited?” Your EDM asked.“Yeah, what else was I supposed to do?” replied Pazucci.Others report beginning to walk the causeway and then turning back and waiting, citing “politeness” and “indecision.”A spokesperson for Ultra tells Your EDM that a search & rescue team is being prepped to bring the attendees home.“We just want everyone home safely, no matter the cost,” the spokesperson said. “Everyone deserves to sleep in their own bed.” @BWilliams_38 april foolsattendeesDisasterMusic Festivalsearch & rescueshuttlesstrandedultra music festivalvirginia keyLover of all bass music.

"Ultra Music Festival enjoyed its new home on Virginia Key in Miami this past weekend with three full days of performance, going until 2am for the first time. Already going into the weekend with a grain of salt, Ultra didn’t do itself any favors by selling a timeslot to chicken fast food joint KFC on Friday afternoon.Colonel Sanders came on stage at 3:55 PM on Friday and played a 5 minute “set” in what would have otherwise been a silent changeover. Despite not actually taking a set “away” from any other DJ, the move still inspired scorn from the electronic music industry and fans alike.One of the first to call out the move was Marshmello, who tweeted, “This @kfc colonel sanders Djing at @ultra is lame. I can think of a lot of other artists that actually deserve to be on that stage instead.” That tweet has since been deleted.As it turns out, Your EDM has discovered that Marshmello himself, aka Chris Comstock, was the one under the mask the whole time. KFC figured that the masked DJ was already “anonymous” to a degree, “so switching out one mask for another didn’t seem like it would be a big deal,” the fast food chain told Your EDM.“We approached Ultra about the idea about a month before the festival with no idea who would actually play the set,” a KFC spokesperson said. “But when we started really thinking about it, there was no one who could pull off the masked DJ better than someone who was already a masked DJ, and that made our decision very easy.”In lieu of money, Marshmello was paid for the performance with a card affording him unlimited KFC meals for the next 50 years ($20 or less). Rukes.com april foolschickencolonel sandersfestivalkfcmarshmellomasked djSpecial Guestultra music festivalLover of all bass music.

"Immerse yourself in Telfort's nebula of rousing houseThe whirlwind DJ lifestyle of gigging and travelling is etched into Telfort’s musical MO. He fuses antithetical sounds together in harmonious blends, enveloping listeners in a nebula of uplifting house.The Edinburgh-based DJ and producer announced himself to wider attention with his debut EP ‘In a Good Place’ back in May 2015, taking the brave step to self-release on his newly-founded TLFT imprint. The record found many admirers, and he’s since followed it up with ‘Lickety Split’ and ‘Soon I Will Embark On A Journey’, establishing TLFT as an essential outlet for fans of house fuelled by rhythmic poise and melodic guile.Telfort stepped into new release pastures for his most recent offering, putting out the ‘Rooms For Speculation’ EP on Lionoil Industries in June 2018. It stands as his most rounded and accomplished work to date, exploring house’s emotional depth and dancefloor focus across four tracks.The Scottish artist draws inspiration from early house innovators such as Ron Trent, in tandem with Edinburgh greats like Linkwood and Fudge Fingas. The breadth of Telfort’s inspirations translates into the variety of tones and styles present within his music.You’ll find low-key thumping, dancefloor-ready tracks with deep and swift rumbling percussions; rapturous piano patterns which evoke tender lulls of summer warmth against boundless basslines; as well as orchestral strings and chiming melodies punctuated by recurring rips of acid. His music creates a sense of placeless intimacy, like drifting through the hushed and bumbling setting of a metropolis at dawn, with all its beats and sounds.He’s gained support from the likes of Move D, Axel Boman, Smallpeople, Moxie, Tim Sweeney, Jane Fitz, Jacques Renault and many more, as well as the love from Edinburgh’s local community. Telfort's Good Place parties have become a staple at the city’s revered Sneaky Pete’s, and he accompanies this popular residency with regular appearances at the monthly Lionoil nights which are spread across both Sneaky’s and The Bongo Club. Further afield, he recently made his US bow and played a debut gig at Offenbach’s beloved Robert Johnson nightspot, among other UK and European dates.Behind the decks, Telfort journeys across house music’s spectrum of light and dark, creating kaleidoscopic house trips. His In Session mix was recorded this sunny Easter Sunday, and it brims with all the life-giving energy needed to make you feel reborn.

"A master of cooking up hearty servings of feel-good dance music, the Brooklyn-based, Chicago-trained artist Moon Boots brings a whole new element of sound into his production with his mystical tune, 'Keramas' set for release via Anjunadeep as a double a-side with ‘Harpanet’.Drawing inspiration from his world travels, the track shows us how Moon Boots takes musical cues from the various environments he finds himself in.""The basis for 'Keramas' was a field recording I made when I had a couple days off in Bali during an Asian tour last summer“ Moon Boots tells Mixmag. “I was staying at a hotel on Keramas beach and heard these beautiful voices coming from off in the distance. Different women were taking turns on the mic singing beautiful melodies and a male preacher would also jump in with these strange hypnotic fragments. This was all blasting on a beat up loudspeaker so I was able to record it from outside the temple. The things that sound like sitars are just the singer’s voice sampled in short bits, and the bells are like my rough homage to gamelan.""People think of Bali as this incredible place to take a vacation, do some yoga, get in touch with nature, and all of that, but it also has this incredible musical culture that sometimes gets overlooked. When I recorded it I wasn’t planning on turning it into a track, I just wanted to have an interesting recording from the trip, something I could listen to and plant me back to that place and time.”Moon Boots joined Mixmag, AKG and a team of exceptional producers for a wholly unique electronic music retreat in forests of Woodstock, New York. With an emphasis on seclusion and artistic solidarity, Pete hit the studio to explore new sounds and reflect on how electronic music has altered his creative output forever.

"Powered byThe DJ/VJ/promoter and booking agency duo are championing diverse sounds and artistsVAJ.Power are the Glasgow outfit championing 140 BPM sounds, audiovisually stimulating raves and greater inclusivity in bass music.The duo, comprising Sofya Staune and Holly McGowan, met in 2015 while studying at Glasgow’s School of Art. 3AM coffee runs to their halls of residence kitchen was how they got acquainted, but their friendship was slow burning at first, accelerating when they discovered their mutual interest in 3D animation, interactive technology and music.Finding themselves amongst a supportive scene of fellow Glasgow-based musicians and artists, the duo began getting gigs as VJs. Taking inspiration from fluid identity celebrating artists Pussykrew, they began lighting up dances with striking imagery of formless figures. The following year saw them launch their club night FUSE, a diversity-focused, bass-driven night catering to fans of dubstep, grime and UK funky. Supporting local talent like K4CIE and Polonis is a key focus, while guests have included Berlin experimentalist Ziúr and London’s Sicaria Sound. The success of the audiovisual event led the pair to applying what they learned as VJs to the art of DJing.But 2018’s devastating fire in their spiritual and physical home of Glasgow venue The Art School left VAJ.Power at an impasse. They lost work as graphic designers and animators for The Art School’s other nights, as well as having to put their own event on hold while the building underwent renovation. With extra time on their hands, they decided to start a booking agency for musicians from Scotland and abroad. FUSE by VAJ.Power was launched with a dedicated club night in February. The following week, we pinned down the busy duo to talk about their journey so far.Check out an exclusive mix and Q+A from VAJ.Power below.How did your name VAJ.Power come about?We were basically sitting in Holly’s flat trying to come up with a name – we remember having this rant about how all artists in audiovisual fields are predominantly cis male, and how uninspiring the snippets of visuals and VJ sets that we found online were. So we started to joke about coming up with puns, and then ‘VAJ’ came up, which was quite tongue-in-cheek, as it’s short for Visual Audio Jockeys.Being AFAB (assigned female at birth), conversations around gender identity and representation are quite a big part of our practice, so it’s sometimes nice when people ask how we came up with it. We remember it was our second or third gig, when we had a conversation with a random guy near the club who complimented our visuals but said, “your name is kind of unfortunate though."" That was the moment when we realised we should stick with it! And it’s actually quite fun to see the sound of the word became normalised, even though some people have discomfort saying it still. It also kind of clicked when we started working on our logo – the word works quite nicely written down.Your output as animators often deals with the body. What informed this creative direction?It came quite naturally – as both non-binary persons, but not out at the time, it was what we were subconsciously drawn to when starting out with animation. We also found when we started our night FUSE that we wanted to develop our visual style, and using the model of a naked body in a completely non-sexualised way resonated with us a lot. It’s just like how we are using VAJ in a non-sexual way.How has starting out as VJs impacted how you approach DJing?We started FUSE as a space to experiment with visuals, but also do it to the music we love. Both creating visuals and DJing is interconnected for us, as both complement each other and create the whole atmosphere. It was much easier to grasp the logic behind mixing after we started VJing as it’s quite similar – both work with rhythm. We guess that’s how we approach both things – we see it as a whole experience. We recently did an AV show for Glasgow Film Festival and it was fun to see how music and visuals come together in a non-club space.When did you launch your club night FUSE?Our first night was in December 2016 as a student night on Thursdays. We could get the space in [Glasgow venue] The Art School for free as students and we wanted to take that opportunity to make the space our own, improve accessibility, and support womxn and gender non-conforming people in darker, 140 bass-driven genres. It's a scene which can be quite difficult to access for many reasons. We also wanted to incorporate live electronic sets within our night as well as visual arts – hence FUSE – merging together different things, sonically and visually.Glasgow is still predominantly known for techno. Have you come up against any challenges operating within such an environment?Pushing 140 in Glasgow is difficult! Bass genres are considered niche which is a shame, and therefore there isn’t much footfall for our nights. It has both advantages and downsides to it though. On the one hand, we know that our crowd comes to FUSE for the love of music, therefore there’s a good vibe and so much love always! We are genuinely so grateful for all the nice things we hear about our night. On the other hand, our demographic is quite limited, and it can be hard to reach a wider audience. But the thing is, those who are not familiar with the sound are enjoying it when they do come. It’s difficult to introduce people to anything new, but bass music and 140 genres are on the rise in Glasgow now and there are quite a few nights that push that sound, though we would imagine they face similar problems. A lot of big promoters who put on techno nights have a lot of resources that we unfortunately don’t have. This is a struggle, but also it’s very rewarding to see more people coming to the nights which work with not so commonly heard genres.FUSE incorporates workshops for aspiring animators, who can then showcase their work during the night. Why was this important to you?When we started FUSE, our goal was to showcase local lesser-known talent alongside some bigger names, which hopefully helps the artists out and gives them space for experimentation in a non-judgemental space. We basically applied the same logic to the visuals, as that was the space we could provide. We think sharing knowledge is very important, and very rewarding as well. When we started out, there were very few people who did visuals in Glasgow – we could probably count them on one hand. Now the visuals are a part of many nights, which is incredible. It gives people another artistic outlet and provides new experiences for the audience. It’s great to see such nights as Belly Tree and A Cut Above for example, who have a dedicated spot for the VJs, and make it integral to their nights.November 2018 saw you launch a booking agency for artists from Glasgow and beyond. Can you talk us through this transition?We thought that with the resources we have, however limited on the grand scheme of things, could still help artists out. The ethos behind our FUSE by VAJ.Power agency is to push for more professional and respectful communication between artists and promoters, as well as to try putting artists on the map outside of the ‘Glasgow bubble’. There’s so much talent that unfortunately goes unnoticed. We’ve also launched a FUSE by VAJ.Power mix series where we interview the artists who provide mixes for us, and the common thread is that artists don’t feel respected enough: they are not told the set times; their travel is not paid; they might not even be paid at all, and that’s what we wanted to tackle. We want artists to feel comfy and be able to turn up to the gig and give it one hundred percent without thinking of the logistics or feeling undervalued.Can you tell us a little bit about the artists on your roster?The diversity of genres is a big focus for us, as well as working with artists who aren’t afraid to take risks and stay true to themselves. That being said, we predominantly work with the artists who play bass-driven genres, such as dubstep, grime, UKG, hard drum, club music and so on. In Glasgow, and beyond too - for example we have Accra-based Keyzuz and Chicago’s 2 Centavos on our rosterWe also strive to work with queer artists, as being queer ourselves, we know that you have to fight for the respect in the scene and for the safer environments. For example, some artists require gender-neutral toilets, and it is important that promoters recognise and respect artists’ needs. These seemingly small things reflect the bigger picture in the music scene and improve attitudes and visibility. It’s important for us as agents to also recognise such problems within the scene as tokenism and misgendering – the amount of times we’ve been addressed as ‘female DJs’ or FUSE addressed as a ‘female-friendly night’. We want to take on the responsibility of communicating those issues and take the burden of it off artists’ shoulders.Another thing is, it’s not a secret that the bass scene is predominately white and cis male, with the same guys getting booked over and over (and over) again, taking up the space of less privileged people. Our roster proves that the bass community is just not that demographic at all. And at least in Glasgow, it’s not an option to go for the same obvious choice every time anymore, because here they are, all these great artists from different backgrounds, playing all sorts, fitting the line-ups perfectly.Can you talk us through your Impact mix?We really wanted to show our versatility with this mix. Our approach to mixing is almost telling a story musically. We love speeding up and slowing down, creating pauses, and then getting even more intense. We love working with darker vibes and textural sounds as well and we also use DJing as a tool to explore the music created by womxn and gender-nonconforming people in the bass community. Do send us your tracks on vaj.power.vj@gmail.com – we are soon to announce our new radio show and want to showcase great new music.We’ve included quite a few tracks that we never get to play in a club. Special shout out to London-based producer/DJ TAYYLOR MADE, Glasgow-based Italian producer 3SBAT, Khiva and Moscow’s Oddkut, whose tracks we played in the mix.

"Wonderful chaos courtesy of DJ Marcelle/Another Nice MessDJ Marcelle is that rare combination of things: fearless, innovative, uncategorisable and funny as fuck. She’s in that league of artists who are out there, doing their own thing, for the pure art and energy of it all.The Dutch DJ and producer has been honing her craft for a hot minute (translation: the best part of two decades) but has recently been blessing dancefloors for a new generation of fans – or perhaps disciples works better in Marcelle’s case – at en vogue parties like CTM, Sonic Acts, Atonal, Dekmantel and, later this summer, Dour, Primavera and Nachtdigital.Her sets (billed as DJ Marcelle/Another Nice Mess) cartwheel across the face of charged electronic music, with Marcelle diligently slapping vinyl down on three platters, drawing from her mammoth record collection (currently at upward of 20,000 discs) and longstanding experience in the rave and on the radio. She cuts between tempos and rhythms in a way that’ll leave you constantly wrongfooted but gagging for more – what’s next?! Where is she taking us?! How did we get here in the first place?! Don’t worry, Marcelle is always in full control of such wonderful chaos and, of course, her audience’s destiny.In the studio, Marcelle’s vibe is just as rugged and raw. Her latest album 'One Place For The First Time' lands in May via Jahmoni, boasting nine tracks of warped, fuggy but altogether boisterous techno-not-techno, with track titles that reference her attitude and politics (‘Respect My Snack Foods’, ‘Respect Caged Animals’ and ‘The Mother Of All Messes’, a Brexit headline) and psychedelic sleeve art that depicts a number of knitted hats and photographs, each a reference to a track on the LP and a colourful example of Marcelle’s keen sense of humour (her Facebook is also excellent).Indeed, Marcelle wears her heart on her sleeve at all times: she dismisses DJs who eschew lugging around heavy boxes of vinyl for lightweight USB sticks and calls out the mundanity of an underground circuit that has a tendency to repeat itself as often as its mainstream counterpart. And in fine style, she’s named her In Session the 'Mega Migmag Mig Mix', which was “as always done on/with three turntables, mixing, merging, manipulating and (ab)using loads and loads of vinyl – almost continuously three vinyls are playing at the same time.” This one turns DJ fuckboys into dust, offering a glimpse of Marcelle's arsenal and the unique way she deploys it. Watch out for four of her own productions in the mix too.'One Place For The First Time' is out in May via JahmoniSeb Wheeler is Mixmag's Head Of Digital.

"Justin Caruso is taking the electronic music world by storm as he continues to put out music and perform in a way that causes his fan base to steadily grow with each individual endeavor.More recently he announced several performances at some of the best music festivals to take place this season, as well as dropping new tracks and remixes alongside some of the biggest industry professionals. We had the chance to catch up with the artist during Miami Music Week after his set at the Spinnin’ Hotel to talk about musical collaborations, touring, and what’s next for Justin Caruso.How are you enjoying Miami Music Week so far?Loving it! It’s one of my favorite weeks. Being here is incredible, just running into friends and playing shows, its great!What was your favorite part of your set today?I have fun with Miami shows cause I can switch it up from my regular style. Like today I played a pool party so I was able to do a deep house set which is something I never really get to usually do. I had fun with that, making deep house edits of my own songs and such. Earlier this month you released a new track with 3LAU, “Better With You.” How was it working with 3LAU and what was the creative process like?It’s great working with 3LAU! He’s like a brother to me. He honestly gave me my first chance. We toured together 3 years ago and ever since then we just became best friends and working together has always been pretty natural since we were on the road together. As far as the creative process, I had the topline and the idea and I sent it over to him and he loved it. Then we were on tour together in Boston and we were in his hotel room and we just spent a couple of hours working on it and we just kind of knocked it out. It was great to finally have a song out together.You’re gearing up for some big festivals later this year, what are you most excited for with the coming festival season?I’m playing Chasing Summer, which I’m super excited about. I’ve always watched their livestreams and their videos so to be a part of it alongside some amazing artists is like a dream come true.I’ve been obsessed with your track through Ninjawerks, “If We Stay” featuring Ivy Adara since you released it. What was the experience like working on this project?That song is great! I’ve actually had that song in the works for like almost two to three years now. Emily Warren wrote the song and she sent me the idea a long time ago because I was a huge fan of hers. I remixed “Until You Were Gone'” by The Chainsmokers and she sang on it. Ever since then, we kind of stayed connected and she sent me this idea and I loved it. We worked on it but I never really had a chance to put it out so when the whole Ninjawerks project came forward they needed a song pretty quick and I had “If We Stay” like 80% done so I thought that was a perfect opportunity to finish it and get it out. You recently remixed Two Friends’ “With My Homies” and we love it! What made you want to remix this track?I love those two guys! We actually grew up together. We went to the same school and grew up in the same area. They sent me that song and asked me if I wanted to remix it and I said I was 100% in. I recently did a couple of shows with them as well, it was perfect timing and right after I finished the remix. You just finished touring with Tiesto at the end of 2018, how was that experience?That’s unreal. I still have to pinch myself. He’s the nicest guy I’ve ever met and so supportive. He always texts me and checks in on me, what I’m working on and how my shows are going. Touring with him was awesome. The crowds were incredible. Your “Best Day Ever” tribute for Mac Miller that you released earlier this year was so touching and special. As an artist, what made you want to create this tribute?I listened to Mac Miller growing up–I think most people did–so him passing away was kind of a hit on music and so many different things and I wanted to kind of find a way to pay tribute to his music since I enjoy it so much. I wanted to do a cover of it but I didn’t want to do anything too crazy. It’s kind of chill, and I just wanted to put it on SoundCloud for people to enjoy. I didn’t think it was fair to try to release on Spotify or try to make any money out of it. I wanted to do something special for him.What are your biggest plans for 2019 with your musical career?My biggest thing right now is trying to release as much music as possible. I’m finally at a point where I have so many songs done and I want to put them out to the world. I hope to release at least a song every month, maybe more than that. And I’m planning for a big fall tour coming up. I want to line up all my music and be ready for the tour. I’ve seen photos of your adorable dog Obi and I have to ask you to tell me a little bit about him!He’s a mini labradoodle. Being away from him is the worst but he’s the absolute best. Whenever I get back from tour, he’s patiently waiting for me. Having him has definitely changed my life. He comes to the studio with me and once he gets a little older I want to bring him on tour with me as well.  In honor of national pup day, shoutout to my best friend @obi_wan_kadoodle best thing thats ever happened to meA post shared by  Justin Caruso (@justincarusomusic) on Mar 23, 2019 at 11:06am PDTConnect with Justin Caruso: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloudYou Might Also Like

"If you told any local Aphex Twin fan that he was coming back to play a set after two decades, you would probably receive some curse words combined with an amiable “Get outta here.” Yet, it finally happened. Much has changed in the last two decades: there weren’t any Coachellas or Ultras, Enron was booming, and Donald Trump was making cameos on Home Alone 2. Regardless, Richard James, aka Aphex Twin, made an unforgettable stop to the bereaved and cynical fans in a Brooklyn warehouse last Thursday. He played at the Avant Gardner–a large warehouse that was converted to a venue space in Brooklyn that is as massive as it is impressive. With 90 minutes before the show started, the line to get in was already lengthy and seemingly endless as more and more fans gathered around the venue for a memorable night. The line was moving quickly and eventually broke up into people either going inside or standing in the merchandise line. Like the tickets, the shirts sold out in a matter of minutes. Photo by Zach DilgardThe first hour-and-a-half of the show was sans performer; a soundtrack of reggae, dub, and vocal samples from old-time British radio played gently through the columns of speakers. The display of lights at the Avant Gardner trickled a hazy purple like some nebula deep in space. The visual production team teased the crowd by quickly turning on the numerous LED panels before they went black again. Aïsha Devi took over and brought a special live set; both singing and playing tremendous, thundering bass in a Björk-like fashion. Another hour went by before Richard James started. The panels abruptly turned on and displayed the signature Aphex Twin logo. Soft ambient tunes rang out while the crowd started to grasp the brevity of the show and the madness that was about to ensue. It was difficult to actually see Richard. The decks were dark and his face was obscured by his laptop, like some faceless villain from an Orwell novel. While the ambient started to fade away, more head-bopping tunes followed before James played like an Apache warplane in the desert. He went through a paroxysm of sounds that glitched and rang in his legendary fashion. James transitioned from acid, techno, jungle, drum and bass and large breaks of sounds that were almost indescribable. Much of his set contained unreleased tracks.Photo by Zach DilgardThe crowd, in full shock and awe, savored every single second of his 90-minute set. They bursted out in laughter as the visual display grew weirder. A cameraman on his team recorded the first row of attendees whose faces were projected onto the LED screens. The faces were warped and peppered with psychedelia, so much so that their former identity was forever contorted, like the cover of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. James paid homage to New York by showcasing a visual display of cultural icons: Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, the crew of Seinfeld, and The Notorious B.I.G. Obviously, all the images were warped and flickered negative while a fleet of lasers blasted the Avant Gardner. Towards the end of the set, James went fully ballistic and played a showstopper that was both hazy and cognitively easy to grasp. It was as if you had a rave inside an industrial slaughterhouse. A jackhammer of drums assaulted the speakers, hi-hats rained blood, and bass pulsated violently before some clearly danceable drum and bass appeared.The set ended at 12:45 am. At a certain angle, you could almost see James wave and smile. 25 years of anticipation for a little bit over a 90-minute set. To say it was worth it, is an understatement. Conditions were about perfect in every capacity. If James doesn’t play New York City again until the year 2034, it will be worth it knowing he’ll deliver the same expectations to his dogged fans. Photo: @prolophotoOn April 10, NASA successfully took the first ever photo of a black hole. In more ways than none, Aphex Twin is similar to the cosmic phenomena. He absorbs sounds with such density, it makes the finished product so warped and distorted that its ends are as vague as its origins. Get too close, and you’ll be devoured. Connect with Aphex Twin: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloud                                                                 Photos by @zachdilgard / @prolophotoYou Might Also Like

"Few have left such a paramount mark to our music than the late Keith Flint of the Prodigy. The never mealymouthed singer helped bring The Prodigy to unfathomed heights with their album The Fat of the Land and the tour-de-force single, “Fire Starter.” An Essex local, Keith dropped out of school in his teens due to dyslexia and worked in roofing before he met The Prodigy. Originally a dancer for the band, Keith climbed the ladder and became their singer along with Maxim Reality. Throughout the 1990s, early aughts, and up to today, the band reached global attention, bringing all but their first album to the No. 1 spot in the UK and served as lynchpins for the US rave scene. Keith was nothing if not a performer. Littered with tattoos, pierced with metal, and hair of various colors, Keith served as a big middle finger to the mainstream zeitgeist of the time. Keith was refreshing, revered, and loathed all in equal measures. Simply put, he was our homespun hero. An anti-hero to popular culture, who embodied everything we wanted to hide because we didn’t think there was another person like us. Last month, Keith was found dead in his home in Essex. Coroners ruled his death as a suicide. We are still unsure about why Keith took his life at the age of 49. Liam Howlett, who formed the group in 1990, wrote on Instagram: “I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend. I’m shell shocked, fuckin angry, confused and heartbroken ….. r.i.p brother Liam.”Electronic music is hard. The hours of performing and producing can be fraught with loneliness and addiction. Traveling accompanies insomnia and depression. Keith Flint is not the only example of a startling trend in our electronic milieux. The wounds that were inflicted by the suicide of Avicii are still fresh. The death of Keith is one more deep cut that may not ever heal. While Keith would probably want to be remembered as a polymath for music and the weird, there is one more way to immortalize him.Noiseporn will be conducting a series of interviews with artists and music industry professionals to discuss mental health–specifically, how they cope with all the pressures and temptations that harbor our culture. This is not solely an issue for electronic music, it is ubiquitous for all performers. We hope these interviews will help the growing number of performers entering the scene to show that no one is alone.  Suicide prevention hotline (available 24 hours every day): 1-800-273-8255Swedish house and techno DJ La Fleur speaks to Noiseporn to talk about mental health in the industry.Do you think there are aspects specific to this industry that create depression or stress? Yes, the lack of sleep every weekend or while you are on tour is tremendously bad for your health coupled with the irregular time schedules and lack of a basic routine. Sometimes it’s hard to find time to connect with the people you really care about due to different time schedules and the fact that you are mostly away during the weekends, which is when most people are free to meet and catch up.Have you experienced depression or any low moments in your career or with those you’ve worked closely with?Yes, both, to be honest. I don’t know many people that have an extensive touring schedule – and are over the age of 25 – that haven’t had at least some low moments. My personal low moments have been caused by stress, lack of sleep, and work overload. I have learned to listen to my body more carefully and to prioritize better what needs to be done which helps a lot.How do you cope with the long hours of touring, loneliness, and staying overall mentally fit? I try to sleep when I can, I make this a priority when I’m on tour. I also meditate, stay hydrated as much as possible, and I try to fit in some light exercise. As well as eating as healthy as possible. I’m also in touch regularly with my loved ones on chat, call, and video.However, I will still feel tired and fragile when coming home from a long tour, it’s hard to avoid. My best antidote for that is during the time I do spend at home, I really try to stick to my normal routine. Having a four-year-old daughter makes it easier in many ways. I try to follow her schedule, early to bed and wake early in the morning, fixed meal times, and a lot of laughs!How does being a mother in the industry comes with its own unique set of challenges and stressors? How do you balance a career that involves so much traveling with parenthood? It has taken me quite some work and time to deal with feelings of guilt for leaving her and of course I sometimes still feel them, but those feelings are also a part of parenthood. You always want the best for your child and strive to make the best childhood for them. After having my daughter I got more selective with my gigs, I want it to be worth it being away from her. I want it to contribute to my growth as well as hers. I also plan weekends off in advance. A good thing is that I am very flexible during the week, and I think I get to spend more time with my daughter compared to most parents working a nine-to-five job. I’m thankful for that and I try to make the most of it. Then, last but not least, the support structure where my partner, her father, plays a vital role. He is at home with her during the weekends when I am away, without him I wouldn’t be able to do it.Nastia recently posted on Instagram about the years of unhealthy comparisons between her and Nina Kraviz that were based mainly on their looks. This wore her down and their friendship eventually deteriorated. Do you feel that women in music are more subjected to these comparisons than their male counterparts?Women have been much more objectified in our society than men which can lead to women feeling the pressure and expectation of looking a certain way. Society is also feeding a behaviour that cares too much about the outside world. I think both men and women are affected by this and are comparing themselves to others much more than it’s healthy to do so. A lot of people portray this happy, fun, picture perfect life on social media that isn’t necessarily true. If you’re not feeling great, does playing a set help? Always or just sometimes? If so, what’s the difference?It can definitely help! You can get a lot of love and energy from the crowd that can have a very positive effect on your mindset. Those moments are also the ones you’re chasing, the connection with the crowd, sharing a special moment. What does “community” mean to you in this industry?For me it means, ‘sharing is caring’, both the good and the bad. And being able to have some real conversations between people in the industry, and to care for each other. Connect with La Fleur: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloudYou Might Also Like

"Billboard Dance‘s Number 100 artist pick for 2019, Bob Moses, unleashed visuals for their electronica/downtempo delight “Enough to Believe” off the twosome’s 11-track body of work—2018’s Battle Lines. Matilda Finn, 2017’s UKMVA Best New Director, directed the “Enough to Believe” music video. Finn’s visual vita includes Bipolar Sunshine’s “Easy To Do,” Danny Brown’s “Lost” as well as Jay Rock’s “For What It’s Worth.”“Life’s struggles come in ebbs and flows, and when I listen to this track it made me think of ‘the hero’s journey’,” said Finn. “This is the concept that is used for narrative storytelling; it’s based on the theory that in life itself you are faced with numerous cycles of challenges: you can either choose to take these challenges on and evolve or you can ignore them.”Eyeball Bob Moses’ music video for “Enough to Believe” below.

"Swiss songsmith and Quartz Records boss lady Sensu published future bass lullaby “Listen” (ft. Otis Junior), the first track off her awaited debut LP Embrace, on Quartz Records/Universal. Jasmin Peterhans, aka Sensu, employs an unconventional production method that has led her to one unforgettable musical M.O.:“After building a melodic progression from a simple chord and fleshing out the high end of each arrangement, I incorporate vocal samples and bass lines,” said Peterhans. “Only when the rest of these pieces are in place, do I underscore them with a drum pattern. Instead of programming each one, I play it on a drum pad to make sure the heartbeat of the track exudes as much of a human element as possible.”Stay tuned for Embrace’s Sept. 6 release. Watch the music video for Sensu’s “Listen” (ft.

He closes out the collection with softer sounds that shine through on “OM NAMO” featuring Sarah Hudson and “ACE OF CUPS,” which brings the ’90s vibes full circle.“Renegades of Light!

"With a monumental album release now finally out, we just had to catch up with metal/bass maestro PhaseOne. The Australian DJ/producer has poured his heart and soul into the unbelievably good Transcendency LP, and we’re thoroughly enjoying every part of it.We chatted about the album with PhaseOne and got to know a little bit more about the creative process in this exclusive Behind The Bass.Thanks for joining us! How are you feeling now that your album is finally ready for everyone to hear?No worries! It’s a mixed bag of emotions for sure! I’m so excited that it’s finally reaching people’s ears, but I’ve been so nervous at the same time because I put almost a year of work into it – and all my blood, sweat and tears.You’ve been in the game for some time, but how long exactly have you been making music for?The PhaseOne project turns 8 this year, but I’ve been creating music of all sorts since I was a kid (not EDM). I’ve been playing guitar and piano since I was five-ish, and started messing with production when I was 13, just making hip-hop beats. Then I got heavily into metal and rekindled my love for guitar. I played in about 5 different bands throughout my teens and into my 20’s. I also went to college and studied audio engineering and began recording and producing all my bands’ and friend’s bands’ albums. But then I head dubstep in 2010-11 and I immediately had to try experimenting with it, because it was this whole new side of audio engineering I had never known about before. It took me many years to find a sound I wanted to call my own, but 8 years on and it’s now my full-time job.What/who/where inspires you the most creatively?Nothing really in particular, I just constantly go through waves of creative bursts, I’ll not touch Ableton for a month and not feel inspired, then I’ll have a month where I don’t leave my computer, haha. But often if I feel some writer’s block I just pick up my guitar and mess around with some chord progressions or melody ideas.What are your favorite parts about being an artist? If you could change one thing about it, what would it be?I’ve always loved travelling, even before I was a touring DJ I’d travelled a lot of the world, but now I get to do it and get paid (haha) – although it can be quite tiring, especially when you’re doing 3-5 shows a week and lots of international travel. But until teleportation is invented, it’s just part of the job.How long ago did you start working Transcendency? What was the initial creative drive behind it?It was a collective decision between myself, my manager and the Disciple team to do the ‘Transcendency’ album. Basically, we wanted to show what I am truly capable of in my productions and also pay respects to my roots as a musician. We figured the best way to achieve this was to do a full-length album which would give me the opportunity to branch out and experiment beyond the typical 4-track dubstep EP. I was nervous at first because I knew this would require a huge amount of time; it took me almost a year, and I was worried people would forget about me (lol) if I wasn’t constantly putting music out! However, I’m so glad I did the album, and I’m stoked with what I’ve created and it’s already turning so many heads. Hopefully, it was worth the wait!Out of all of the tracks, do you have a particular favorite?If someone was to ask what does PhaseOne sound like, I’d probably show them “Crash & Burn,” I think that track as a whole best describes what I’m about in one song. It has a nice melodic intro, a big metal build mixed with wobbly bass sounds, a huge dubstep drop, a metal breakdown and a melodic yet heavy chorus section. Northlane also happens to be one of my favourite bands, so it was a real honour to be able to work with them on this.I also want to mention “Digital” with Periphery, another song I’m excited about, for the same reasons but also because it’s a different style/tempo to the normal PhaseOne sound, so for me, it’s super exciting to experiment with something and have it turn out so well. Which song took the longest to make from start to finish?In terms of when I started it to when I finished it, probably “Ultima.” It went through lots of different versions and makeovers before it became what it is today. Originally it was just going to be an instrumental and there were a few different versions of that before I thought it was finished, but then the Bone Thugs feature came through and I had to restructure once again and add a verse for the vocals. So overall that took the longest because I had to keep coming back to it but I’m stoked with how it came out!If you could collaborate with any artist on earth, whom would you choose and why?Freddie Mercury. Like most people my age, I grew up on Queen and he’s just one of the greats that will always have a close place in my heart.Which direction do you want to take over the next year? Any plans you can share with us?I just plan on touring a lot off the back of this album and also write a follow-up EP, which I’m nervous about because it has to live up to ‘Transcendency,’ haha.See all of PhaseOne’s upcoming tour dates here.Connect with PhaseOne: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloud The AuthorYou Might Also Like

"Ultra Music Festival just finished up its 21st year in operation–possibly the biggest year yet for the mega-festival. With about 170,000 attendees from a little over 100 countries and an innumerable amount of once-in-a-lifetime performances, Ultra boasted an incredible weekend of entertainment for everyone involved at their new location in Virginia Key, Florida.Each night, the closing acts of main stage–Marshmello, Martin Garrix, and The Chainsmokers–absolutely annihilated festivalgoers with the most hype tunes matched with the newest and best production elements creating a scene like no other. Deadmau5 unveiled his brand new Cube 3.0, which, despite encountering small complications at the beginning of the set, ended up being one of the most impressive displays of technology in electronic music to date.The live stage hosted an unmatchable lineup of in-the-moment talent, most notably presenting the GRiZ live band in accompaniment with the University of Miami drumline as well as Gigantic NGHTMRE presenting a fantastic collaboration of bass, trap and funk.UltraArguably the most impressive part of the new locale was the addition of Resistance Island, a literal techno getaway where one could either lay and rock in hammocks with a tropical cocktail or pop off into a full-on shuffle at the Carl Cox Mega Structure.UltraUltra put in all the efforts possible to make sure their impact on the wildlife of Virginia Key was as low as could be with their newest venture, Mission: Home. With this initiative, Ultra wanted to make sure trash and litter was kept at a minimum and that the natural environments surrounding the festival went uninterrupted.UltraOn the first night of the festival, Ultra unfortunately experienced a few hours of general confusion surrounding transportation for attendees, but they made a full recovery the rest of the weekend and overall entertained an almost flawless first year at the new location.Ultra Music Festival will return for their 22nd journey on March 27-29, 2020, and it will be fascinating to see what the country’s largest electronic event has planned for their next edition.You Might Also Like

"Canada native Dabin is taking the electronic world by storm with his unique endeavor to create a sanctuary within his musical creations. The producer is currently on his debut headlining tour and just released his sophomore album, Wild Youth, so he is keeping himself very busy as he expands his touch amongst the industry. We recently had a chance to catch up with Dabin after his set at BUKU Music + Art Project in New Orleans. Check it out below:We loved your set tonight! What was your favorite part of performing at BUKU?Just being here at Buku, I love this festival! I was here last year with Illenium and I didn’t get to experience it as much, so it was cool to come back and experience it for a second time. What initially inspired you to start producing music?I was playing guitar much longer than I was producing and when I went off to University, the friends I made in first year were all super into electronic music and I started thinking that it could be something that I’d be interested in as well. That was my first entrance into electronic. We heard your Coachella set was amazing. How was it playing to that crowd?It might’ve been the biggest crowd I’ve ever played. It was super fun and hopefully I’ll be back!We love your new track, “Another Day” feat. Nevve. WWhat was the creative process like with this song?That song was actually with Inukshuk–he was the other collaborator and that was the first song that was finished on the album, we just had no vocals for it. We were just shopping for vocals for so long. I’m super particular when it comes to finding the right melody and tonality of the voice so it was literally up until the week before the album was due and we had no vocals. Then I was talking to Illenium and asking him if he had any ideas of who could do the vocals quick and really good and he said you should hit up Nevve! Literally the first thing she sent back is now the track. Your newest album, Wild Youth, just came out! Can you tell us a little bit about this project?It’s been a year in the making and I’m so excited that it’s finally out. I can’t wait to hear the feedback from it. You just spent time touring with Illenium and are now are embarking on your own debut tour. What are you most excited for with this upcoming experience?Just to put people into my musical world and not really cater to anyone else. To be like, this is the music that I’m making and these are my visuals and just put on a 100% authentic Dabin experience. Make sure to catch Dabin on The Wild Youth Tour until April 27th, and check out his brand new album, out now on all platforms.Connect with Dabin: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloudYou Might Also Like

"Hekler is an artist who has seemed to blow up almost out of nowhere. From his massive remix of Herobust’s “WTF” to his most recent collabs with YOOKiE and Mastodon, it seems that the only way is up for this young newcomer. With his new single “Doom,” that progression isn’t stopping any time soon.“Doom” sees the Vegas-born producer teaming up with fellow dubstep rising star Calcium for a beast of a song. The track kicks off with a trap beat before a satisfyingly creepy vocal sample brings us into a straight-up neck-breaking drop. Combined with the nasty saws and bass waves, the whole thing feels like we’ve just walked into a warped version of Halloween.“Doom” is the first single from Hekler’s long-awaited debut EP, What the Hek, due out later this month. This year is looking to be one of the best yet in a long line of successes since debuting in 2017.

I started the track the day of my last show in the morning. The track was super incomplete but had a dope vibe to it so I played it out that night. The next couple of days I started to dislike the lead and the track took a complete turn. I’ve been incorporating my new toy The Moog Grandmother in a bunch of tunes lately and I layed down a thick baseline. I’ve been doing a lot of work with Sam from bd hbt recently and I was super inspired by his wub work so I added some crazy wubz. The track took a crazy turn at that point. I finessed a vocal in there and started going crazy on FX automation and resampling.

"As a warm-up to their fourth artist album, The Young Punx released their new single ‘Wonderland’ via the superb MofoHifi Records.‘Wonderland’ is a radical deconstruction of the 80s classic ‘Club Tropicana’ to the effect that you might not even recognise it. The Wham! classic is spliced, turned upside-down and inside-out and re-imagined in almost unrecognisable form as a pulsing talkbox driven, ItaloDisco anthem.Grammy Nominated UK multi-instrumentalist and record producer Hal Ritson, who has credits on over 1000 records, including for artists like Katy Perry, Cassius, The Prodigy, Kanye West, Nas, Black Eyed Peas, Duke Dumont, Avicii, David Guetta, Chemical Brothers and many more is the brains behind the track.Talking about the single, Hal says “Though The Young Punx have always loved to combine the widest possible range of sounds and influences, our biggest love has always been the use of 80s pop culture references. Our first ever bootleg in 2003 was the Madonna sampling ‘Dance with someone else’ – which was championed by everyone from BBC Radio 1’s Judge Jules and Annie Nightingale to Mixmag and foreshadowed the 80s-sampling ‘Call On Me’ era dance craze that followed. As we warm up for our 4th album, it’s great to have a chance to turn an 80s classic on its head once again.”We are massive fans of what they’ve done to the original, their italodisco relick has packed a big track with 2019 summer vibes, I want to head to the beach /pool party right away after hearing it!This is gonna be big this summer!",articles34,"['The Young Punx', 'Hal Ritson', 'Katy Perry', 'Cassius', 'The Prodigy', 'Kanye West', 'Nas', 'Black Eyed Peas', 'Duke Dumont', 'Avicii', 'David Guetta', 'Chemical Brothers', 'The Young Punx']"

"In early 2018, Jas Shaw, one half of Simian Mobile Disco was diagnosed with a rare health condition – AL Amyloidosis – a disorder of bone marrow cells.Having just completed SMD’s 7th studio album Murmurations and with a special show at the Barbican scheduled for April, things were thrown into confusion.  At the time, no one, including Shaw, knew how the prognosis would pan out. Jas had to start chemotherapy almost immediately, which meant cancelling the tour. The duo decided to go ahead with the Barbican show in spite of Shaw’s illness, which was especially poignant as all involved knew it could potentially be SMD’s last ever live performance – in the end, it turned out to be a tour-de-force. If this was SMD’s swansong, so be it.In the year that followed, Jas spent months receiving weekly chemotherapy, learning to live with his condition, and when he felt well enough, spending hours in his studio making music.The result of this was twofold, firstly a collaborative album with Derwin Dicker (Gold Panda) and secondly, a growing archive of solo work, which is now ready for release. Entitled “The Exquisite Cops”, this 20+ track growing body of work will see the light of day via SMD’s Delicacies label – with a 2-track single released every fortnight /month and a limited edition double LP scheduled for the fall.Jas: “The Exquisite Cops tracks seem to have made their own system for creation. Normally I record electronic music like a band would, as a take. So, it’s kind of surprising to me that that this batch of tracks wasn’t made this way. Instead of a single take that gets edited and developed these tracks were all made in bits, usually months apart. Some days I’d make a drum track, often editing it down so that it’s some sort of semblance of a structure; on other days I’d end up just making a synth sound or texture. This wasn’t something that I gave into reluctantly, it’s nice to be able to give a feedback based pad your whole attention rather than just set it up and only attend to it if it gets really out of hand.The process of matching these misfits together was originally born out of laziness, rather than break open the synths to make something to develop an idea, what if I could just use something that I already had; slack. The interesting thing was that in pulling two takes together that were done months apart, they cast each other in a different light and though sometimes making them fit together was a hatchet job, sometimes they locked up together in an improbable way, making the rough structures that I’d improvised make a different sort of sense; often a more interesting sort of sense. The more I did this the more it felt like this was not just a slacker’s way to use up offcuts, this resulted in combinations that I’d probably not have chosen if I’d done the tracks in one go. Also, and I know this isn’t something that’s important to everyone, there was a level of fastidious detail that I’d never have got if I’d had the textural and rhythmic elements playing together. It’s a longwinded process but it’s changed how I record and how I think about recordings I’ve made; plus I enjoy all parts of it so why cut it short?”",articles34,"['SMD’s', 'Shaw', 'Barbican', 'Shaw’s', 'SMD’s', 'SMD’s']"

It’s a highly accomplished record which looks set to push this talented artist into higher reaches still. Some of the tracks began life over a decade ago and have been allowed to marinate, mature and evolve in an unhurried fashion. It’s more than just a collection of tracks, but a body of work that serves as a diary of his last decade-and-a-half. “I have been working on this album one way or another for nearly ten years now,” says the producer. “Lots of the tracks in it are based on rough sketches or half-finished ideas from years ago, which up until now I was not able to produce and finish as I had envisioned them. In this way, it’s a kind of musical diary for me that charts different periods in my life.”BUY LINK – https://www.beatport.com/release/church-of-clubmusic/2551759",articles34,['It’s']

He says: Named after Hawaii’s most active volcano, ‘Kilauea’ cleverly evokes images of exotic island scenery using ukulele and lap steel guitar samples alongside the sound of island birds and crashing surf.

This refers to the sounds of his techno album, but with “sensitive” melodies and harmonies.I imagined a couple evolve in a very cold, very hard context (The filming took place in Estonia in the middle of winter). The idea was to have them in this context, in abandoned places, reminiscent of a complicated historical period. I wanted to make the characters evolve , from urban landscapes to nature, with dance as the only way to free themselves.

"DSP releases his ‘Destination EP’ on Symmetry Recordings on Friday 26th April. Since receiving an amazing amount of support from the drum & bass world’s biggest names, DSP has continued to draw on his junglist roots. This has led him to make the type of dnb which he’s become known for. His personal influences range over a variety of styles, merging both the lighter and darker sides of the genre which he’s dedicated his life to. Headed up by Break, one of the most sought-after artists in drum & bass, Symmetry Recordings is the perfect home for DSP’s productions.The vibe throughout his ‘Destination EP’ was planted by the positive feedback his last single ‘Unruly’ and ‘These Days’ on Symmetry received. The original aim was to bring the old school, jungle feels to his sound, updating this with the contemporary studio techniques also used for other types of music. This is one of the key reasons why Break brought him into the Symmetry family. After such high praise for his previous release on the label, it was time for the producer to make the most of the decades he’s spent committed to drum & bass.We premiere the title-track of the EP ‘Destination’ which is a testament to DSP’s old skool roots, rolling through with patches of cascading drum beats and jungle-esque samples.Check it out below and grab a copy from here",articles34,"['Break', 'Symmetry', 'Days’', 'Symmetry', 'Break', 'Symmetry']"

"MYKOOL began in 2012 when his flickering interest in music production rose into a burning passion that continues to spread.Initially, before MYKOOL got into making his own music he was content with recreating soundtracks from his favourite games and TV shows. He then began listening to the heavier side of Drum & Bass, aspiring to artists like Mediks. He still has great influences from his favourite producer Metrik which can be heard throughout his music.One of MYKOOL’s proudest moments was back in September 2017 where he had the chance to play at Hospitality In The Park in the Cuckoo’s Nest where he battled another DJ for 1st place – the ultimate test of his mixing skills.After a succession of impressive releases, free downloads and remixes, MYKOOL presents his debut Nu Venture Records release ‘Feel Alive’ // ‘Makes Me Wonder’. We premiere ‘Feel Alive’ which begins with a dreamy intro, laden with alluring atmospheric pads, setting the tone for this uplifting dance floor Drum & Bass track. The emotional and catchy vocals combined with a ‘Heartbeat’ sample, further enhance the sound and really help bring the track to life and create an audible state of ecstasy.

"Amazon has entered into discussions to launch a free, ad-supported music service.  The world’s biggest e-retailer would market the free music service through its voice-activated Echo speakers, sources say, and would offer a limited catalogue. It could become available as early as next week.Until now, Amazon has offered its limited Prime Music service as a way to drive Prime subscriptions, which cost $119 a year for perks like free delivery. It also sells Amazon Music Unlimited subscriptions separately for $9.99 a month, reducing the fee to $7.99 for Prime members and $3.99 a month for people who only listen on an Echo device.The arrival of the ad-supported service promises to boost Amazon’s presence as a major player in the music streaming market. It will create a new freemium ‘funnel’ for millions of customers, whom Jeff Bezos’s company can then target with an up-sell into Amazon Music Unlimited – the firm’s paid-for, on-demand premium streaming platform.This could massively change the streaming market, Amazon is the biggest company in the world with the biggest user base and could cause massive problems for Spotify in the ‘Voice’ Market.Users will be able to ‘ask’ Alexa to shuffle songs by specific artists, we’re told, but will not be able to ask directly for specific tracks on demand. Amazon will be running advertising within the new free service, which is likely to include first-party marketing both for Amazon Prime and Amazon Music Unlimited.One major label insider said: “This is a very exciting development.

"Point Blank are back with Ski Oakenfull for an extra special deconstruction of Adamski’s huge 90s hit, ‘Killer’, featuring soul-sensation, Seal. This PB deconstruction is particularly special as they were joined by Adamski himself to answer some questions about his processes, how he hooked up with Seal for the track and his career before delving into the magic behind his anthemic ‘Killer’. In case you don’t know, Ski is the Head of Curriculum at Point Blank so whether you study with them in London or Online (or elsewhere) he will have a major hand in what you learn at the school.The Adamski-produced
‘Killer’ was released back in 1990 and fuses influences from acid house and
soul with plenty of dancey vibes mixed in. What started off as an instrumental
to be included in the UK-producer, DJ and singer’s live sets soon became a
legendary earworm that’s racked up millions of plays to date. The track was
created using the iconic Roland TR-909 as well as the Ensoniq SQ 80 synth
and a Yamaha RX120 Drum Machine (some pieces of gear Ski goes into more detail
about in the video) and featured on Adamski’s Doctor Adamski’s Musical
Pharmacy, which was released by major label, MCA.For the
deconstruction, Ski fires up Ableton Live 10.1 with his trusty Push 2 and
loads up Ableton’s stock 909 kit. He punches in the beat starting with kicks,
claps, rim shots and hats before breaking for an exclusive interview
with the man behind the track. Picking things back up, Ski keys in the
iconic bassline revealing a plugin he found which emulates the distinct sound
perfectly. He plays in the emotional chords for ‘Killer’ shedding some light on
the music theory behind the track then gets to work on the rave piano and bell

"It will be an autobiographic release.
DJ and producer Yousef has announced his fourth studio album, ‘9 Moor Drive’, named like this in honor of his family home in Liverpool. With this LP the artist opens the door to his turbulent and often uncertain childhood through music. It is a material that, according to the press of the artist, will take the listeners to a trip through a difficult period of ten years that he lived there, since he was four to fourteen years.
“9 Moor Drive is autobiographical, but it isn’t a bleeding-heart story about hard times or anguish. It’s about dealing with life’s difficulties, exploring creativity and reminiscing about my life’s defining moments. It is the final piece in a long cathartic process about those times”, Yousef commented.
On the first single ‘Riches To Rags’,  he points directly to the financial decline his family had on this period. Then we could say it is the first piece of the wider puzzle that defines a long and cathartic healing process.
‘9 Moor Drive’ will be available August 16th via Circus Recordings. You can preorder your copy here.

Forget about the day of rest because legendary East London club night Savage Disco will take over Printworks on April 14th with a plethora of DJs, dancers and performers for the Sunday Service party.
East Creative, the team behind it have put on some of the UK’s biggest LGBTQ+ inclusive events such as Sink The Pink and Mighty Hoopla. They will transform the 5,000-capacity venue into a temple that will be their biggest gathering to date.
You will get to worship at the feet of house icons Kenny Dope, Todd Terry and Luke Solomon, as well as the club’s residents. The service will also welcome House Gospel Choir to the line-up; a powerful group of singers who will bring a euphoric and spiritual vibe to the proceedings.  Couple all this with elaborate set design, troops of dancers and interactive activities. Guests will also be invited to sing along to classic vocal house tracks with hymn sheets just in case it wasn’t all holy enough.
“We started Savage as London’s LGBTQ+ community needed a weekly home; it was inclusive and built on hedonism and fun. We can’t wait to take the spirit of Savage to a much bigger stage and show those that have never been before what we are all about” says Head of the Savage Maxi More.

After two years of studio sessions, Enzo Siragusa has announced ‘A Decade of Rave’, his first full-length album. The LP will be published on his own imprint FUSE.
The ten track album is inspired by the sound that influenced the artist during the 90’s and it’s aligned to the style that characterizes the London events, led by him, that already accomplished 10 years on the scene.
“My love for London’s most fertile period of rave culture in the ‘90s is the heart of FUSE. Starting at our original home of 93 Feet East where we revived a sense of how incredible clubbing was back then”, Siragusa commented. “Over the last decade myself and the party residents have nurtured this melting pot of influences that we experienced in the London scene and poured it into our party and the music we make. The label is ultimately a reflection, it’s the music that feeds our dance floor and is the distinct identity we’ve worked hard to cultivate.”
The release will be available April 26th, supported with a series of live shows including Europe, North and South America dates.

"Monstercat wonderboy Gammer joined Point Blank to breakdown his epic club track, ‘Out With The Old’. The “spiritual follow-up” to his previous hit, ‘The Drop’, continues to embrace the producer and DJ’s trance roots and packs one hell of a punch. Crammed with euphoric strings, heavy-weight bass lines, screeching melodies and more, it’s everything you could want from a Gammer track. ‘Out With The Old’ is available now via DJ Snake’s new Premiere Classe imprint and continues the producer’s winning streak.
In the video watch Gammer and DJ Ravine get into the thick of what went into the track and don’t forget, you can learn about all of the techniques demonstrated here with Point Blank’s production classes in London.
Kicking off the breakdown the UK producer delves into the emotive strings and vocoder synth used in the track’s intro – including the plugins he added to achieve such a rich and luscious sound. Before breaking down the drop he unveils his buildup techniques and where he layered a number of simple synths and effects to create maximum rave levels. He then goes on show the techniques behind his drop. To create this monster Gammer used his go-to bass synth paired with an underlying vocal sample manipulated beyond belief with Ableton’s vocoder.

"Over the last few years, Instagram has made an enormous impact on social media. Now, Instagram could be adding a new feature where the app will hide the amount of likes users receive on their photos.Instagram described this change as a massive potential impact on users’ mental health. Although social media can be all fun and games, sometimes social media apps can unfortunately get competitive. Instagram wants to end the hostile and competitive attitude on their application. Despite the fact that consumers enjoy getting new likes on their photos, Instagram’s goal is to reduce pressure and make Instagram a safe place for users to share content.“We want your followers to focus on what you share, not how many likes your posts get. During this test, only the person who shares a post will see the total number of likes it gets.”Instagram explains how removing like counts has the ability to reduce negative feedback while using the app. While Instagram has been simultaneously been going back and forth about what the future holds for social media, this change might be the next big thing for the next generation. Being aesthetic has always been a big trait for Instagram users. Now, Instagram is looking into creating ways for users to show their true creativity.Although Instagram is proposing a change that will be out of the ordinary, how will this impact Instagram Influencers?

It begs the question: what will they do with that space during the winter? Even the city had initial concerns about adding a pool to the historical downtown area.

They were one of the top acts booked for Woodstock 50. They said it was mostly due to a “Scheduling conflict” but who knows.The second and most recent red flag was their official ticket sale being pushed back to an undisclosed date. Billboard reported that the original date was scheduled for April 22 but “There is currently a hold on the Woodstock 50 on-sale date.” Woodstock’s talent staff actually sent an email out to all artist agents making them aware of the situation.“There is currently a hold on the Woodstock 50 on-sale date. We are waiting on an official press statement from Woodstock 50 regarding updated announce, ticket pricing, and overall festival information. We will get this information to you as soon as we receive it.”Michael Lang, the original Woodstock co-founder, has denied all these rumors of cancellation. Although he brushed off the rumors he did not provide a reason for ticket sales being pushed back. The festival is set to take place the exact dates of the original, August 16-18, at Watkins Glen International Speedway. Which is 120 miles away from the original location of Bethel Woods.Lang is still pumping people up saying the festival will be a “once in a lifetime event.” However, one agent did say “No one knows what the hell is going on but there is clearly a problem.” So we really don’t know what to believe.Let’s just hope Woodstock 50 can fix its early problems.

Starting at a gay club where was directed to play new wave music along with the other funk and dance records he used, Guetta states that this seed has guided his entire music career of electronic DJing and production.He accidentally discovered house music by looking around at what other gay clubs in the world were doing, especially America, and discovered house music. He opened a club called ‘Queen’ in 1992 in Paris, where he was the art director and main DJ. He started bringing in American DJs every Friday like David Morales, Frankie Knuckles, Danny Tenaglia, Masters at Work and DJ Pierre to not only bring house music to France, but learn from the house pioneers and hone his own craft. From this arrangement he was acquainted with Robert Owens and created his first record ‘Up and Away’. This notoriety led to him being discovered by the owner of Space in Ibiza. One showing, he was actually filmed played at Space which was incredible for him.On his record , Guetta ran into Thomas from Daft Punk at a club and ended up going to Daft Punk’s studio to play his record. He had believed Daft Punk’s success came from having a giant studio and quickly realized their studio was even smaller than his own, and their music was so good because they were just better. This meeting led to Daft Punk calling Virgin Records to report they had a friend (Guetta) who had produced a really good record, and he was signed immediately and his production career took off.Guetta notes in the last few years he stopped being a DJ and just became an artist, making shows for people who come to see a concert. It’s a different job than DJing, and he misses the freedom of playing something else. The Jack Back project is a way for him to get back to the nostalgic sounds he used to play at after-parties in Ibiza and Miami, just “grooves for hours”. Having to deliver hits has been making him miserable, he wants to bring back emotion and risk to his DJ game. His first Jack Back show he was finally nervous to perform again, which is one of the best feelings.“David Guetta, I’m a Warner artist. Everything I do I have to ask for permission.

Unfortunately, the site crashed almost instantly, leaving fans in anguish. Many complained about numerous technical glitches and site crashes as soon as they tried to hit “purchase.”Burning Man apologized for the incident on their blog. In previous years they had used Ticketfly and most things worked fine. This year, they switched companies. This company was kept mysterious at the start of these issues, and only named days after the incident. ShowClix has now been identified as the company that contributed to this disaster.Insiders told Billboardthat Burning Man is one of the most technically complicated ticketing events in the industry. It was clearly too complicated for ShowClix. The event used a multi-tiered registration system that will actually filter out people who don’t share their values. This being their principles of gifting, communalism, and participation.Ticket scalpers have longed tried to infiltrate their system. Burning Man actually banned some automated software that allows them to jump in front of the line. One Burning Man Blog had a few thoughts on the whole issue:“Even if it had gone perfectly from a technical perspective, the vast majority of those participating would not have been able to purchase a ticket as demand significantly outstripped supply.”Next year you can either expect Burning Man to have a new ticketing service or a completely updated one – hopefully.",articles11,"['Burning Man', 'Burning Man', 'Burning Man']"

They created a special 360-degree short film for their song ‘Underwater’.The film is nearly indescribable. First, they bring you into this frigid expansive space. There are low-seated inflatable chairs all around the space, situated just right so that we can see the ceiling. There is no bad seat – however, it was hard to know that, since we had no idea what to expect.They have us sit, and all goes dark. It begins simply with a beam of light to draw our eye. Then the music begins. ‘Underwater’ itself is a beautiful song. And the visuals that Frost and his team created to go with it were perfect.Colors and shapes. Movement. It all felt like traveling through the cosmos, while at the same time, traveling through human consciousness. The film wasn’t 3D, but the way it was created and projected onto the dome made it feel like it was. Beyond 3D, really.Prior to the opening of the festival, there was a small launch party for the film. Rufus Du Sol performed a small, intimate DJ set in Coachella’s HP Lounge. They also participated in a panel discussion about the film and the technology behind it.This was the first time the group was able to see the film as well. They had seen bits pieces throughout the process, but never the finished product.It’s one of those experiences where you really had to be there to get it.

It’s been two years since the infamous disaster that was Fyre Festival. Earlier this year, both Hulu and Netflix released documentaries about the event. The documentaries were a bit different, but both detailed what went wrong. And they also included exclusive footage of co-founder, Billy McFarland. This footage is now under question.The Chapter 7 (or Bankruptcy) Trustee for the Fyre Festival Estate, Gregory Messer, wants to know how the streaming companies got this footage. More importantly, they want to know how much they paid for it. It’s already known that Hulu paid McFarland for the footage they used, but it’s unsure just how much, or what happened to the money.Messer is requesting for a New York Bankruptcy judge to allow him to subpoena Netflix and Hulu. He states that they need to know where the footage came, as it may have been an asset of Fyre Festival LLC. This money could be used to generate money for the company’s creditors.“Due to a lack of information, it is impossible for the Trustee to determine where the footage came from and whether such footage was an asset of the Debtor’s estate,” Messer said in his filing.There has been no comment so far from either Netflix or Hulu.",articles11,"['It’s', 'The Chapter']"

"Deadmau5 debuted his monstrous Cube 3.0 on Ultra Music’s live stage on March 30. With that in mind, he brought out Lights to perform the classic ‘Raise Your Weapon‘ alongside their collaboration, ‘Drama Free‘. To commemorate the occasion, a recap video was released on Deadmau5’s channel.The video compiles a time-line between February 7 up to the day of the show. It begins by showing stage parts moving into a warehouse where they built the Cube in Toronto. Quickly showcasing the build, videos from the visual testing are presented, demonstrating how massive the project is. Moreover, we’re taken to the rehearsals with Lights ending with the Cube reaching Miami for Ultra. Finally, the on-site rehearsal segment is paired with footage from the live show.It’s going to be exciting to see him take the stage further on tour.

"The walking meme Salvatore Ganacci is back at it again with brand new track ‘Horse‘. You might remember his very interpretive dance stylings at festivals such as Tomorrowland or even as the “Relax your anus” guy while he played Eric Prydz’ ‘Pjanoo‘  If you thought he only brought these shenanigans to festivals, boy are you mistaken.The Bosnian born DJ/Producer continues showcasing his incredibly zany personality through his brand new music video ‘Horse’ which is out now on OWLSA. You won’t believe the envelope and randomness Salvatore Ganacci pushes in this video.It starts off meeting a family at their home out in the woods as well as a lion, goat, horse, and a panda all while the track begins building up to its drop. Once the drop hits, we are taken to visuals of each family member beating the animals with their items such as fists to even a car. Don’t fret taxidermied animals were used to film the video and no animals were harmed in the making of ‘Horse’. Then we are panned to Salvatore Ganacci driving a motorized dress shoe on his way to rescue the animals.  He not only saves the animals but also put each family member through the same pain they caused the animals.To say this is a unique video is an understatement, words don’t do justice to describe this music video. You’ll have to see it to believe it. We’re very curious what goes on in the mind of Salvatore Ganacci, this music video gives us only a small glimpse.

"Knife Party fans rejoice! During their Knifecast Episode 13, they shared their a song called ‘Ghost Train‘ with their listeners. The sound quality isn’t at its peak since its not an official release but it nonetheless is a banger.After a quick buildup of snares and drums, its all aboard the Knife Party train. Choo chooing, chugging, and churning out sonic synths, the track is one hell of a ride. While keeping true to the classic Knife Party sound, it flows into a more modern electronic sound with its interesting drops and voice sampling.The ‘Ghost Train’ might just be related to the ‘Ghost Town‘ track which was previewed back in November. Time will tell as fans patiently wait for the full EP to drop. The duo announced during their Knifecast Episode 11 that the EP was officially finished and was pending label confirmation. With that in mind, let’s hope the EP sees the light of day within the coming month or two just in time for festival season.Embed YouTube Video ",articles11,['Knife Party']

"If you’ve been in the rave scene for quite some time now, you know that some of the most magical moments happen when the DJ interacts with the crowd in a special way.

When they drop ‘Crowd Control‘, the attendees all jump in the same direction, resulting in a wave of people moving from left to right.On April 7, 2019, Twenty One Pilots had the honor of closing Lollapalooza Brasil.

"While there were many viral moments during the first day of Coachella, DJ Snake’s set definitely stood out the most. But why? Because Selena Gomez, Ozuna, and Cardi B joined him on stage in epic fashion for the first ever live performance of ‘Taki Taki‘.Just when the set was about to finish, the French producer played ‘Te Bote’. Shortly after,  Ozuna strolled onto the stage to sing his verses. After he finished, ‘the platinum single ‘Taki Taki’ came on with Cardi B coming out to rap her part. You can already bet everyone at this point is screaming their lungs off out of sheer hype and joy.Then right when everyone thought the performance couldn’t get any better, Selena Gomez sang the outro of the song. Keep in mind that Selena has not performed in public since May 2018. This was truly a triumphant moment for DJ Snake and the three singers. They took over the night with their stellar performance and stage presence.

"Without a doubt one of the best releases at the end of 2018 was ‘Breathe’ by Camelphat and Cristoph. Released via Pryda, the track was first premiered on dance floors at Hï Ibiza last summer. It’s an ethereal song laced with goose bump-inducing vocals from Jem Cooke and intense build ups then drops, making it nothing short of a masterpiece.Fast forward to 2019 and it looks like the track may be getting a breath of fresh air from none other than Eric Prydz. He took to Twitter a few months ago with a cryptic message stating: It seems like the Swedish producer fell in love with the song as much as we did. It only makes sense he develop his own version. Back in February, Prydz performed at Echostage under his alias Pryda and to the surprise of the crow, dropped his new remix.

"After the wait, Andrew Bayer finally officially released ‘In My Next Life‘ on Above & Beyond‘s label, Anjunabeats. It’s an album which takes the tracks from his experimental ‘In My Last Life‘, and turns them into club-ready songs.“Even though ‘In My Last Life’ is experimental and does range through different tempos & styles, I did have the intention of doing club mixes” – Andrew bayerFans were introduced to some of those mixes through his performance at Group Therapy 300 in Hong Kong. ‘Immortal Lover‘ and ‘Open End Source,’ both featuring Alison May, saw earlier releases. Those releases were accompanied by Andrew’s collaboration with Genix to remix ‘Love You More‘ featuring Ane Brune. The two’s efforts happen to be the only collaboration on the album.First on the newer album releases, a fresh club take on ‘Tidal Wave.’ An ethereal pad rises to introduce the hushed and grainy vocal layers, carrying a soft tone. Pads and a lead then propel it into an uplifting club track. Going forward, ‘Hold On To You‘ rockets into an abrasive and dark intro from the start, with the vocals pushing through. It hosts a beautiful breakdown highlighting the melody, with the piano and vocal encompassing it. The string section finally flows the track into the drop section.The fifth song on the album, ‘In My Last Life‘, has a gentle progression adding elements as the track builds. It cultivates into a hopeful and energetic sound bringing all the elements together. Second to last, ‘Your Eyes‘ intros with a deep and vibrant bass, with a synth melody topping it. Breaking down, the vocals are left with the bass only to kick back into the clubby sound. As soon as you think the track will rise, it falls into an ethereal and bright pad. It’s soon interrupted by a sharp and metallic synth leading into a simultaneously heavy and ethereal chorus. Finally, ‘End Of All Things‘ closes out the album on uplifting and harmonious emotions.The stark contrast between ‘‘ and ‘‘ cannot be overlooked. Bayer took a chance creating something totally out of the ordinary and nailed it- only to reinvent those same tracks into club-ready anthems. Well done from Mr. Bayer.You can check out the album below:",articles11,['Those']

"Carl Cox, a house and techno producer truly known around the world, sat down with Mixmag to discuss how the Resistance stage has developed over the years at Ultra Music Festival. He describes how, at the beginning – despite restrictions and limitations – everyone enjoyed having their own unique setting. He reminisces being in the Miami vibe, and now everyone gets to experience something different with the movement to an island. Since the start, Resistance was not able to grow quickly because it was in a tent and as a result of the size of the venue. By having an island, they’re able to pour more into the production. Elaborating on the production, he describes it as “super-sized”. Between the lights and the sound system, Resistance has become its own.Cox takes a moment to discuss the new sound system – a Vero sound system. He mentions having “10 boxes of 32s and 10 boxes 21s” for the sound system. If you hold any sound system knowledge, you know: this is a massive amount of sound.

As fans attempt to hold their excitement for a bit longer, the trio are not taking a break from teasing upcoming surprises. In the past couple days, three symbols (seen above), were posted on the official SHM pages. After a little research, fans recognized the symbols from an art exhibit and photography gallery named Fotografiska.An art gallery may seem odd but SHM has been heavily using visual pieces in their teases. Most importantly, the caption on the Facebook post listed “30.4 – 5.5 2019”, which many believe is the duration of the exhibit during their Stockholm shows May 2,3, and 4. The theme of “rebirth” has also often been associated with the SHM comeback. Perhaps, the exhibit will showcase their journey from past to present.Swedish photographer Alexander Wessely has been a major contributor to the SHM comeback. His work as their Creative Director is nothing short from thought-provoking, moving, and inspiring. Just today, he posted to his Instagram story a video of a poster being revealed (Below).

"The study was able to prove a couple of things that help the argument for medicinal MDMA. First, it proves that there’s a period of adolescence where the brain learns more efficiently. Furthermore, this period of time is critical to the brain developing properly. Secondly, the study shows that the brain can be restored to this state through the use of MDMA. This would allow therapy to be effective in repairing damage from brain diseases.MDMA is already known to help with social disorders like PTSD and Autism. Consequently, more studies are popping up looking to uncover the secrets of the notorious party drug. Along with that, doctors are beginning to speak out against the stigmas surrounding the drug as well. The findings in this study seem to bolster these arguments. The drug is getting more attention from scientists, as a result.MDMA is seemingly on the verge of becoming the next miracle drug. It seems to be riding the coattails of medical marijuana and CBD. The fact that more studies get green-lit based off of positive results is a great benefit by itself. If these findings get the attention they deserve, MDMA and other mind-altering drugs may be on the fast-track to becoming useful medicines. Maybe, those ravers were on to something all along.

Some records are utterly unbelievable and others are impressively insane. On April 3rd, Genix and Ian Kerr set a world record for the highest altitude DJ set.They performed in Kala Patthar, a mountain range in the Nepalese Himalayas. At an altitude of 5590M, which is just over 18,000 feet, the duo performed a B2B set in front tens of bundled up climbers. Trance was able to ring around the mountains in the most incredible way possible.The 25-minute set was to a ticketed audience. It was easily the most beautiful backdrop for a DJ set we have seen. The massive mountains in the background gave us a little bit of that Tomorrowland Winter vibe. The location of the set actually allowed for an almost perfect view of Mount Everest. I don’t think any of us would have ever imagined the day where people would dance to EDM in front of that.The previous record for highest altitude DJ set was also achieved in Nepal. It was done by Chhewang Sherpa. The great part about this record is that there is a limit to this record.

"Seattle’s Re-Bar, a club that has been around for 30 years, is now paving the way with opioid overdose safety. All its patrons come for the dance, music, and performing arts but sometimes things can get a little out of hand. They’re using their new opioid antidote, naloxone, in emergency kits.In the event of an overdose, naloxone nasal spray can revive someone quickly. This project of kits is part of their $2,000 kickstarter for 20 more kits among 10 other nightclubs. Scott Plusquellec, Seattle’s nightlife business advocate, modeled this program after the one in Vancouver, British Columbia.“[This] program is design as a preventative measure and it’s not so much addressing something that is happening in the clubs, but…we want to be able to provide them with another tool in their kit to keep patrons safe” – PlusquellecAs the club owner, Wilson vows to keep his staff trained on the antidote. Its use will be effective in preventing heroin or fentanyl overdose inside clubs. While there hasn’t been one yet, the crisis is prevalent in the neighborhood.The program needs more funding and a communal effort would be greatly beneficial to expand the program among other clubs. Many club owners are on board with the idea as over the past year and a half, the city has seen 6 fentanyl or heroin-based deaths. Intentional or otherwise, friends or acquaintances are losing their lives.In recent times, Seattle is seeing an increase in drug use among tenants as young as teenagers. Bright, young hearts are going out because the access is easy to obtain and inject. To be able to prevent unwarranted deaths is the start to a great public health campaign. The dramatic increase in overdose deaths could lead to no one being around to deal with them anymore.King County Health Department is training staff and Kelly-Ross Pharmacy is supplying the naloxone. We’ll see where this new project takes Seattle in the future.",articles11,"['Seattle’s', 'King County Health Department', 'We’ll']"
"This Friday, April 12th, Joel Zimmerman’s label mau5trap will introduce their newest addition to the horde, Nofone. To say the least, the announcement is exciting, but we’re left with one obvious question: who the f*** is Nofone?? Like Deadmau5 with Testpilot and Eric Prydz with Pryda or Cirez D, Nofone is most definitely an alias for another prominent producer.Mau5trap has given us the acclaimed EP S and Rezz‘s album  , so we know the new addition will be on par in quality. One Reddit user, Balbaugh92, suspects it may be an alias for No Mana, which isn’t too bad of a guess.
Card
Deadmau5 teased a snippet of Nofone’s upcoming single ‘Who is it,’ a fitting title for the anonymous producer. You can hear it on  Radio episode 028. Besides this bit, there isn’t much more information out there. The label has kept it all tied down. Their social media is barren and their website is listed as under construction. I guess we’ll have to wait until Friday to hear the single. But, will we find out who this is? Only time will tell.Who do you think it is?

"Back in 2011, Porter Robinson was already on the rise to the stardom in the dance music scene thanks to his explosive Spitfire EP. Full of gritty, electro style tracks Spitfire shot straight up the charts, landing both #1 on Itunes & Beatport. But come 2012, Porter releases ‘Language’ which would go on to become his most iconic track (perhaps only to be overtaken by ‘Shelter’ in recent times). ‘Language’ was a stark departure from the  style Porter was known for. Featuring a softer, melodic, more dreamlike approach, ‘Language’ skyrocketed to the top of the charts & into the hearts of fans everywhere. I still remember hearing the song for the first time as part of Forza Horizon’s soundtrack. I genuinely didn’t believe it was porter at first but hey was I ever glad to be wrong.Looking back at the track on its 7th anniversary it has stood the test of time rather well I’d say. That melody and Heather Brights (uncredited) vocals still bring back all those feels and that beautiful drop? Nothing less than perfection. Language truly marks the turning point in Porter’s musical career, especially as it serves as the precursor to perhaps one of the best dance albums in modern times ‘Worlds’. So sit back, get ready for a trip down memory lane & stream ‘Language’ down below.",articles11,"['Porter Robinson', 'Spitfire', 'Porter']"
"By now, some of you may know, the first single from Avicii‘s posthumous album has been released for the world to hear. ‘SOS‘ featuring Aloe Blacc, has hit us right in the feels all over again, just like the duo’s legendary track ‘Wake Me Up‘ did in the past.Blacc’s stunning vocals alongside the Swedish producer’s uplifting and classic melodies are a match made in heaven. When listening to their collaborations, it comes as no surprise that the two were not only musical colleagues but also dear friends. Their special bound can be heard flowing through the tracks.Recently, the Panamanian-American singer chimed in, less than a week after the new track dropped, to share that there may be even more impeccable tunes released on the horizon.While “S.O.S” is a good track, it might not reach those sky-high levels of “Wake Me Up” so news like this is certainly very welcome. In our opinion, the late DJ’s forthcoming album TIM would be a wonderful platform to showcase these undeniable historic pieces.",articles11,['Blacc’s']
"This year has been the year of changes for Ultra Music Festival. Although the festival is now over, The City of Miami is still not done talking about it. Today, Commissioner Joe Carollo as well as others had a lot to say regarding this year. The Agreement between Miami and Ultra allows the City 60 days after Ultra’s completion to object prior to the following year being locked in. This is why the opposition is creeping up again already.Although we all knew there would be hiccups within the festival this year, The City of Miami is hanging on to Ultra by a thread. Joe Carollo, who originally sparked the debate of Ultra’s contract at the Bayfront Park; expects supporters of the festival to stay silent while complainers are welcome to complain.The entire hearing today seemed designed to bring in “aggrieved” parties whining endlessly because of the “low frequency bass” torturing them from miles away on a weekend night. One after the next sob stories about how horrible Ultra is revolved around little more than 1) traffic snarls and 2) bass. The Mayor of Miami was quick to note that Miami Music Week is spread out all over the city and music can be coming from literally anywhere during the time.The Mayor of Miami was very supportive of the event, but he was also suggesting changes. He suggested the closing times were too late, there needed to be a standard for “low frequency bass” heard at Brickell, more ferries were needed, Vizcaya was not suitable as a shuttle hub, and ferries/buses should not play loud music during return trips. Another Commissioner felt the mainstage should face away from Downtown and Brickell so the sound does not reverberate that direction. This would flip the entire layout.Carollo seemed disappointed in Ultra’s overall performance after asking While other commissioners emphasized problems with this years festival during today’s meeting, they recognized the limited time Ultra realistically had for planning. City manager, Emilio Gonzalez expressed major support and said that he believes the festival operations could be tweaked for future events. He brought up that Ultra should be using more water vessels, adjusting the time of the festival, as well as the bus shuttle system.Keon Hardemon opened his statement by thanking Ultra for another marvelous year of the festival following Miami Music Week. All together, commissioners came to the conclusion that Virginia Key was not an appropriate venue for the enormous festival.The Commissioners set the final vote for May 9. They want to give notice to all interested parties in favor or against so they can show up and be heard before a decision is made. The “get off my lawn” crowd and the detractors are betting that Ultra’s supporters will stay quiet while the complainers will be out in force.

"Ultra Music Festival might still be in the process of clearing out of Virginia Key, but the battle lines are already being drawn for next year’s edition. On Tuesday evening, Key Biscayne held its city council meeting where a Motion passed unanimously to oppose Ultra’s return in 2020. It should be noted however that Key Biscayne opposed Ultra in 2019 and is generally not expected to be friendly towards any events. Key Biscayne’s Mayor will address the Miami City Commission meeting on Thursday to express his opposition.The license agreement between Ultra and Miami is controlled only by the Miami City Commission, which will meet Thursday. As has been publicized before, the same Commissioner who spearheaded Ultra’s removal from Bayfront Park has added Ultra to Thursday’s list of discussion topics. The City has a period of about 60 days from the end of Ultra 2019 to void the agreement before it locks in for 2020.Out of the woodwork returns Attorney, David Winker, who sued Ultra to stop the festival on behalf of the Brickell Homeowners Association. With his emergency injunction rejected, he has now resorted to agitating at the Miami Commission Meeting to turn them against the festival. On Tuesday he emailed the Miami City Commissioners and various blogs about what he claims are Ultra’s breaches of the license agreement. He stated in his email:While the battle lines are drawn against Ultra, the festival has plenty of important allies as well. On April 9, City Manager Emilio Gonzalez issued the Ultra Music Festival 2019 Preliminary Recap Report, which was generally positive. The report noted that Ultra had problems with egress on Friday due to not pre-positioning buses early enough ahead of time – and that this was due to Ultra lacking jurisdiction over Rickebacker Causeway. Gonzales notes that after the initial difficulty and inpute from Miami PD, Fire Rescue and Miami-Dade PD, changes were quickly implemented that resolved the issues. There were also concerns about noise in coastal neighborhoods despite Ultra staying within its allowable limits.“The City is confident that, when the event returns to Virginia Key next year, additional operational enhancements and resources can be implemented to further improve transportation and noise mitigation” – City ManagerAll in all Ultra had 281 EMT calls, 37 arrests, 13 disturbance calls answered, and 36 noise complaints. Honestly that is staggeringly good for a a brand new location with so many new variables to consider. EDC Vegas 2018 had 33 arrests during the first day. In 2017 EDC Vegas had 443 medical calls on one night alone.A small brush fire took place on Friday due to a pyrotecnic display, which was quickly contained. There was a subsequent brush fire on Friday night which was extinguished. Pyro was halted for the remainder of the festival by the Fire Marshall.The report notes that fencing worked well, adequate amount of food/drink vendors, and enough water stations to keep people hydrated. The report didn’t miss the fact that cellular reception was terrible on the island however.

"Tim ‘Avicii’ Bergling tragically took his own life on April 20, 2018 at the age of 28. Since then, he’s had an album’s worth of nearly finished music which could have stayed in the dark. His family members decided to release those songs in an album titled ‘TIM. However, we are currently graced with the single ‘S.O.S.‘ featuring Aloe Blacc.  Aloe is a previous collaborator of Tim’s, hosting his vocals on ‘Wake Me Up‘ in 2013.‘S.O.S.’ is a blatantly personal track, kicking off the lyrics with “Can you hear me S.O.S., help me put my mind to rest.” His friends and collaborators mentioned how the music shaped its meaning to them after his passing. Aloe’s vocals on the first single sit on a bed of quiet piano chords accompanying hushed plucks. The positive sounding music can bring an interesting contrast to the lyrical content of the track. It draws tropical house elements, and goes into an easy-on-the-ear feeling.“The songwriters that Tim was collaborating with on this album have continued the process to get as close to his vision as possible.”Avicii’s family conveyed that proceeds from the album will be donated to the non-profit Tim Bergling Foundation. The foundation is currently setting its focus on mental health and suicide prevention.

"Tim “Avicii” Bergling was working on his third album when he passed away at 28 years old on April 20, 2018.Soon, the world will hear the release of the first single from the album he left behind – nearly an exact year after his death. In June, the full posthumous album, TIMwill be shared with all of us. Avicii stated that he believed these new songs were the best ones he has written in years.In an interview with Dagens Nyheter, a Swedish Magazine, Tim’s father Klas Bergling discusses the impact that his death had on him, and the world of music as a whole. He shares:Avicii’s body was discovered last year at his villa in Oman. His death came as an utter shock to the world, but even more so to the people close to him who thought he was “doing better”. We have learned about the excessive pressure from touring that Avicii faced, as well as the medical complications he dealt with as a result of alcohol and prescription medication.Discovered at a very young age, Avicii skyrocketed into the spotlight with his incredibly unique, intricate sound. The documentary “Avicii: True Stories” provides deeper insight into the struggles he was facing and the way this stress impacted his entire well-being.The details provided by family and friends in the interviews conducted by Dagens Nyheter provide additional insight to the emotional fragility of Avicii’s death.The magazine also interviews music producers and friends of Avicii, Kristoffer Fogelmark and Albin Nedler. Nedler says, “It was like Tim had stepped out of that dark hole… he was feeling so much better”. They discuss ‘SOS’, Avicii’s song that will release on April 10, 2019. The two of them point out the dark lyrics in the track.Fogelmark and Nedler explain that previously, they thought these lyrics were feelings from the past. Now that Tim is gone, they can’t help but think,. Avicii had been through so much. From ridiculous touring schedules to multiple hospitalizations, he bravely professed his desire to make a change for himself and his lifestyle. In May 2016, he made the decision to stop touring. In a clip captured in “Avicii: True Stories”, he says:From then on, Avicii strove to build a new life for himself. His desire for composing and producing music came back, which was what he truly loved to do. His mental and physical health dramatically improved, as did his outlook on life. Or so it seemed.On April 17 in Oman, Avicii made notes in his phone, seeming to serve as reminders for himself. These notes say things like, “Spread positivity… bring the artists up… transfer emotion to the song”.Three days later, Avicii is found dead on his floor.Klas Bergling and Anki Lidén have spearheaded the Tim Bergling Foundation, which will focus on suicide prevention and mental health awareness. In addition, they want to promote open dialogue about mental health, in opposition to heavy sedation and medication as being a primary option for recovery. This foundation, in honor of Avicii, speaks to the legacy he left behind. Klas Bergling says,Klas Bergling says that he can find comfort in listening to Avicii’s new songs. He is proud of his song and says that the fact he [Avicii] left music which so many people want to hear, is actually soothing. Klas Bergling concludes his interview by saying:We are all waiting in anticipation to hear the songs that Avicii left behind. His legacy will never die, nor will his bright, inspiring light.

"It has been a whirlwind of a year for the DJ known as Datsik. Back in March 2018, multiple allegations arose of the famed DJ committing sexual misconduct. He canceled all remaining dates on his Ninja Nation tour schedule. Many DJs recused themselves from his brand amidst the swirling accusations. He was dropped from his record label and by his booking agents. He was publicly called out by high-profile acts such as Jauz for “being a horrible fucking human being.” After that, Datsik went off the grid.This week, we noticed a resurfacing – that there are plans for a Datsik comeback. In a DM post on Instagram, Datsik shared that he will make a comeback “when the time is right.” He also has this to reveal: By all appearances, it looks like Datsik is doing well and attempting to come back to the scene.

One of his friends neglected to call the ambulance or alert anyone for over an hour after his initial reaction to the drugs.Dr. Balboa, Jackson’s GP, deemed him a suicide risk for falling in between the ages of 13 and 15. He also reported Jackson being admitted ten times to various hospitals between March 2015 and December 2017. His admittance reason was drug overdoses. This trend in and of itself confirms that the boy seemed to be committing suicide at the club.The inquest further showed that Gibbons’ friend supplied him with the drugs. They took the drugs along with another friend and threw themselves into an unfit state of mind. It is unclear whether or not either friend will be charged with aiding Gibbon’s death.With suspicions confirmed, the cause of death was toxic effects of MDMA/ecstasy. We’ve heard of the many deaths from festivals due to heat exhaustion, though we ever expected one to be of suicide. It’s very important to keep your friends safe, folks. If you know they are in a crisis, please help them call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK. They can also contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741.We all have a right to enjoy festivals in our way, but it’s never a good thing to see someone get hurt.",articles11,"['Jackson’s', 'Gibbon’s']"
"Notaker has been on a roll recently, dropping hot singles like ‘ft. Eric Lumiere’ and ‘ ft. Karra’, towards the buildup of his sophomore Monstercat EP, PATH.FINDER. The EP follows last year’s mau5trap release ‘Erebus I’The PATH.FINDER EP is the third EP in his proclaimed Vessel series. Which, according to him, is a way for him to showcase and discuss stories and themes not possible to convey in just one song. in this 6 track EP, he assembles emotionally powerful, synth-heavy bass music by crafting radiant soundscapes & coupling it with masterful production. Coming to the EP itself:The intro track, Only in My Dreams, combines spacey vocals (courtesy of his wife) & powerful synths to perfectly set up a solid introductory track.The lead single, Into the Light featuring Karra is probably my favorite tune off this EP. Karra’s stunning vocals combined with a mystical progressive atmosphere make an amazing melodic glitch-influenced anthem.Melophonic is definitely the hardest hitting track on this EP,  he’s been teasing this song for years now. Filled with deep basses & a 8 bit style melody Melophonic goes all in. And that final drop? That really does turns up the energy.Up next is Each Other, a blissful uplifting melodic anthem reminiscent of Seven Lions style. With Eric Lumiere on vocal duty & an infectious melodic drop, this track is a blast from the past hailing towards his  roots.The Longest Night is another stark reminder of Notaker’s original synthwave style. Those retro synths coupled with light chords & arpeggios, make The Longest Night an amazing house influenced synthwave track.On the final track, Notaker flips his powerful melodic anthem, Into the Light, into a chilled, intoxicating composition again taking cues from his synthwave days & lets not forget Notaker himself did the vocals for this VIP. Into the Light VIP is unmistakably one of Notaker’s most unique productions to date.Overall the PATH.FINDER EP is a solid follow up to both Genesis and Erebus I. It charts the evolution of Notaker as a musical artist as he explores a more melodic sound throughout, and it’s exciting to see him evolve his sound even more on future releases.",articles11,"['Karra’', 'Karra', 'Karra’s', 'Notaker’s', 'Those', 'Notaker', 'Notaker’s']"

"To quote Beyoncé, “who run the world? Girls.” This is especially the case for the techno Queens, Nina Kraviz and Amelie Lens who have recently topped Festicket‘s list of “Most Festivals Played in 2018“!It comes as no surprise that DJs are constantly traveling the globe; what may shock some is who has played the most festivals last year.The UK-based festival discovery website has recently unveiled that Nina Kraviz secured the number one slot with an impressive total of 35 festivals played in 2018.Coming in second place, Amelie Lens held the spot with a whopping 27 festivals under her belt in 2018. Rewinding back to 2017-2018, the Belgian musician had only played a mere 4 festivals, still something to celebrate, but we’re positive this newfound success resonates with her more!Congratulations are in order! We are overjoyed to see the female DJs getting the recognition that they deserve in this male-heavy industry.Kraviz and Lens beat the legendary Armin van Buuren (26 festivals), Charlotte De Witte (24 festivals), Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike (22 festivals), and that’s just to name a few.

"Caprices Festival is making its return to the snowy Swiss alps for its 16th edition this coming weekend. The event takes place in Crans-Montana, a ski resort village in Southern Switzerland. The awe-inspiring backdrops are suitable only for the very best that Techno has to offer. In fact, Caprices Festival welcomes the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Seth Troxler, Jamie Jones, Pan-Pot and many more April 11th – 14th.Last year’s edition saw the event win the Best International Festival at the 2018 DJ Awards. Nevertheless, it seems this year’s will be even greater. Previous editions of the festival hosted two stages, one at the the bottom of the Cry D’er Ski Lifts (The Moon) and one that sits 2200m above sea level and accessible only by cablecar (MDRNTY). This year will see the opening of a third stage, Satellite. Satellite is located near The Moon and features a special opening party on Thursday April 11th. Additionally, Satellite will showcase Swiss artists throughout the weekend so be sure to check that out.Perhaps the most breath-taking venue at Caprices is MDRNTY. The stage consists of a one-off, greenhouse-like dome with panoramic views of the world renown Swiss alps. The stage plays host to two of the most anticipated sets: Ricardo Villalobos’ Friday sunset set and Sven Väth who closes out the stage Sunday from 5pm to 8pm.Apart from the world-class lineup, Caprices Festival offers everything you’d expect from a music festival held in the Swiss Alps. The village offers high end restaurants, a wellness center, boutique shops, and nearly 100 miles of the finest ski powder Switzerland has to offer.Get your tickets here and watch this space for Caprices 2019 updates.

"It’s been a rough week for Coachella. Recent bombshells hitting the presses definitely have their PR and event coordination teams working on overdrive. The first weekend of the festival is just 4 days away and the bad news keeps coming. As if the horrible news of a stagehand falling to his death wasn’t enough, the event got a second major blow yesterday. Solange Knowles, scheduled for both Saturdays, has pulled out of the event at the last minute. This has sent event producers scrambling to fill a huge void in the festival’s lineup.Knowles, infamous for giving Jay-Z the business in an elevator, seems to be doing the same to Coachella here. Citing “major production delays,” Solange is backing out of Coachella at the last second. Exactly what that means is unclear at this time, as multiple news outlets are reaching out for clarification. There’s no response as of yet, but one is sure to come with the amount of shade being thrown her way by fans.Due to major production delays, Solange will unfortunately no longer be performing at this year's festival. She sends her sincerest apologies, and looks forward to performing at Coachella in the future.— Coachella (@coachella) April 8, 2019The question on everyone’s minds with the void left by Solange: what now? Concertgoers expecting her to grace the stage on days alongside artists like Bassnectar and Kid Cudi are now left wondering. Fans are quickly shouting out and tagging their suggestions on Coachella’s Twitter feed. Recommendations of the Jonas Brothers, Lana Del Rey, and Jhené Aiko have all popped up repeatedly. Additionally, some big-name acts themselves are offering to step up to the plate. Smashmouth offered its services in a response tweet seen here:we got this— Smash Mouth (@smashmouth) April 8, 2019At this point, it seems like Solange is just another chapter in the long story of issues surrounding Coachella. Every year, the event is plagued with some sort of controversy. The rampant sexual harassment reports that surfaced were not pretty last year. That comes on top of the body-shaming and anti-gay accusations of 2017. Reports of douchebaggery go all the way back to 2014. Although this latest news is clearly out of Coachellas hands, it’s notoriety for having problems looms large nonetheless.Regardless, Coachella definitely bounces back every year with great lineups and solid performances across the board. This year’s bill is full of diversity as the event is hoping to draw a much more inclusive crowd. The day club lineup is stacked as well for sure. Love it or hate it, it’s still one of the premier events in the U.S. every year. Surely they will find a way of digging themselves out of this hole too.Follow Coachella’s social media as more news becomes available.",articles11,"['Recent', 'Saturdays', 'Knowles', 'Jay-Z', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Kid Cudi', 'Jonas Brothers', 'Lana Del Rey', 'Smash Mouth', 'Solange']"
"In the constant battle of Apple Music vs Spotify, it appears that Apple Music has taken a slight lead. According to new data released by the Wall Street Journal, a report released last week revealed that Apple Music now currently holds 28 million paid subscribers in the United States. This overtakes the 26 million paid subscribers for Spotify—by a substantial amount.Spotify still maintains the global edge over Apple Music, which incorporates free tier users as well. This is evident by over 95 million for Spotify worldwide versus roughly 50 million for Apple. However, Apple Music has shown a steady growth between 2.6% to 3% in the past year. This compares to Spotify’s modest growth of 1.5% to 2% in the same timeframe.With iPhone users at over 900 million worldwide and Apple Music pre-installed on every new phone, Apple Music has placed itself in a tremendous position for this overthrow. Apple has show strong dedication in building new services and playlists for paid subscribers as well. These services cater specifically to iPhone users, and their sleek marketing campaigns seem to be working. Additionally, Apple has worked with phone plan carriers to incorporate Apple Music subscriptions into their deals.While the battle for streaming supremacy wages on, the next frontier remains with one question: how can these platforms provide “different” options from each other? A big complaint is that it doesn’t really matter which service you have. Ultimately, users will have access to almost all of the same music.Where do you stand in the debate? Are you loyal to Apple, or are you in the Spotify camp?",articles11,"['Spotify', 'Spotify', 'Spotify', 'iPhone', 'iPhone']"
"In hindsight, Ultra Miami wrapped up on a good note despite a rocky first day, which entailed logistical nightmares left and right. So much so, that it was compared to being the next Fyre Festival. While Ultra really pulled through with some major restructuring for day 2 and 3, they can barely breathe a sigh of relief as they’re now forced to face the city commission once more on April 11th.Miami Commissioner, Joe Carollo, who originally sparked the debate to end Ultra’s contract at Bayfront Park, will lead the meeting. It’s no secret that Carollo isn’t particularly a fan over this massive music festival. Still, it’s hard not to acknowledge the money and economy it brings to the city. In Ultra’s deal to set camp in Virginia Key, Carollo was able to gung-ho a $2 million fee—over half a million jump from the original rate of $1.4 million. This $2 million only guaranteed the 2019 season, however, and future editions in Miami are still very open to discussion.Additionally, keeping in mind that many Key Biscayne residents also initially shared their reservations regarding this massive moving into the neighborhood, they will no doubt be called forward again to re-explore their concerns.What will happen to Ultra Miami? Is Ultra Orlando or Ultra LA an impending thought? All of this may just depend on how this meeting goes—so stayed tuned!",articles11,['Virginia Key']

"Although the statement is still in its draft phase, the proposed actions therein would shake the culture of the event to its very core. As a result, Burning Man has issued a call to action for all Burners.With an April 29th deadline looming, the call to action asks for the public to speak out. The Burning Man Project, looking to secure a 10 year permit, is asking for the public to help shape the future of the event through their public outcry. The final draft of the economic impact statement will be due out later this summer so the public will definitely need to act fast. The following statement from Burning Man via Black Rock City (BRC) News highlights the urgency:Despite being a pillar of the community, respecting the environment and protecting its culture, the event is under fire. Burning Man Project feels that the reputation of the event was overlooked when the EIS was drafted. Hence, the call to action.In its plead for support, Burning Man has listed some of the most arduous proposed changes that will alter the culture of the event. It’s biggest issues was being forced into maintaining CR-34 which leads to the entrance of the event. Measures such as enclosing the event in fencing, providing waste bins, and hiring private security also raise issues of costs. Estimates place cost increases at upwards of $20 million per year.Additionally, a suggested change in the event’s length from 8 to 9.5 days would increase costs further. Finally, the event producers also take issue with the proposed ideas for population caps and moving the event site. Both would inevitably shake the festival’s culture to its core.Burning Man has pleaded with the community and its supporters to let their voices be heard. They’re asking all stakeholders to attend the two upcoming hearings: April 8 in Reno and April 9 in Lovelock. Furthermore, they need the public to comment on the EIS but have asked that you read the commenting guidelines first which can be found here. Once you have a firm grasp of how you can be effective, they’ve asked that you comment on the BLM comment form here or by emailing blm_nv_burningmaneis@blm.gov (be sure to copy Burning Man at eis@burningman.org.)If you love this event, consider yourself a Burner, or care about the culture these types of events promote, then you don’t want to miss this opportunity to stand with Burning Man.

"With Coachella just around the corner, preparations for the festival are in full swing. However, we are deeply saddened to learn of the death of one of the workers on Saturday. The man identified as Christopher Griffin was helping set up one of the many festival stages. Eyewitnesses state he was climbing some stage scaffolding to do some rigging ahead of Friday’s opening day. While it is still unclear exactly how he fell from a height of 60 feet to his death, he was not wearing a safety harness which could have prevented his fall.The Riverside County Police & Fire Department were informed of the incident at around 9:30 am ET. Unfortunately, he was pronounced dead on the scene. The police are currently investigating the exact circumstances surrounding the man’s death.Coachella has gone on without fatalities up until 2014 when a female attendee died of a drug overdose. That incident is considered to be one of if not the first in the festivals two-decade-long history.In a written statement Saturday, the festival’s production company, Goldenvoice, confirmed the death.H/T TMZ ",articles11,"['Friday’s', 'Fire Department']"
"When you think of Las Vegas you might think of casinos, EDC, perhaps the Grand Canyon, or the superb nightlife scene. There’s a lot to do in Las Vegas and each place is constantly evolving in order to increase the experience, including the Palms Casino Resort. As of April 4th, 2019, the Kaos club has officially opened. It’ll make you want to scream, !Unlike most clubs, Kaos is located away from the strip. This place is massive. Its day club stretches to 73,000 square feet, while the nightclub amounts to 29,000 square feet. Everything about the space is extravagant.

"I’ve been to Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld (even the bad year), smaller festivals, and of course Ultra Music Festival at Bayfront Park. I’ve gone to Bayfront Park every year since 2012 and to me, the formula had gotten a tad bit old even before 2019. Ultra had become a well-oiled machine, and sure it was impressive but it was also so predictable. In many ways I was thrilled that Ultra was gonna change it up at a new bigger venue. I had also experienced my fair share of long walks, festival mishaps *coughcoughMudWorldcoughcough* and also festivals like SMF in Tampa that routinely had to stop the festivities for hours at a time due to torrential downpours. Now that’s not to say I didn’t have amazing times at Bayfront, because of course I did. However Ultra was dealt the cards that it was dealt and so there’s no use whining about it for things that aren’t going to happen, and plus Bayfront wasn’t perfect either.Ultra’s move to Virginia Key gave the festival the opportunity to show an entirely new side of itself. That new side is Resistance Island – the “new” Ultra. With the added space, Ultra could add amenities that festivals like Tomorrowland and EDC had, all while keeping its bleeding edge advantage in terms of lineup exclusives and new music. I went in knowing there would be bumps. Companies budget and plan things out about a year (or more). Now imagine that halfway through the year your expenses and overhead double, entirely new departments need to be created to handle entirely new problems, you need to rework your event from scratch, and you can’t raise ticket prices. Well that’s what happened to Ultra in 2019. Ultra had only a few months to create (from scratch) entirely new stages, a transportation and parking plan, an environmental plan, and an entirely new layout. It was a gargantuan feat, and despite a tough start the festival actually did pull it off.It wasn’t perfect obviously – it was a good ways off from perfect. Even Armin van Buuren expected it might be an awkward first year, but he predicted the festival would find its groove by year 2. There are things you can’t predict on paper, you have to just do it and see what happens. You can see the seeds of something awesome at Virginia Key, and once the logistical aspects get hammered down, the festival can really start growing into something leaps and bounds beyond what it was before.Every change is going to have its pros and its cons. There are some things that are better than Bayfront and some that are worse. I’m gonna break it down below and let you know what was great about Ultra 2019, what needs some work, and two things that were really awful and will hopefully never happen again.The bottom line though is that Ultra was dealt its hand, and it made the best of it. It managed to pull it off relatively well considering how much worse it wouldve’ been at some po-dunk Speedway in Homestead. The festival even got better in some ways as a result, so be constructive in how they can improve but trust that Ultra will make the changes to optimize this new space over time.One review from another blog noted that Ultra felt empty this year. Hallelujah! That’s amazing!! Seriously – Ultra added capacity for 5,000 additional attendees per day and yet it felt empty to some. Ultra had just as many people as before, if not more but now Ultra finally has some space to stretch out. The mainstage enters facing the stage now so it’s much easier for people to file in and find their spot without everybody flooding in at the very front corner of the stag like before. There was enough space that the VIP section was expanded to something like what you find at EDC and, for the first time in my memory, media were granted access. However the bulk of the added space went towards the next item on the list.You could almost say it was all worth it just for this. Resistance Island is a gem – just the perfect techno oasis right on the beach. While the Marine Stadium area still felt distinctly like the Ultra you already know with lots of bright-eyed “first-festies” who can’t wait to see David Guetta and Zedd in the concrete jungle, Resistance Island felt completely different. It felt like Electric Forest or Okeechobee, but featured an A++ techno lineup you won’t find at basically any other US festival.The three stages were spread out but not far enough apart that you couldn’t easily roam among them. There were hammocks setup near the beach area which was within 50 feet of of the megastructure. Of course the Megastructure remains the best festival stage outside of Europe if not anywhere in the world. In fact, the Megastructure costs more than the mainstage, and you can see why. The best way to sum up Resistance Island is that you could catch deadmau5′ testpilot techno alias close out the festival Sunday Night without feeling even a little bit crowded in a pretty cool warehouse-vibe enclosed stage (Reflector). If you were feeling tired from  3 days of raving, you could lay down on the grass right outside the stage and watch from there without taking away from the vibe one bit.If you’re a veteran festivalgoer or a techno fan you might not even want to leave Resistance Island and many are wondering how ASOT could somehow slot its way in there.This isn’t really a change for Ultra but it shouldn’t be taken for granted. While other festivals try to focus on gimmicky themes and platitudes to PLUR to hide the fact that their lineup contains nothing special, Ultra is still laser-focused on having the most cutting edge badass lineup in electronic dance music and enough LED screens to make your head spin. Resistance Island only kicked it up a notch because there an entirely new stage plus an additional megastructure day to fill with the best names in techno. There were only a handful of names you could say were missing from the techno lineup, and we will surely see Cirez D return soon enough.Over at the Marine Stadium area you had the Cube 3.0 debut, Gigantic NGHTMRE, and plenty of other exclusives along with the biggest headliners you come to expect. Ultra is when the DJs premiere their new music for the year and none of that is going to change.In such a momentous year its easy to overlook the simple things that Ultra has nailed down over the years. We finally got wristbands that worked pretty flawlessly and nobody had to worry about losing their ticket or having it stolen out of their bag. The water stations were plentiful, easy to use, and with almost no lines. There used to be a time when the line was a mile long and even a year when the water station was basically a hose. In case of bugs they had free bug spray stations. The food vendors were generally pretty solid and most of them took credit cards or even Apple Pay. They had lockers which had been long requested. The app worked relatively well for scheduling and also for rewards points, which people finally starting accumulating enough of to attain Gold status this year.  The little things seem easy but when they go wrong they get noticed.As trance suffered a setback across the US in the past few years and lost real estate at other festivals, Ultra remained the one festival that still had the guts to put trance on the biggest stages and give it the respect it deserves. Many felt that this year ASOT got short-changed on the new Live Arena stage. Part of what made ASOT so magical was the amazing megastructure and the same type of vibes that now live permanently over at Resistance Island.The Live Arena stage was actually the same width and length of the old megastructure, but without any of the ceiling panels that brought it to the next level. It also blocked off the left side for production/artist and stuck a giant mainstage divider in the center. This really kills the vibe for trance and also lead to the entire stage feeling extremely crowded. There was no way you were gonna make your way up to the front from the back this year. Also the power tripped during deadmau5 and Armin van Buuren’s set. There was some curse over there. If they could take out those dividers and slap some LED screens on the ceiling we’d be more or less in business. Although, some of us wish that somehow ASOT could make its way over to Resistance Island because it would fit right in over there.While the Miami Marine Stadium area had plenty of open space, it’s a fairly simple rectangle setup and it wasn’t easy fitting 4 stages in there. The stages need room for overflow, room for other concessions, bathrooms, and the stages can’t blast music in a way that might harm those fish in captivity across the street, or whatever.So you had 3 stages all right up against eachother (Live, Worldwide, and Radio) with crowds overflowing into eachother and situations where you might hear all 3 stages at once. As deadmau5 began wrapping up his Cube 3.0 show with a gorgeous new ID track, you could hear drops from the UMF Radio stage. This annoyed people to varying degrees, but there must be a better way to arrange those stages or design them differently. Perhaps one of the 3 stages needs to adopt a 360 structure and take over the position of that massive circular bar in the dead center of the festival.Also the Worldwide stage does not work at all where it was placed. It was meant for huge overflow on both sides, but now one side is blocked off by water. In 2013 the Worldwide stage had a similar issue when, incredibly, a gate was put up on the side of the stage near the street. The overcrowding and pushing became very dangerous over there and it was never seen again. Now we don’t know how Ultra plans to tackle this admittedly complicated issue, but there must be plenty of options and we’re sure it’ll be remedied next year.This is one issue that really can’t be fixed, but only dealt with. It sucks in one way or another for everybody. For some they just cant stand walking (despite dancing/jumping for 5+ hours a day for 3+ days consecutively). For others it just means you need to leave a set 20-30 minutes early to switch areas, and that can be a bummer when you’re forced to leave a magical Armin set to catch testpilot for the first time (only slightly bitter about it).The thing that sucks the most about the walk is that there are largely no bathrooms, concessions, or distractions along the way. Tomorrowland and TomorrowWorld featured similarly long walks, but there were things along the way so it wasn’t just a simple walk from A to B. If UMF Radio stage could be stuck somewhere in between that would be amazing and solve possibly 2 problems in one. Beyond that maybe a few porta-potties or drink vendors along the way might be good.More space means more space to walk so it’s a trade off, but it isn’t the worst thing in the world. That being said, I’m all for selling Golf Cart passes next year too.The shuttle system is a pain – but anything is a pain compared to how easy it used to be. The festival was right at the intersections of all public transport and you could just walk there from Downtown and Brickell. But hey, all those nearby condos are what forced the festival out so it is what it is now. Shuttling itself is less convenient than walking it, but the real loss here hat nobody is taking about is the loss of the Ultra pregame.No matter where you lived, you were gonna ride into Downtown or Brickell to pregame with your squad and ride into Ultra all together. Sure there were stragglers, but they showed up eventually before you made the walk over. People from South Beach, Coral Gables, Downtown, Ft. Lauderdale, or whever all came in to meet up. Now that’s sorta over because the most convenient Shuttle Stop is C over in Vizcaya and everyody is spread out among the 3 shuttle stops and the Ferry. Beyond that, the extra time involved in Shuttling or ubering over takes up time that would have been spent at the pregame. I stayed in Coral Gables, so there was no reason to uber 25 minutes over to Downtown or Brickell only to hop in a Shuttle or uber all the way back. For the first time in years, I went to Ultra without any Ultra pregame and it was sad.There’s no way to sugarcoat it, Friday was a mess. It wasn’t TomorrowWorld bad, and it certainly wasn’t Fyre Festival bad – but the complete lack of information combined with a long walk made it pretty sh*ty to say the least. At the outset there was a nice plan I had in my head to go find my Shuttle C stop, but when things ended and I was at Resistance everybody said “keep walking” far past where the C stop was. Shuttle A? Keep walking, Shuttle B? Keep walking, Shuttle C? Yep, keep walking. The lack of knowledge or the purposeful concealing of knowledge by the police and other transport organizers on Friday is what really kicked off the chaos.I made the long walk from the front of the Megastructure all the way back to the Vizcaya metro station almost 3 miles away, but to honest I still got home by like 4:15. There were times when I stayed in Coconut Grove and didn’t get back from Bayfront until 3 (and that was with 2 less hours of festival). I’d be in favor of a Ferry escape pass that only allows you to use the Ferry on the way out. Although by Sunday night the shuttling system seemed to be smoothed out..@KFC bought Colonel Sanders a slot on the @Ultra main stage, and this happened. 🐔🥚😂 | 📹: @1001TLtv pic.twitter.com/8qZfUZ7G4K— Festive Owl (@TheFestiveOwl) March 29, 2019Gotta pay those bills, but this was a weird way to do it. At least 7UP earned itself some EDM cred and did some interesting collaborations with artists when it made a huge push into the scene. It was corny and cringey in all of the worst ways, and everybody knew it. When they raise ticket prices next year (just a guess) you’ll probably wish Colonel Sanders played b2b with Wendy to keep those ticket prices low though.",articles11,"['SMF', 'Bayfront', 'Every', 'Zedd', 'Electric Forest', 'PLUR', 'ASOT', 'Arena', 'ASOT', 'Armin', 'I’m', 'Golf Cart', 'Sure', 'Coral Gables', 'Downtown', 'TomorrowWorld', 'Shuttle B', '4:15', 'Wendy']"
"Man do we love a good Eric Prydz teaser. The last few times we have been privy to his mysterious shenanigans, we were gifted with his EPIC and HOLO shows. Today, a new puzzle arises from the depths – the announcement of a new Eric Prydz VOID concept show. As evidenced in the trailer, the VOID concept show will debut at the London Steel Yard Creamfields event on August 23, 2019.His hologram shows are becoming a thing of legend. While we are unsure of what to expect, we did get another piece of the puzzle. Teased at the very end, we learn that VOID stands for “visual offset isometric design.” I’m no Engineering expert, but my best guess is the use of holograms and space in a way that we have never seen before from a DJ (or perhaps even from NASA). Needless to say, it’s going to be another leap forward in the evolution of his live show experience.Most importantly, it appears that Prydz has fully recovered from whatever ailment held him out of Ultra and Miami Music Week. We are happy to hear that he is near full health, and coming back to blow our minds once again!Check out the full teaser trailer below – what could VOID be?!?!",articles11,"['Eric Prydz', 'EPIC', 'Today', 'Prydz']"

Those lucky enough to see the trio for the first time since their reunion at Ultra Miami 2018 are dying to hear brand new music along with an entirely new production. The group has updated their profiles several times in the past year, each time waking up the world to hopefully catch a glimpse of new music or tour dates. We’ve also seen glimpses behind the scenes in their studio but will have to be patient for anything concrete.Today, each of them have updated their profiles with matching side portrait shots. Axwell, Ingrosso, and Angello now have a simple black and white silhouette shot of themselves as their profile photo. On the official Swedish House Mafia Facebook page, their profile & cover photo were also updated with the same shots. If you remember, these photos are identical to the silhouette shots posted after their press conference last October.We can see these photos being used for visual effects during their live shows or even for an album cover. In the past months, the trio have meticulously used social media to tease fans with upcoming tour dates and music.

"The booming voice behind house classic “Everyday” and Chicago-native singer Kim English has died.According to a post from her label Nervous Records it was confirmed that she had passed. The label reminisces about her singing and songwriting talents. In addition, they discuss her devotion to her religious roots and family. Nervous Records gave fans insight on how she would tackle records.“When you look at her body of work, and read the song titles, you start to understand that while she knew she was making music for people to dance to, she also made sure she was imparting positive messages and lessons through her music,” Nervous Records wrote.No details as of yet have been given on how she passed. Nevertheless, it’s a sad sight to see such talent move on. With high-energy anthems, such as “Unspeakable Joy”, and “Treat Me Right”, her impact on the genre won’t be forgotten. “Without question, she had more great work in her, but we will have to be satisfied with the beautiful music she blessed us with……….” wrote Nervous Records.Fans flocked to social media to give their condolences.Kim English was incredible. I have been absolutely in awe of her voice since she started to release music in the 90s. It was a dream to be able to work with her in any context one day, and I felt honoured that we made it happen last year. You are irreplaceable.

"My thorough Ultra Music Festival 2019 review is coming shortly, but as I was preparing it something important occurred to me. Obviously Ultra’s 21st edition has to be judged in comparison to its previous location at Bayfront Park. Many people slept on Ultra and never attended the previous venue, so now all they have are internet comments to read. As I scoured the interwebz during and after Ultra 2019 I noticed that suddenly Bayfront Park had become THE perfect festival venue. When did this happen?Certainly the venue was unique and iconic. If you lived in Downtown Miami then Bayfront Park was a very convenient location for the festival, but what about if you stayed in Coral Gables or South Beach (or further)? Did people suddenly forget the major downsides with the venue? So I decided our Ultra review needed a prologue to remind people that Bayfront Park was FAR from the perfect venue you’re reading about on Facebook today. In fact, many people attending Ultra and within Ultra itself wished they could be rid of the constraints of the tiny venue far before Miami kicked them out of Bayfront.All of the problems with Bayfront Park stem from this huge limitation. Bayfront Park is 32 acres, and Ultra snags a little bit more by closing off sections of road for the Megastructure and Worldwide stages. EDC Vegas sits on a property that is 1,200 acres. The property where TomorrowWorld was held was 8,000 acres. You get the idea – Ultra Music Festival hosted almost as many people per day as Tomorrowland with a tiny fraction of the space. There was 0 room for growth, and things had to be taken away to make room for the crowds. This limitation affected every single aspect of the festival.In Bayfront Park you were in a constant state of immense crowding. No matter what stage you were at or where you were walking, you were in a tight space with a lot of people around you. This started literally from the beginning of each year when a massive line would form at the security entrance on Friday afternoon. People lined up to enter would end up in line for over an hour, being pushed around the entire time. Often times the line was so long that early acts would be cancelled or moved later because nobody made it inside in time to see the openers.Nowhere was this issue more prevalent than at the mainstage. Anytime after 6pm the crowd was massive, and you needed to strategically plan where you would stand to avoid being overcrowded. If you wanted to go to the right side of the stage you had to walk through the huge crowd all the way to the back and go around, then walk your way up to the front pushing through people to get there.Similarly the Worldwide stage was always packed to the gills. Even VIP was too crowded and people who paid thousands to get VIP would be turned away or forced to wait in line since it was at capacity. There was no escaping it by walking away from the stages either, the concession areas were packed as well – and there were no tables to sit down and eat at either.Having been to EDC Orlando, Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld, SMF, and Ultra, only at Bayfront Park did I regularly encounter intense pushing in the crowds. With such limited space there was nowhere to move, but that wasn’t going to stop some people from getting a good spot. So there you were shoulder to shoulder with people when suddenly the entire crowd around you is pushing in one direction. Then somebody starts to push back in retaliation, and you better hope you don’t get claustrophobic or overheated. This type of thing was a regular occurrence at the mainstage at Bayfront Park. Whenever Ultra booked a buzzworthy Sunday closing act – you knew a huge battle was coming if you planned to come from another stage to see the closing set. You had to leave very early to beat the crowd and the pushing that came with it.For those complaining about the shuttles, they might forget that after Ultra ended at Bayfront Park each night there was a massive crowd that would form around the exits. These massive crowds again would be full of people pushing toward the exit that was not yet even opened – because parts of the road had to be closed off first.  Then more crowds and pushing would form at the metromover stations, and at the CVS/Walgreens across the street from the festival, or anywhere in close proximity.Here’s the biggest thing people seem to forget about Bayfront Park. The overcrowding and the pushing quite frequently caused literal stampedes. In 2013 when Armin played ASOT 600 in the megastructure there was only a small pathway down from the Live Stage ampitheater. This small pathway had railings on either side, yet hundreds of people began pushing to get down there for the start. A literal stampede occurred and it’s no wonder nobody got hurt. In fact, in 2014 a stampede through the gates of Ultra trampled a security guard causing brain damage and a major lawsuit. The stampedes have always been extremely dangerous and obviously a miserable experience for anybody involved.Does anybody remember when the free waters station consisted of a literal hose on the ground next to the mainstage? And do you remember how bad the lines and pushing were to get water from those “water stations”? Sure the Live Stage worked well for bands, but for artists like Virtual Self and Tchami b2b Malaa it really took away from the experience.It took Ultra close to 10 years of iterating at Bayfront Park to fix many of the problems it had, and yet the problems of crowding and pushing were never going to be solved. For many people that was enough to keep them away from Ultra altogether. While Virginia Key had its issues in its first year, try to remember that Bayfront Park had significant issues as well.In comparing Ultra 2019 with years past, stop romanticizing Bayfront Park so much and you’ll realize the potential that Ultra has at Virginia Key. Bottom Line? With time Ultra can be a vastly better festival at Virginia Key than it ever was at Bayfront.",articles11,"['Bayfront Park', 'Bayfront Park', 'Bayfront Park', '–', 'SMF', 'Sunday', '–', 'Bayfront Park', 'Armin', 'Sure the Live', 'Virtual Self', 'Bayfront Park']"
"With Tomorrowland creeping closer and closer on our calendars, we are hanging on every announcement they have for us. Today, a BIG one – the locations of the Tomorrowland UNITE satellite locations for 2019. Unveiling of the four locations gave us the next cities for the one-of-a-kind event: Athens, Malta, Porto, and Barcelona.The Tomorrowland UNITE events are separate satellite parties in these specific cities. They connect a live stream of the main stage performances, known as The Amicorum Spectaculum. Each city will be setup with their very own “main stage” setup, providing the feel that attendees are at the Belgium-based event. The light shows and special effects are synchronized with the live show in Boom. Tomorrowland specially curates the artists that will appear for these UNITE events.Last year, in addition to Malta, Tomorrowland UNITE connected with seven total countries. These included Abu Dhabi, Italy, Lebanon, Mexico, Spain and Taiwan. The satellite events were immensely popular, and often received shout outs from the main stage acts. The live screen would cut to the party in each city, connecting with the visitors on the holy grounds in Belgium.Check out the full reveal video below!

"SoundCloud’s mobile app is finally getting a brand new user interface that’s long overdue. The new streamlined configuration will benefit all app users, but artists will especially appreciate the small details implemented. In a blog post today, SoundCloud pointed out some of the key features creators can utilize to expand their global audience.The old profile page layout for artists felt outdated and difficult to navigate. It also had limited options for creators to show off their brand, top tracks, and biography. In their new design, the user interface has greatly improved. Artists will now be able to showcase their biography, profile photo, header image, and a ‘pin to spotlight’ feature. Now less cluttered, only relevant user data will be front and center for followers and new listeners.Underneath one’s profile picture, it now shows how many followers an artist has, along with how many users they follow. At first glance, the new profile page looks oddly familiar to an Instagram or Twitter profile page. The main portion of the profile page will then showcase an artist’s ‘Top Tracks’, followed by ‘Latest Tracks’ and ‘Playlists’. Last but not least, a share button has been added, allowing users to easily share profiles and specific tracks they enjoy.The SoundCloud app update rolls out to IOS devices starting today. Unfortunately, there has not been any statement regarding when Android users can expect to take advantage of these new features. Let us know how you like the new update and if it was worth the wait!A little self-promotion never hurt nobody 🤳🏼 With our new profile design on iOS, you can maximize your presence and connect with your fans in real time.

"Ten years ago, Axwell, Steve Angello, and Sebastian Ingrosso released the song that effectively marks a decade of Swedish House Mafia. This was one of their earliest tracks together under their individual names. And even today, “Leave The World Behind” still remains one of most iconic pieces of dance music to ever be written, considered to be one of Swedish House Mafia‘s greatest.The track was originally released as the second single from the trio in collaboration with fellow superstar DJ, Laidback Luke. Owing to its masterful production, Leave the World Behind became one of the most talked about tracks of WMC 2009. And some might even say this was the true start of Swedish House Mafia as a super-group.Even now in 2019 “Leave the World Behind” stands the test of time unlike many other tracks of its age & even calibre.

"This is why we can’t have nice things guys. Getter got his start in EDM with your typical rage-bro dubstep headbanger music, and hey there’s nothing wrong with that. Over time he decided he wanted to mature his sound a bit and get out of that box, but some of the fans just weren’t having it AT ALL. A few weeks back we told you that fans booed Getter during his Visceral tour show because it was not back to back bangers like they wanted.Now the bad attitudes of some fair weather fans have taken their toll on Getter’s well being. So much so that he’s cancelling the tour altogether. Taking to Facebook, he made the raw and sad announcement.It really is a shame that artists who completely sell out their music to teeny-bopper sing alongs *coughcoughzeddcoughcough* continue to be celebrated, but artists that try to elevate their sound are harassed to this extent.

In this digital age of streaming, it’s hard to know sometimes what is legitimate and what isn’t. Views on a live stream aren’t always what they appear to be. Most of the artists who played at Ultra Music Festival this past weekend have started uploading HQ versions of their sets to their own channels. This means that they’re immortalized on the internet for us to replay as many times as we need.In the wake up this mass upload, one artist is calling some people out. In a now-deleted tweet, Oliver Heldens accused many big names buying fake views. “Buying fake views on DJ sets to get noticed easier?” part of the tweet read. “This year again I spot (big) DJs doing it…” He claims it’s easy to spot with the view/like/comment ratio.He named no names with his tweet. When someone asked why he didn’t call them out, he stated “Cause it’s not always their own fault. Might be their mgmt / digital people who push it through.”What are your thoughts? Obviously, view-botting is a thing that happens all over the internet, but is it as big a problem as Heldens claims? When you watch a live stream, do you always like and comment? It’s hard to say.Buying fake views on DJ sets to get noticed easier? This year again I spot (big) DJs doing it. What’s ur opinion on this? I refuse to participate in this, cause people r not stupid, it’s very easy to recognize the fake views (view/like/comment ratio), so why do people do this??— Oliver Heldens (@OliverHeldens) April 3, 2019",articles11,"['Views', 'Oliver Heldens', 'Oliver Heldens']"

With the Himalayan mountains as his backdrop he posted a beautiful photo with this quote in the captions:From the footage, it seems as though it was definitely worth the trouble. First of all, the training for this type of endeavor is quite daunting. Second, the dangers that come with climbing a mountain that has taken so many lives is intimidating.

Along with that, the wonky synths and upbeat sample come together to bring that underground house music vibe. Although, the sound is reminiscent of late-2000’s electro or fidget house. With Beatport recently adding a bass-house category to its website, it’s pretty safe to say those genres are having somewhat of a renaissance.Overall, ‘‘ definitely will be in the setlist for DJs looking to get the dancefloor jumping.

"Ultra Music Festival did not exactly have the best first-year at Virginia Key. It all began Friday night when the festival’s bus shuttles left thousands stranded forcing attendees to walk miles. The surrounding Miami residents complained about loud music and terrible traffic delays. However, people very much enjoyed the new venue and all the additional stages. There were many happy reviews by the end of the weekend. Now the question becomes, will the city of Miami let Ultra stay at their new location?The city gave Ultra a revocable licensing agreement that allows either the city or the festival to cancel the deal within two months of the event. The organizers want to stay, but there’s a chance the city does not. Ray Martinez, Ultra’s chief of security, addressed the media about the weekend. He had this to say about Ultra’s future:“It was a great event in a beautiful location, and we look forward to being here next year and producing — and even improving on — our event and our festival…It’s a net benefit for the city,”Mayor Francis Suarez and other officials will meet with Ultra representatives this week to discuss what went wrong and what worked with the festival. He already believes putting 50,000 people on Virginia Key is a bad idea- as seen when Ultra botched the first day with their chaotic transportation system. They came back strong the second night and showed they can fix their problems. Ultra made adjustments on the fly and were able to create a more memorable experience for ravers.More problems they will have to address are noise complaints and terrible traffic. Miamians complained about the noise volume but more specifically the bass. But, music festivals need their bass so we don’t think they can fix that one. All the surrounding residents talked about the awful traffic. Shuttle buses were driving aggressively. People were walking on the roads. Cars were stacked up one after the other. That is certainly something they can address and fix for next year.So will Virginia Key be a 1-year stint for Ultra? Or will they make it their home for the years to come and write it down in history along with Bayfront Park? Only time will tell.",articles11,"['Virginia Key', 'Bayfront Park']"

"Miami’s Ultra Music Festival sadly came to a close this past weekend but it’s not too early to start planning for next year. This year, Ultra made history in Virginia Key for the very first time, producing a memorable show with such little preparation time. From an amazing main stage design to the one and only Resistance Island, each year greatly builds upon itself.This year also marked Ultra’s 21st birthday but brought on new challenges at their new home. With around four months of preparation time, it was expected that there would be a few bumps in the road at a brand new location.

However, their tweet left out any details if the event would stay in Virginia Key.Yes, the first night of the festival saw a less than ideal transportation system but by the next day, they were able to address and resolve many of the issues. By 2020, Ultra will have had plenty of time to thoroughly organize game plans to avoid the problems they encountered this past weekend in their new home.Nonetheless, all festival goers need to know is Ultra will take place March 27-29 2019, in Miami.

It found that  became less likely to eat or reproduce when the song “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites” played.A music-on and music-off environment was created to study the species’ foraging, host attack, and sexual activities. Researchers noted sound is crucial for reproduction, survival, and population maintenance in many animals. However, in insects low frequency vibration noise disrupts the perception of signals from conspecifics and hosts. For Skrillex’s breakout single, it did just the trick.In a music-on environment, they were less likely to visit hosts and attack. They also copulated less with their counterparts. Blood feeding also appeared lower in this environment. In a music-off environment, none of this happened. Now, this type of mosquito is known to carry a multitude of diseases. These findings could help develop ways to prevent mosquito-carried diseases, which could be a revelation.The key vectorial capacity traits to electronic music could provide music-based personal protective and control.It looks like music isn’t for everyone, folks! Who knew that there was a song that couldn’t make you function. We sincerely apologize to the mosquitoes that have fallen lame to our head banging father. Contrary to the popular belief that dubstep brings out your animal instincts, we cannot speak for these little buggers. It seems its dissonance is detrimental, not influential.The abstract for the study is available now. You can read it here.

After three days straight of dancing, raging, and singing to everyone’s favorite songs, it’s sad to say Ultra Music Festival has come to an end. While the festival production and artist lineup was top notch this year, the overall planning in terms of sound bleed and transportation proved otherwise. In Ultra’s defense, problems like these were to be expected considering the new venue move to Virginia Key Beach Park. While taking long walks staring at the Miami skyline was nice, the additional cardio to get off the island might have been too much for some.Despite the hiccups here and there, Ultra is all about good vibes, making new friends, and finding new music.

Then there were the problems with the shuttle service to a  breaking out.  A spokesman from Ultra said that after reading comments on the Ultra Music Festival (Official) Facebook group, they came to the conclusion that this year the festival had lost its vibe. Keeping all this in mind Ultra has indeed decided that it is time for a full revamp for 2020. The official statement said:We feel that  LA has the vibe we lost. the legal marijuana in California will contribute to much better vibes and particularly less complaining on Facebook.This unexpected turn of events is great news for the folks over at Rapture who were left homeless this year. Rapture hadn’t yet secured a contract for Virginia Key when Ultra swooped in and took the venue for 2019. The result? Rapture 2019 was no more.

"We’re nearing on the anniversary of Avicii‘s passing and, honestly, it’s still hard to believe he’s gone. His legendary performance at Ultra 2011 introduced us to the future of dance music, which is why this year’s UMF was going to be particularly hard for everyone. But something special happened. On Saturday, March 30th, Korean-based graffiti artist Royyal Dog spent a good portion of the day creating a mural that touched everyone’s hearts.He spray-painted an impeccable black and white portrait of a smiling Avicii wearing a backward ball cap, one of his signature looks. This was the Tim we knew and loved. He also included the white lotus flower found in the ‘‘ music video. At night, the painting came alive. The blue hues contrasted the monochrome beautifully. It is truly a work of art. You can see the final product below.  Rest in peace ◢ ◤ you gave us the flower(*the MV of Levels).Everybody in the event miss you so much. .

"One of the most talked about topics this year is whether or not Woodstock‘s highly anticipated 50th anniversary festival will actually happen.Michael Lang, co-creator of the Woodstock Music & Art Festival in 1969, claims that the festival will still be taking place despite numerous hiccups. He says that “it’s going to be a blast.”Lang, a longtime concert promoter, recently released a statement confirming that he and Woodstock LLC were “committed to ensuring that the 50th anniversary of Woodstock is marked with a festival deserving of its iconic name and place in American history and culture.”The hardworking team behind the festival has undergone several bumps in the road. This has included a hold on ticket sales, performers leaked ahead of the lineup announcement, and, more shockingly, a major financial investor dropping out of the event.“Despite our tremendous investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners and attendees,” Dentsu Aegis Network’s Amplifi Live said in a statement.You can read the full statement from Lang and his team below.",articles11,['Woodstock']
"Moby, also known as Richard Melville Hall, has revealed an incident involving President Donald Trump, that we really wish we could unhear. The American producer and DJ, has been fairly active on social media, showing his discontent for President Trump. He even went as far to say that he’d move to Canada if President Trump won re-election in 2020. We’re giving a preemptive warning, the event Moby described, is a bit disturbing.“I think I knob-touched Donald Trump.”In his new memoir, t, Moby admits that while at a party back in 2001, he had brushed his penis on Donald Trump. Yes, it was intentional as Moby stated he and his drunk friends were bored. Trump, at the time, was working in real-estate and likely had no idea what Moby had done, even to this day. Here’s a snippet from Moby’s memoir, describing the event in his words:“I drank a shot of vodka to brace myself, pulled my flaccid penis out of my pants, and casually walked past Trump, trying to brush the edge of his jacket with my penis. Luckily he didn’t seem to notice or even twitch.”We’re not sure why Moby thought it was a good idea to brag about what seems to be sexual assault but then again, at least he’s open to moving to Canada. Also worth noting, there doesn’t seem to be any regret from the artist, as it sounds like he’d do it again if he could go back in time.

"Burning man currently finds itself in the middle of a standoff with the U.S federal government with its future at serious risk. The problems started when the event’s organizer, Burning Man Project, applied for a permit from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to hold the event in northern Nevada’s Black Rock Desert for another 10 years. The BLM responded by issuing a draft of the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) required for the permit on March 15.As per the draft, the BLM wants 10 miles of concrete barriers installed on the event’s perimeter for security. Another requirement says that organizers install dumpsters and hire companies to haul out the trash. They also require authorities to be in place to conduct vehicle searches at the gate. Predictably this decision didn’t sit well with Burners & the BLM alike. The Burning Man Project wrote in a fact-checking statement about the decision:The BLM encouraged Burners and their supporters to submit comments to the agency by a Monday deadline.Unlike most festivals Burning Man is a “Leave No Trace” event (hardcore burners hate the term “festival”). Here, “camps” form their own communities for a week, share resources and create art together. In the end, there should be no evidence of what happened and the land is supposed to be returned to a cleaner state than before.Burning Man has been around for nearly three decades. However, the last few years have seen an influx of hipsters, ‘Instagram influencers’, tech moguls and their followers. Collectively they’ve transformed the event into a cultural phenomenon. Thankfully the conditions of the permit won’t affect this year’s event, which is slated for Aug. 25 to Sept. 2. However, it could potentially derail next year’s event.This ongoing tussle with the government has taken some longtime Burners by surprise.Franklin says he knows that it might be hard for some non-Burners to understand why trash cans are an issue.The government also has concerns about lights being used at night. These include large work lights, high-intensity lasers and searchlights. This according to the BLM can disrupt birds and other wildlife and contribute to light pollution. As a result, the proposal to ban or drastically cut down some of the lighting fixtures is on the table. But the Burning Man Project isn’t having any of it. They addressed the issue in their fact checking statement:The organizers categorically deny that the night lights affect the local fowl population. “In fact, birds are rarely encountered on the playa in hot summer months,” they said. They also call the idea of vehicle searches at the gate “unconstitutional” and unnecessary.",articles11,"['Nevada’s Black Rock Desert', 'Burning Man Project', 'Burners', 'Burning Man', 'Burning Man', 'Franklin']"

In a press release from the family, they stated that the foundation “His family also said:Avicii’s death shocked the world and brought newfound attention to the serious mental struggles he was navigating through as an artist.

"The Tybee Island Police Department had arrested the promoter of Orange Crush on felony charges along with city ordinance violations pertaining to promoting an unpermitted event. As a result, all events… https://t.co/k6rbMQ2lmJ— Tybee Island Police (@Tybee_PD) April 27, 2019On its surface, the Orange Crush altercation is a he-said-she-said scenario. Essentially, the local government says reaching out to festival organizers was fruitless. NBC News outlet WSAV in Georgia is reporting that the city’s March contact attempts via written correspondence got no response either. In response to that, festival organizers expressed their willingness to cooperate with local authorities. However, reports coming out of Tybee Island seem to reflect a total breakdown in cooperation. Furthermore, actions by the local police show a reactionary halt of all the Orange Crush activities. Maybe, they didn’t want people to get, “Fyre Fest-ed.”What’s unusual here is that the announcement of the cancellation of Orange Crush came from the government and not the event organizers. Typically, those types of statements are the responsibility of the entity hosting the event. Regardless of the reasons for a cancellation, the government rarely boasts about its interference with the private sector. Additionally, the local community hadn’t expressed a desire for the festival’s cessation but merely desired more communication and enforcement. WSAV’s report on Orange Crush seems to back this up. Not to mention they reported the police department ramping up safety precaution efforts as recently as Friday, April 26th. Check out the video for yourself:On the outside looking in, it may appear that this Orange Crush situation is one big misunderstanding. Although events experience some hiccups each year, permits usually aren’t of issue. Besides, an event that’s been going on since the ’90s should have all of these details worked out. On top of that, rumors were swirling of MTV being in town to document the festivities. There’s no possible way this could all be a hoax, right? Wrong.In Fyre Festival fashion, the organizers of Orange Crush were gassing up the attendees the entire time. The event promoter, Mikey Turner was into some felonious activity too. According to the Chatham County Sherriff’s Office, he’d been unlawfully selling tickets (we’ve heard that before) to a house party promoting the event. Comically, he was arrested at the party after a noise and parking ordinance complaint. Fox News reached out to the Tybee Island Mayor’s office in response to the promoter’s arrest and got this statement:",articles11,['Police Department']
"One Toronto bar is fed up with it’s customers for one very odd reason. It’s not because of violent or rude behavior towards staff but for simply refilling water bottles in the bathroom. You’d think staying hydrated would be encouraged but this bar reportedly stated this is ‘beyond staying hydrated’. To combat the water thieves, the owner has placed a sign in the restrooms, basically asking for customers to purchase water instead.A spokesperson from Bunker, the name of the establishment, described how massive lines would form near the restrooms, all to refill discarded water bottles. Supposedly, the lines caused distress and chaos throughout the night. Legally, bars are required to provide cups of water for free, but they also sell water bottles for $4.50. Why aren’t the customers being praised for their good deeds towards the environment?Overall, it all comes down to money and how the business can make enough of a profit each night. If people aren’t buying drinks, the bar won’t be able to adequately support their staff. Looks like you’ll either have to purchase water or sneak it in like most of us do at the movie theater. Then again, it’s not like anyone will get arrested for continuing to refill bottles in the restroom.Let us know if this bar going to far, just to make a profit, or if you’re on their side.  hydration shamingA post shared by  Holden Levack (@doldgold) on ",articles11,['Holden Levack (@doldgold']

"With everything over and done, Coachella still remained hot in topic last week as TMZ reported a massive herpes outbreak linked to the festival. TMZ cited, “a huge spike in folks looking to get treated for herpes” from HerpAlert, an app for diagnosing and treating herpes. The news was big enough to catch the attention of the Riverside Public Health Department, as public information officer, Jose Arballo, has come forward to deny any evidence in the rise of recent records. “I reached out to our lab departments, disease control and our HIV and STD program and none of them reported a spike in herpes cases,” says Arballo.Initial reports showed that the app had a steep rise in inquiries made on the HerpAlert app, jumping from 12 people per day to 250 during the first two days of the festival. HerpAlert has since clarified that in addition to users inquiring about herpes, many others were coming to the app for medication to treat and prevent flare-ups. Neither of these directly equate to newly diagnosed herpes or mass outbreak.Dr. Jill Grimes, a board-certified family physician, was also quick to debunk the claims, “It can take anywhere from two to 12 days for symptoms to appear, although the average is three to four days.” While it is not uncommon for large events to see an increase in cases, a 10 to 20-fold spike is suspiciously high.Whether it was a marketing scheme for HerpAlert or not, it surely got the internet talking about this—and no press is bad press.",articles11,[None]

With massive LED screens, visuals where a pleasure to see. Childish Gambino, Tame Impala, Ariana Grande, Khalid, Zedd, J Balvin, and many others performed at the biggest stage of the festival.The Outdoor Theatre, the second biggest stage, saw a mixture of headliners and second tier artists. On this stage DJ Snake, RÜFÜS DU SOL, Bob Moses, Gorgon City, BASSNECTAR, Billie Elish, Gesaffelstein, and many others performed. This stage’s main feature, just as the Coachella Stage, was big LED panels that allowed for visuals to be seen splendidly.The Sahara stage, which in prior years was EDM heavy, saw a mixture of hip-hop and EDM. Acts like Dillon Francis, NGHTMRE, Jauz, Anna Lunoe, Gryffin, Diplo, Kayzo, Kid Cudi, YG, Pusha T, and many others performed here. This stage is a megastructure with a bunch of LED panels and a massive sound system. This stage keeps developing every year and it is nothing short of grand.Yuma Stage was where all the house and techno fans headed to get away from the heat. Acts like Cirez D, Camelphat, Chris Lake, Nicole Moudaber, Tale of Us, Charlotte de Witte, and many others performed on this massive tent. Filled with lasers, a disco shark (yes, you read that right), A/C, a bar, and good vibes, Yuma was definitely the place to be if you are into techno and house music.Additionally, stages like the Sonora, Gobi, Mojave, and the Heineken House saw a rotation of different genres. These are smaller stages compared to the previously mentioned ones. These stages saw acts such as Polo & Pan, FKJ, Jauz (Heineken), CHVRCHES, and many others.The hidden gem next to the Sahara stage, Do LaB stage, was the place to be. If you are an aficionado of electronic music then this was  stage. It was a great place to cool off due to the stage design and the mist hoses shooting into the crowd. People here put their phones down and danced like there was no tomorrow. With a versatile lineup of electronic acts, the Do LaB stage was always packed. Surprise guests each night included Camelphat b2b Gorgon City, Agoria, Guy Gerber b2b Pete Tong, Major Lazer, Bob Moses, RÜFÜS DU SOL (DJ Set), SOFI TUKKER, Yotto, Nina Kraviz, Jan Blomqvist, Four Tet, Dusky, and Tale of Us.Coachella saw several surprises during sets. The biggest ones being Selena Gomez, Ozuna, and Cardi B for DJ Snake’s set (Weekend 1) and Kid Cudi bringing out Kanye West (Weekend 2). Marshmello showed up as a guest for Khalid and CHVRCHES (Weekend 1). Khalid, apart from Marshmello, brought massive guests including Billie Eilish, Halsey, Normani, and John Mayer. Ariana Grande, in spectacular fashion and with some hiccups in the audio, brought out NSYNC and Nicki Minaj for weekend 1, as well as Justin Bieber for weekend 2. Tame Impala, the headliner for Saturday, brought out A$AP Rocky for weekend 2. All in all, part of the fun of Coachella is seeing surprises during sets, and this year it did not disappoint.Coachella was an incredible festival. From the jaw-dropping art installations to the incredible versatile lineup, the 2-weekend festival had it all. The experience is like no other, regardless if you like the lineup or not. Everyone comes together under the desert sun to party, dance, and have a great time. Like any festival, it has its ups and downs. This festival is worth the trip and no matter your music taste, you will find a place to dance until your body can’t handle anymore.

"When it comes to creating passwords for all of the accounts we use, we tend to stick with something simple we can remember. If the passwords are simple for us to remember, then they are undoubtedly simple for a pro hacker to manage as well. Many of us who have chosen popular artists like Blink182, Metallica, Eminem, Slipknot, and 50cent for our passwords, are especially at risk. The UK Government’s National Cyber Security Center has added passwords like these to a global password risk list seen HERE.Using your favorite artist or song name as your go to password is probably one of the worst decisions you can make. Not only do thousands, if not millions of other people around the world use that password as well, but they take seconds for a hacker to get through. Think about it; if you constantly post and retweet about Blink182 on your Twitter, a hacker can easily assume you might use them as one of your passwords.Some of the other commonly used passwords that should be avoided include: 111111, Ashely, Michael, Tigger, Superman, Password, and 123456. Shockingly, it was reported that there were over 30 million hacked victims who used 123456 as a password. Honestly, 123456 is the worst password we’ve heard of and don’t understand how anyone could feel secure using that.From now on, try to create a unique password that has as many characters and symbols as you can for every site you use. Avoid popular musicians and names, no matter how huge of a dedicated fan you are. They will understand! Lastly, take advantage of your phone and computer’s password saving system.

"Marshmello is no stranger to the limelight, but his recent collaboration with Chris Brown and Tyga in “Light It Up,” has been garnering some unfavorable attention. In addition to public dissatisfaction, CHVRCHES, who had previously teamed up with Mello for the track, “Here With Me,” has also come forward to denounce the producer for the collab.The Scottish band originally took to Twitter to express their disappointment.“We are really upset, confused and disappointed by Marshmello’s choice to work with Tyga and Chris Brown…We like and respect Mello as a person but working with people who are predators and abusers enables, excuses and ultimately endorses that behavior. That is not something we can or will stand behind.” – CHVRCHESSince then Chris Brown has lashed out in response. Commenting on an Instagram post he wrote “BUNCH OF LOSERS. these are the type of people I wish walked in front of a speeding bus full of mental patients. Keep groveling over you own insecurities and hatred. IM BLACK AND PROUD. AND I KNOW ITS HURTS THAT U GUYS ARE STRUGGLING WIT LIFE OR PEACE SO U ARE FORCED TO SEE MY SUCCESS. You aren’t even #2 (REMEMBER 2nd place only means YOU LOST FIRST! TA-TA. GOODDAY PEASANTS”Of course, Chris Brown’s lengthy history of violence needs no explanation. In 2009, the world was mortified when pictures of his then-girlfriend, Rihanna, had surfaced severely beaten in his hands. The singer has since continued to collect assault charges. Most recently, Brown has been arrested on suspicion of aggravated rape in Paris. As for Tyga, his name was really pushed into fame after he started dating his now ex, Kylie Jenner, who was only 17-year-old at the time. Tyga has also been entangled in allegations of exchanging sexually inappropriate messages with a 14-year-old girl.For reference, lead singer, Lauren Mayberry, has always been vocal regarding social issues—including those reflected on the #MeToo movement—so it comes to no surprise that she would take a public stance.While, in the world of showbiz, no press is bad press, and Marshmello has yet to come forward with a response.pic.twitter.com/oAjbgGf1ef— CHVRCHΞS (@CHVRCHES) April 25, 2019",articles11,"['“We', 'Marshmello’s', 'STRUGGLING WIT LIFE OR', 'GOODDAY PEASANTS”Of', 'Brown', 'Lauren Mayberry']"

There are so many ways this song slaps, and Garrix is proving to be incredibly adept at producing different genres with the EDM umbrella.

"Coachella has come to a close, leaving most with lifelong memories and excitement for next year. Unfortunately for one attendee, her night at Coachella went terribly wrong after a freak accident. During the Gucci Gang performance held at the Sahara Tent, one of the hanging set decorations fell into the crowd. The globe decoration itself was made of thin plastic but the metal bracket attaching it to the ceiling caused harm.“There was a lot of blood and panic set in after that”.Several witnesses, along with the group in the same area where woman was struck, described the incident as surreal and terrifying. The woman, named Caroline, was happily dancing with a group of friends before the incident. It was also reported from her friend Kristen Messih that this was Caroline’s first music festival she’d been to. Another person effected from the falling prop, managed to record right at the moment it fell into the crowd. In the video below, his phone is knocked out of his hands, leaving those around him in a sense of panic.At the moment, Caroline is still in the hospital recovering from her injuries. The metal bracket caused a skull fracture, brain bleed, and a concussion. Thankfully, the falling bracket did not cause any immediate fatal injuries, as the height of the drop could have resulted in far worse circumstances. Additionally, we’re grateful for those who rushed to find medics as soon as the accident occurred.This entire ordeal put a damper on many festival-goers’ weekend and overall, could have been prevented with more detailed inspections during the build. Coachella already faced an unfortunate death from an employee who fell from a rooftop during construction. A statement from Coachella has not been released as of now but we wish Caroline a speedy recovery.Here’s the video that Kyle got when the balloon fell on him and that girl…..you can hear everyone screaming for help as it’s laying on the floor and gets picked up by someone else. #Coachella2019 #SarahaTent #PropAccident pic.twitter.com/9bqRMU3B5z— Scrambled Haigs (@SHOWme_theGOODS) April 23, 2019",articles11,"['Caroline', 'Caroline’s', 'Caroline', 'Caroline']"
"The “Prince of Darkness” Gesaffelstein just took the title to a whole different level. With months of planning and a visit to Surrey NanoSystems, the prince basically created infinite darkness on stage. Using a material known as Vantablack, which is the darkest black in the world, his team was able to construct a set nobody was prepared for.The monolith Gesaffelstein stood in front of was covered in the very rare, very expensive Vantablack. This design erases all visible features on a 3D surface, making objects very disorienting for the brain. Then, to truly boggle the viewer, the monolith would split into two, revealing a lighted surface. Seeing infinite darkness right next to light blows our minds even thinking about it.As Ben Jensen, CTO of Surrey NanoSystems, explains: “When you see that nothingness with light around it, your mind can be quite confused, and your perception of things like depth is severely challenged.” Apparently, this was why Gesaffelstein’s set took place at twilight, which is when the contrast is the best for viewing.Here is a scaled drawing of the monolith that was covered in the Vantablack:As fans pointed out, it was absolute madness trying to figure out what was going on. Here is what one Twitter user had to say about the performance:This is exactly why we were sober and thought we were trippin balls lol amazing @sarahduffyyyy @naomi__noelle @magoooz21 https://t.co/bW7sbnPcho— lil em🐇 (@emilyatks) April 17, 2019Who says you need to alter your mind with anything else at a festival?

"DJ and producer Rodg has had major success with his music since he’s been producing. He is now signed with Armada Music and has had the support of some of the biggest DJs in the world including David Guetta and Martin Garrix. We visited the Armada office in New York last week to chat with Rodg about his newest album called “Fate” and many more fun facts including what inspires him. Check out the full interview below!You just released a new album called “Fate”. Can you tell us how everything came together? Rodg: I like to work in album projects because they combine all your records in a really nice way and then tie everything together. You can combine it with a tour and all that. I also like about the album project is that it’s always a show to the world, it’s always a part of my life that I’d add to the album because this is a, you all 16 records or 18 records that I worked on for the last one and a half to two years ever since in my previous album with Ruben. Obviously not every record I made made it to the album. But when I think like, okay, I have enough records to make it a little bit more of a story when you listen to it as a whole.How long did you spend on any one song? Rodg: I can have some done in a day. That’s a really good, yeah. But it can take up to three weeks too, or maybe even longer or I make some part of it or maybe the melody part or baseline and then I’m so out of creativityYou mentioned earlier you can combine album release with other things such as a tour. Is that something you plan on doing?Rodg: Album tour is right now. This is my first stop into the United States when it comes to term touring. I’m going to be back in June here in New York. It’s super exciting. Melrose, Melrose ballroom in New York on June 15th. It’s going to be a daytime rooftop event. I think it’s going to work really well in the summer. Fingers crossed for nice weather in this hour.You’ve had a ton of support from so many huge DJs such as David Guetta and Martin Garrix. How does that make you feel in terms of these huge DJs supporting you? Rodg: People like that supporting me, that’s like the biggest motivation for me to make music because the recognition you get from guy. So I look up to four already so many years in play my record, it’s amazing, you know, and I like playing shows and play my music for people and they go crazy on it.Were you there to see the song play live or how did you hear about it?No, no, no. I was asleep and I woke up and Twitter exploded and Reuben texted me like, Rodg, Guetta played your track at the show. Like, oh my God. You know, by then I was already producing music for seven or eight years. So yeah, that was just life changing moment for me.Now that you’re a successful producer, what do you do to give back to the community of aspiring producers? Rodg: I feel right now that I’m in a comfortable position after, well, 12 years of making music that I’m am able to give back a little bit of the experience I had myself and I do that with the demo drop. I did that. We had a fader Procor music production tutorials or lengthy a armada university. I did two courses with them and permanent record a little more. I just like to give those kids a little bit of my own experience in that and what I also always tell them, if I can do it, you can do it. You just need to put the effort in and then you can do it because, you know, I have no musical background whatsoever, but I just love it more than anything in the world and believe then I can get it done. I’m just walking proof of that. Anyone can do it. ",articles11,"['David Guetta', 'Martin Garrix', 'That’s', 'David Guetta', 'Martin Garrix']"

"Amidst the haze of 4/20 and Coachella a new collaboration was teased between three unexpected artists. In a ten minute span, Martin Garrix, Macklemore, and Fall Out Boy all took to social media posting an image with the same caption. On each of the artist’s respective posts, the words “I got this feeling on a Summer day” are posted as the caption. This could not have happened by coincidence.I got this feeling on a Summer day pic.twitter.com/PYsHWYUKUv— MARTIN GARRIX (@MartinGarrix) April 20, 2019Luckily, as of today, all artists have confirmed that their new collaboration ‘Summer Days’ comes out Thursday. This could be the summer hit of 2019, but who knows. Martin Garrix shared a short sonic snippet to YouTube. What we can gather is that Garrix has prepared a heartwarming vibe for radio play.Sounding a bit romantic, the song seems perfect for summer. It also seems as though Garrix is making good on his collab promises from earlier this year. Seeing these artists get together can only mean good things.

This past weekend, Ariana Grande had an Easter treat for Bieber fans. Justin Bieber joined her on stage to close out her headlining Coachella performance.Surprisingly, Justin’s appearance on stage was not planned whatsoever. Ariana told the crowd:The two then proceeded to perform a duet for Bieber’s hit single ‘Sorry‘. This certainly came as a wonderful surprise for all in attendance seeing how he has not performed publicly in over two years. Earlier this year, he claimed that he would be taking a break from the industry to work on “deep rooted issues”.After finishing the performance, Justin told the crowd that a new album would be coming soon.Fan taken video of Justin performing ‘Sorry’ with Ariana Grande at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California.

"It has been a year since the tragic death of Avicii (Tim Bergling), and the music world continues to mourn this horrible loss.According to an article from Swedish journal Dagens Nyheter, a new Avicii biography will be released in 2020 on the Albert Bonnier Publishing Company. Journalist Måns Mosesson will be the primary author of the biography. Mosesson is known for his raw article titled, “Tim Bergling thought his new songs were the best he had written”. For a breakdown of this article, click here. Mosesson has promises an honest portrait that doesn’t shy away from the difficulties that Time experienced” which he believes “many of his generation will recognize”.This in-depth biography comes after the previously released documentary, “Avicii: True Stories”.“Avicii: True Stories” was the first indicator of the struggles that Tim Bergling was going through as an artist, and in his day to day life. This upcoming biography will likely provide deeper insight into both his and his family’s lives, and answer some unknown questions. In a Reddit stream, one user stated the following:Avicii and his family’s share of the revenue from the biography will go to the Tim Bergling Foundation, which will focus on suicide prevention and mental health awareness.",articles11,"['Tim Bergling', 'Tim Bergling', 'Tim Bergling', 'Reddit']"
"The Him have had countless hit tracks over the past few years. While we were down in Miami, we had the opportunity to stop by the Spinnin’ Sessions event and chat with them about upcoming projects as well as the time a shooting occurred outside a frat party they were playing at. Check out the full interview below.Can you talk about what you guys have planned coming up in 2019?The Him:
We have a lot of new music coming out. We spend a lot of time in the studio and doing writing sessions all over the place, in L.A., Sweden, in our studio in Amsterdam. And like you said, we like to try different things, different types of music. It’s always centered around a song that we like. Or that we’ve written L.A. or something like that. There’s a lot coming. Next release will be on the third of May. It’s called Family Album Spinning and you’ll see it.How do you guys usually determine your release schedule, is it kinda like every couple months or how?The Him:
It’s like we try to release every two months like a single, a remix, so yeah we try to release every two months, or a single, or a remix.Do you find that when you are inspired to write, it kind of happens all at one time or sporadically or you’re always kind of consistently making new tunes?The Him:
The writing is just we do like at least 4 times a year, we go to LA to have 4-week writing session. And like when we are back from tour, we work in the studio nonstop. The production is pretty much constantly when we’re not on the road. So, we try to keep making stuff anytime.Gotcha. Any big shows not even down the road, any big shows for this year, coming up?The Him:
Yeah man, yeah. We’re going to Asia right after Miami Music Week, we’re playing Omnia in Bali, we’re playing Creamfields in China. We’re doing Kaaboo festival, and Hangouts Festival in America.Do you guys have any, big collabs or like people you want to collab with? That you’re allowed to say?The Him:
We’re always working on new things. We’re fans of most different types of music, and obviously it would be funny, not funny, but fun to work with some of those people. At the end of the day, we love cool sounds and great voices, so that can be anybody for us. It’s funny because I think our inspiration for the music doesn’t really necessarily come from the music that we play or make. And it definitely happens a little bit, you know, we definitely love house musicIn terms of genre’s going forward this year, are you trying to focus on any one thing or is it still kind of do a little bit of this, a little house?The Him:
I think we’re trying to focus more on house music, but then every once in a while something else comes out. I don’t know where it comes from. It’s happening right now, we’re working on this song, I can’t say the name yet, but, we’re working on this song and we’re like, ”Yup this should be a house song.” We’re going to do a house song. It’s just pulling us in a different direction.What’s the craziest thing that has ever happened while you DJ?The Him:
Last week after it happened we said to each other: ‘now we finally have really good stories’. It was pretty crazy. While we were playing, I think the last ten minutes for set, there was a shooting going on right? We were playing at a frat party somewhere in the States, it was a great party, well organized, then all of a sudden like ten minutes before we were done, like the guys that own the frat house come with us these texts on their phone apparently there is this automated system and everybody has got to go to the fucking basement and there is a shooting going on. Turned out some fucking idiots got drunk in a fight. Back in the end, we were in the room and they were knocking on each other’s doors because the police were checking out if the shooter was over there. It was fucking crazy man.Do you play a lot of smaller shows like that as well, on top of your big shows to go around?The Him:
Yeah. We try to reach out to all the fans in frat parties but also smaller clubs, bigger clubs, big festivals, like if they are in then yeah we love to do it all, you know? In the end if the energy of the party is great, we have fun they have fun, so.How does it work with both of you guys DJing?The Him:
We fight. We play back to back. We play one song at a time and then he takes over and then I take over.Is there anything you guys wanted to promote or talk about? The Him:
Check out our new song Tell Your Friends out on Spinning, Spotify, YouTube, anywhere you want to listen to it. It is a great track.",articles11,"['The Him', 'Asia', 'Spotify']"
"Ushuaia confirmed the July 26 show with tickets going on sale tomorrow April 25 at this link.The second shoe is about to drop for Swedish House Mafia, as some long anticipated shows are about to be announced.

According to those “in the know” in Ibiza, Swedish House Mafia will play Ushuaia on July 26 with an official announcement on Wednesday May 24.Now that we know additional Summer Swedish House Mafia dates are on the table, isn’t it curious that Tomorrowland is announcing its Phase 2 lineup this week?

"This past March, we saw the famous Ultra Music Festival play out in its new home of Virginia Key, just outside of Miami. The festival provided both positives and negatives, with the latter weighing particularly heavy with the folks of Virginia Key. From the residential disruption, to the transportation disaster, it seemed as though Ultra couldn’t catch a break. Well today, we add another tally to the list of road bumps for UMF.Yesterday, the Virginia Key Advisory Board met and voted on the state of Ultra, voting that the city of Miami “revoke its license agreement”. Importantly, this is a show vote ahead of the real vote that Miami City Commission will hold on May 9. This comes after the Key News published a study that showed marine life suffered significant stress levels due to the loud music from the festival. The study tested hormone levels of the fish and results showed that the stress levels of the fish caused by the loud music were greater than if the fish were being chased by a predator.BREAKING: Fish suffered excess stress levels because of loud music at the Ultra Music Festival, according to University of Miami researchers. Testing of hormone levels showed stress levels were greater than if the fish were being chased by a predator.#Ultra— KeyNews (@KBKeyNews) April 23, 2019
We can all agree that damaging the surrounding environment of Virginia Key brings the drawbacks to new heights. Ultra proved that they can solve their issues, as they quickly fine-tuned their transportation issues after day 1.However, the significant damage caused to the marine life cannot be overlooked or taken lightly. Outside pressure from the Mayor, along with parents of MAST Academy (a prominent school in Virginia Key), also add to the adversity Ultra is facing. The two parties voiced their opposition to renew Ultra to the Advisory Board.With the recent vote against the renewal of Ultra’s spot at Virginia Key, the vote now moves up to the City of Miami Commissioner’s Office to vote on the future of UMF at Virginia Key. This vote will take place on May 9.If the vote does pass to not renew, Ultra finds itself in the same predicament as last year. Does Ultra try to go back to Bayfront Park? Do they leave Miami all together? Let us know what you think. You can also check out the Key News Tweets with all the updates below.2/ Tests were made on fish at the

"Normally steering clear of controversy and drama, Zedd seems to have found himself caught in the brunt Olivia Culpo’s NFL ex’s attacks. It was just last week that reports showed Culpo dancing cozily in Zedd’s arms during Ariana Grande’s set at weekend 1 of Coachella. News travels fast and it clearly caught the attention of her most recent ex, Detroit Lions’ wide receiver, Danny Amendola.Amendola went onto Instagram in a since-deleted post to rant about his ex and her new man, “Not sure what’s in the future but the only thing I care about is her HAPPINESS. And if that’s dancing with scrawny little f*cks, so be it.”He proceeded to try to set the record straight over the weekend by explaining:“What I meant to say yesterday was that the media and general public have no idea what goes on behind closed doors…I don’t participate in fake intangibles that consume the public eye. I’m a private, single guy and if everyone’s happy — I’m happy… Fake people have an image to maintain. The real ones just don’t care.”Culpo and Amendola broke up late last year. Meanwhile, in Zedd fashion, he has continued to avoid public drama and has not given any response to the recent events.

"It seems like Lane 8 is always releasing new music. One quick peek at his Soundcloud page confirms that, too as every month he’s got something fresh and new for the fans. This month is no exception as his latest release ‘Avoure‘ just dropped yesterday. With festival season in full swing, the track is hitting the airways not a moment too soon.‘Avoure’ comes at the perfect time as it seems like the more melodic aspects of EDM are back at the forefront of the industry. Progressive giants like Above & Beyond, Armin Van Buuren, and Alesso, are getting off to great starts already. This is perfect for Lane 8 as he has some pretty big dates of his own ahead. The ‘This Never Happened Summer Gatherings‘ (TNH) kick off later this year.‘Avoure’ comes with that rock-solid production you can expect from any Anjunadeep release. As with every Lane 8 production, all of the synths, percussions, and melodies are wound perfectly together within the song. The summer festival vibe is strong in this one, however. It’s definitely the perfect song to bump while poolside at the hotel as you pregame with the homies.Listen to ‘Avoure’ below and be sure to grab your copy of the track when he releases the final edit.

Similar to the disciples, we have been waiting for a resurrection. Our boy, Sonny Moore, aka daddy Skrillex, has laid low for a few years. He took a much-needed break to re-center himself and enjoy civilian life. Back in February, he denied rumors about an upcoming album, and since then he has dropped a few collaborative singles. He performed at Ultra with boysnoize as Dog Blood–an epic set btw– and there have been rumors about collabs with Diplo and Shaq. All of this has left us restless for more. And finally, this Easter weekend, he broke his silence. Been taking long time off working on my friends albums but more importantly myself. Been lots of rumors of an “album”. I don’t know what it is or what to call it….— Skrillex (@Skrillex) April 20, 2019But I’m about to start putting in this new work , going full speed ahead , no turning back— Skrillex (@Skrillex) April 20, 2019But this is just the warm up— Skrillex (@Skrillex) April 20, 2019We’ll admit it’s a little vague.

"Facebook never ceases to amaze us! The social networking site always seems to be improving its user’s experience, whether it’s by working with algorithms or by offering the opportunity to customize profiles.Speaking of which, we’re all quite familiar with the “featured photos” tool that you can customize on your profile, however, back in October 2018, Facebook disclosed that one of Myspace‘s most beloved features might be coming into play very soon.Recently, Facebook took select accounts on a trip down memory lane to bring back the ability to add a track to one’s profile. Myspace’s musical feature was designed to auto-play the single, however, Facebook’s borrowed idea still remains a tool in which you must select the song in order to hear it.Although most profiles still don’t have this customizable option, we are looking forward to the day that we get to see this tool integrated for all accounts. Which track would you feature, and why?To find out if you have this feature, you will need to go to your Facebook profile and scroll down below the featured photo section in order to find out.",articles11,"['!

"While we were in Miami, we stopped by the Spinnin’ Sessions Pool Party and had the opportunity to chat it up with up and coming DJ and producer, Mesto. We talked about new music, touring and even the time he DJed with a tampon up his nose… Check out the full interview below now!You recently just put out a new song, can you tell us more about it and what was the steps you took to produce it?Mesto:
I have a new song and it’s called Layla. I was a little bit afraid when I released it but eventually it’s good to do some different stuff as well for me personally. I got the vocal and that was like 108 BPM or something so it really was slow, and I just did my thing around it. No rules. Literally, I got the vocal and made everything around it, so I love to work like that, but I need to learn how to record vocals with someone when I already have an idea.Do you foresee yourself continuing in this kind of thing, or is it just kind of one time?Mesto:
Maybe sometimes, but of course I have a lot of club tracks as well, because that’s what I do. I would like to take another journey sometimes to another style or something, but yeah I just want to do everything, just around the club stuff.Do you feel like it’s hard for you to focus on any one genre when you kind of make it all?Mesto:
No, because I have so much house tracks that it’s just nice for me to do different stuff. And house music for me, I have been doing it for four and a half years, so I know how to approach it, it’s so fun.What kind of music do you usually listen to and draw inspiration from?Mesto:
Well, personally, my Spotify playlist is full of just really quiet, chill music. I like really unknown artists. Vivio is really chill music. Guitar stuff. John Mayer. He’s another one. Just stuff like that, I like to listen to it because I’m in house music so long when I make it, I just want to listen to someone else. Coldplay I love their approach to chords and stuff. They have a trick where they have two notes overlapping, but it’s possible, and I love that type of things.What is your mentality when you release tracks? Are they usually on every couple of months?Mesto:
It’s weird, because I used to have not that many tracks lined up, so when I released a track I would have nothing to release after it, so I had to hurry and make something new, but right now I have so much that we planned for the whole year, I had two really good months where I was really inspired, and I make seven new tracks or something like that.What’s one of the craziest things that has happened to you while you were DJing?Mesto:
Okay, so I have one story. I think it was two years ago. I was playing, it was really hot. Really cool festival, vibe was great, and then suddenly my nose started bleeding while I was playing. It was horrible. I know this because it were dripping on the CD tape, it was horrible. It was like, the MC, it was a woman. She had a tampon. Then she stuck it in my nose, and I continued DJing. Since then, I always bring tampons.Do you have tampons in your pocket right now? Did you ever find why? Were you just going so ham that your nose started …What’s your show schedule coming up? What are you playing to?Mesto:
We confirmed a lot of shows already, right now we have forty already for this year. I was a lot in Asia in the last year, I’m gonna do that this year as well. The three shows in Japan and China, Bali, Vietnam, but also Cyprus, Paris. Everywhere, and this is my first time in Miami, so it’s really cool. I just played at Spinning Sessions and tomorrow I’m doing Tiesto’s show in the LIV.What’s your background with Mike Williams, were you guys friends before being on tour?Mesto:
We are friends already for six years or something. Maybe longer. We played at the same party in my hometown, a small venue where Martin Garrix started as well. We’re always sending our tracks to each other and ask for feedback still.",articles11,"['DJed', 'Vivio', 'Tiesto’s', 'Mike Williams', 'Martin Garrix']"
"As the Swedish House Mafia 2019 World Tour prepares to kick off, we are finally learning a bit about the material we will hear on the tour. Oddly enough it’s not new Swedish House Mafia material we’re learning about, but a rework of one of their classics.Composer Jacob Muhlrad announced on his Instagram that his symphonic interpretation of Swedish House Mafia‘s ‘One‘ will be premiered on May 2 at the tele2 Arena as the tour kicks off. The track will apparently be a staple of the tour, being featured at every stop along the way. Reportedly Ingrosso reached out to the composer for him to make this symphonic rework, and both parties are extremely excited about how it turned out. You can read more about this at Dagens Nhyeter but it’s locked behind a paywall. In any event we’ll keep you posted when we get a first listen on May 2.   Idag blev det officiellt att jag går in i ett samarbete med @swedishhousemafia Swedish House Mafia!

It features a choice phrase with the “Y” in You” utilizing his logo for his Pryda label. While we have no idea what inspired this sentiment from the usually reserved Prydz, no doubt it caused some waves on social media.Eric goes by his own drumbeat, and perhaps he was sending a message. Believe it or not, this was official merch at one point way back when. However, fans are already clamoring for it, asking when it will be available again in his merch store.

"After dropping his Big Bang EP and the super dope “stoner anthem” remix of Three Six Mafia‘s “Where’s Da Bud” a few months back, Phulti is back with superb new Chillstep vibes. This time, Tyler joined forces with the very underrated Kyle Maynard, or better known by his stage name Universe City. Kyle released the fabulous Oscillate EP last year, and I say underrated because, although the EP went a bit under the radar, it is a masterful composition that would please fans of the likes of Porter Robinson, The Chainsmokers or in fact, any fans of Future Pop. Together, the two producers blended their own unique flavors with Kimberly Meadowlark‘s outstanding vocal to create the deep and mesmerizing “Ceiling Shadows”.The track has a fantastic old school Chillstep feel, it really brings back the good old vibes that Zeds Dead, Adventure Club and the likes made famous. You know, the sounds that were killing it at music festivals before Future Bass took over the EDM scene and stole the spotlight. Well, if you are like us, I’m sure you missed that sound too and today is your lucky day, because Phulti and his partners are delivering some real top-shelf Chillstep music!“Ceiling Shadows” has a dark and mysterious immersive feel, it really brings that melodic bass flavor from the dark side, it has hints of melancholy and breaths of hope, it is not your rainbows, candies and unicorns type of EDM. The bass line is intoxicating and Kim’s angelic vocal is simply perfect for this type of ethereal ambiance. The track is fluid, the melodic arrangements have a vibrant yet hypnotic flavor, overall it has a musical aura that will absorb your attention and take you “down the rabbit hole” before it breaks the ceiling and let’s you free.Follow Phulti on:

"A brand new EP has just arrived on Wakaan. The freely creative label (run by producer and DJ Liquid Stranger) has been releasing some incredible material over the past few months. As an example, the brilliant Sanctum from TLZMN is no different. One of those artists who likes to keep his identity under wraps, there is no doubt that his music speaks volumes. His sound is cleverly designed to “represent musical fulfillment and rebellion” and nothing is held back within this collection. And out of the seven tracks, you can expect some high-flying D&B and some super slick hip-hop foundations. Opening with “No Obstacle,” the vibe is powerfully immersive and crisp. From here, TLZMN moves into an almost
neuro-inspired “Blackout,” which stretches out with deep melodies and plunging
low-end thumps. “The Pendulum” audibly swings with an array of select samples,
expertly matched and pitched. Again, like “Blackout,” the fast tempo
and aggressive riffs of “Battle Drums” make for an eye-catching combination.
Beginning to loosen the intensity, TLZMN moves into “Deuces,” before easing us
into the penultimate offering, “Rewind.”Completing this EP is “Lithium,” which has a blend of vocal snaps and spiky melodies – the best way to close out proceedings. Giving us a glimpse into his thought process for Sanctum, TLZMN explains: “To discover, compose and create in a world immersed in darkness, one must derive true intention through the darkness from powers within. Most honored, our Sanctum within. Sorcery is actualized when self-awareness is formulated, guarded and developed.”With such a developed production style and fizzing creativity, it’s clear TLZMN has another big year ahead. We are already looking forward to future releases and collaborations. Make sure to stay connected by keeping an eye on his socials. You can find this EP through Wakaan, or stream it right here.

"Right on time for the launch of his fantastic new album “Solar Nights” (that you can stream at the bottom of the article) and for his hit single “Northern Nights” to reach 10 million plays on Spotify, we had the chance to catch up with the outstanding Indie Dance / Nu Disco music producer from Germany Satin Jackets. We asked him a few questions about his career, his inspirations, his thoughts on the Indie Dance / Nu Disco scene and much more. Check out our interview with Satin Jackets below and also peep his new album under the article. Enjoy! 1 – After producing House music for many years, how did your journey into the world of Disco start for you? I felt House music started to become too limiting for me. I like chords, melodies, and full vocals. So when I came across the emerging Nu Disco scene, it felt like a revelation.2- Who is your biggest inspiration/influence? There is no one single entity that I could put my finger on. I was hugely influenced by 80s music obviously, but when the 90s hit with Nirvana, Lenny Kravitz, and Red Hot Chili Peppers, I let my hair grow long and embraced that as well.3 – What do you personally consider to be the incisive moments in your artistic career? As Satin Jackets it was “You Make Me Feel Good” and all the funny calls I had afterward. Then, getting involved with Eskimo which resulted in the release of the debut album. Follow that with “Northern Lights” and developing new friendships with the Norwegian management. Last but not least, “Solar Nights” is already a big milestone for me.4 – What single night out has been the most memorable for you? As a DJ? As an attendee?Playing at Rex club in Paris in 2001, pretty early on in my career as a DJ, before Felix Da Housecat. Apparently, Laurent Garnier was also present they said.5 – Tell us more about your mask? Why did you decide to wear one? Who made it? What is the story behind it?The story is simple: Let the music be the only star.6 – What do you usually start with when preparing for a DJ set?Literally, I start with the first track. It has to set the perfect mood and immediately get people interested in what else is to come. Then build on without a single moment that lets you out of its grip.7 – What advice would you give to aspiring Disco producers?Do your homework, learn your skills, don’t assume your first tracks will be the killer ones unless you really are a genius.8 – Where do you think the Disco scene is heading? One year from now? Five years from now?Looks like the hype has quieted down a bit but there will always be people attracted to the spirit of Disco. Some will still discover it for the first time, some will grow tired, and some will stay true. But eventually, there will be a new trend. I wonder if it will be called Nu Nu Disco. At the end of the day, music is reflecting the fashion cycle and circling back to its roots eventually.9 – If you could eternally be stuck in one year’s music scene, which year would it be?Probably somewhere either in the early-80s for disco or second half of the 90s for House Music.10 – If you could collaborate on an instrumental with any artist (alive or dead), who would it be? Someone from ABBA. Benny or Bjørn11 – How is the Disco scene in Germany? Compared to the rest of Europe or North America?The Germans are initially a bit unsure as to how to treat a gig – is it a concert and they stand back and are only spectators, or is it okay for them to dance?  After a track or two, it evolves into the same party that you see anywhere else in the world.  The music always wins out in the end!12 – What is your opinion regarding the difference between old school DJing where everything was restricted to vinyl and modern DJing where most tracks are never put on any physical medium before or after release?I don’t think the skills of a good DJ should be reduced to his or her mixing abilities. A big difference with vinyl though is that you actually have to prepare your set and decide which records you want to take along. That makes it necessary to think about the venue, audience and what you want to play to get them going. Also, playing with actual vinyl is much more fun than CDJs or USB sticks. The haptic experience beats it all.13 – What is one track that never gets old for you no matter how many times you hear it?Whirlpool Productions – Disco to Disco in an endless loop. “Sing it Ladies”!14 – Which singer would you really like to work with?Someone from ABBA. Agnetha or Frida.A huge thank you to Tim for taking the time to do this interview with us, I hope you enjoyed getting to know SATIN JACKETS a bit more!

"Coming in hot right now out of Quality Goods Records is the incredible “Cups Up” from Sliipow. Based in Indonesia, the bass duo has built up a stellar reputation over there. Due to both DJing and producing, they have played out at Bali’s Ultra festival and won Battle DJ competitions with their fast-paced sets. And now putting a focus on production, Sliipow bring us this wicked little cut. Actor, singer, author and photographer Langston Hues joins forces for a vocal contribution. There is much to enjoy throughout. Without going hell
for leather at the start, Sliipow get you hooked with a steady, meandering
melody and some well-placed pauses. As you settle into its dark energy, out
come the drops. Langston Hues’ vocals are a sharp, commanding force here,
somehow mimicking the rugged bassline. Strong beats and flurried percussion complete “Cups Up,” which we foresee being used as a call to arms on the dance floor. Its low vibrations and pulsing energy mean that it seems to filter through the speakers effortlessly. Talking through this powerful release, Sliipow says: The awesome Quality Goods Records has “Cups Up” ready for release now. And it’s hot, so make sure to stream a copy here. Follow EKM.CO on:

"The queen of Midtempo Bass, REZZ, might have some serious competition for her title, because Australian electronic music producer, rapper, singer, songwriter & DJ, VNCCII, is dropping some seriously next level Midtempo Bass music. Her latest opus, the monster original track “CITIZEN A.I“, is here and you are not ready!“CITIZEN A.I” has an enigmatic dystopian atmosphere, the ambiance is futuristic and mysterious, imagine if an EDM track was produced by an A.I overlord, well, this is pretty much how we imagine it! With absolutely devastating drops, this is a track that will break rails all across the festival circuit. I can’t imagine a Midtempo DJ set at a festival in 2019 without playing this track, it is a must-have track for any fan of the genre.While it has a truly brutal and raw feel, the sound design and the arrangements are impeccable and super polished. The song also delivers a satisfying evolution and strucutre, always making the listener wonder what’s coming next and wanting more! The staccato effect also adds a dope quick “breather” that really reinforces the impact of the riotous drops even more. Overall, “CITIZEN A.I” is a very impressive production that won’t go unnoticed!Here’s a few words from VNCCII about “Citizen A.I”:Meet VNCCII, a young electronic music producer/rapper/singer-songwriter/DJ that has crafted a strong authentic vision and fresh sound palette. She strives to push forward both music and cultural boundaries across a multitude of platforms being music, gaming, audio-visual, technology and fashion. As the line between humanity and artificial intelligence blurs in real time, we march closer toward the singularity.With this in mind, VNCCII has created a 3D cyborg avatar. She is your answer to your futuristic heroine, navigating her way through a Utopian or Dystopian future – an innovative audio-visual project that extends from screen to stage with a fusion of both DJ and live sets.Will A.I be humanity’s answer or is it human nature’s undoing with the imminent threat of the Singularity? Who knows… if she is not conquering the world of Virtual and Augmented Reality, riding the space wave in her Model X, you might just see her appear as a hologram right next to you on stage…Fans of Rezz, Gesaffelstein, and 1778-L, need to absolutely keep an eye on VNCCII.

"So, right on time for the start of the highly anticipated season 8 of Game of Thrones, we have a great treat for you! The super talented Varun, previously supported by Paul Oakenfold, Hardwell, Gareth Emery & r3hab (just to name a few), used the occasion to drop a massive remix of the Game of Thrones song!
We’ve all heard remixes of the legendary theme, after all, it is truly one of the greatest theme song ever composed, thanks to the original composer Ramin Djawadi. However, sadly, most of the remixes were quite disappointing. But good news, Varun‘s take on the Game of Thrones song is an absolute banger! It delivers an invigorating energy that will make crowds go bonkers at music festivals!Varun made perfect use of the main elements of the theme and added a finely-calibrated EDM touch that makes it super intoxicating. The drops have a great Big Room intensity that will surely get the attention of all the biggest EDM DJs in the scene. Expect to see this one in tons of tracklists in the upcoming months!Varun is an EDM producer to keep on your radar. We are looking forward to hearing what other surprises he has in stock for us this year, make sure to follow him on his social networks below!",articles23,"['! The', 'Ramin Djawadi', 'Expect']"
"Australian producer PhaseOne has been making a name for himself over the past few years. With his killer solo productions and hosts of remixes, he’s back with a huge new LP. Transendency is set to shake up the scene in a big way. Released via Disciple, this collection demonstrates an opportunity for PhaseOne’s style to embellish and enhance the other artists on the record. It results in a project that beautifully encapsulates both his technical expertise of and the sheer volume of talent featured throughout. From “Mayday” featuring the vocal stabs and collaborative production of Modestep, to “Crash & Burn” with Australian heavy-hitters Northlane, this LP is packed with intensity and musical dynamo. Talking through the release of Transcendency, PhaseOne says: We can’t wait to see Transcedency on tour, but in the meantime take a listen below! Emerging onto the scene in 2013 with a unique take on bass music production, he founded himself within the Dubstep community. Coming with a range of remixes and unique originals, he formed his own distinctive style. By mixing heavy metal elements with heavy-duty bass, PhaseOne caught the attention of some of the largest dubstep labels. He went on to create two EPs with Firepower Records, then signed exclusively to Disciple records in January 2017. He has since released another 3 acclaimed chart-topping EPs, as well as a slew of viral hit singles.2018 saw PhaseOne set out on his most ambitious project to date, to write a full length album. Now that project has been released – and Transcendency is ready for the world to hear. Follow EKM.CO on: Spotify Soundcloud Youtube Facebook Twitter InstagramLooking for music promotion?

"This new release by AJ Mutated lands on ProgRAM.The UK drum and bass label has had a strong run of recent releases. The younger sister of Ram Records (originally established by scene behemoth Andy C), is all about championing new talent and now they add AJ mutated to the roster. Artists from all across the world are getting a platform to showcase their developing sounds, and we’re here for that. As a result, ProgRAM has just put out two tracks from AJ Mutated. Whilst you may be aware of Mutated Forms, AJ is stepping out of the group’s shadow to produce some solo stuff. He excels with “Bleak/Catch 22,” which offer up different sides to his production. Going super charged in the mix is the former, a dark yet enticing listen. Expect relentless power here: explosive beats and electrifying snarls of melody. On the flip we have “Catch 22.” There is a more drawn-out feel to this tune, and it’s one to roll out on a busy dance floor. No doubt it’s already been road-tested at many clubs. It still moves sharply with synth stabs and marching beats, but has space to expand. AJ Mutated is one part of Mutated Forms, which has become a respected name in the D&B scene. The quality and diversity of Mutated Forms’ collective work is what sets them apart from the rest. Their willingness to stretch through different genres is what keeps their music fresh: from the serenely liquid and euphoric to straight up dirty funk and filthy dance floor destroyers.Follow EKM.CO on:

"Slightly over three months since the release of the amazing “Crusade“ EP, Purple Tea Records is back with Sonickraft‘s latest opus, entitled “Leave Your Body” EP. The EP is literally “fresh from the oven” and is available today exclusively on Traxsource! Both mixes on the EP (the original and the Castnowski remix) are anthemic and yet emotional, upbeat and yet deep, the fusion of Progressive House, Melodic Techno and Tech House has never been so well executed.The intoxicating synth arp melody with the masterful filter work create an incredibly immersive and emotionally powerful feel, something that we usually get from outstanding Trance composers. Add a layer of hypnotic vocal samples and thick drums, and you have a fluid musical journey that is absolutely mesmerizing and blissful.On remix duty, Castnowski kept the essential, the poignant and breathtaking synth arp melody of the original version and wrapped it around some tight build-ups and brilliantly groovy bass-heavy drops. He metamorphosed “Leave Your Body” into a real peak time banger, he traded the emotional depth for a nasty and throbbing bassline, making it a top-shelf remix for heavy banging Tech House sets.The EP offers a good mix of House music flavors. It is a very impressive release from our favorite Canadian Tech House record label. Another must-have DJ weapon!Stay tuned for more, Purple Tea Records never disappoints and they are not showing any signs of slowing down!",articles23,['Sonickraft‘s']
"We had the chance to have a talk with the extremely versatile and talented EDM producer JackEL and we asked him a few questions about his career, his label/collective, his inspirations, his thoughts on the EDM scene and much more. Check out our interview with JackEL below and also peep his latest releases under the article. Enjoy!Music has always been around me personally, and I’ve always really enjoyed the sound/feel and impact. I noticed my interest in creating music at around 8-9 when I first starting picking up a guitar and banging some pots and pans. I’ve always been fascinated with instruments and sounds. I remember the first time I saw an acoustic drum set in front of me, it was so cool, and I wanted to play the drums right then. When I first started finding out about electronic dance music I really loved it and started listening to it more and more. I flooded myself listening to it with friends.At 14 for my birthday I bought myself turntables and I started DJing in clubs that same year because of connections I made around the city of Edmonton, AB Canada. I was DJing in clubs in Edmonton until 15 and then I moved to Vegas and started JackEL upon arriving. It was cool to recently go back and DJ in Edmonton after Christmas 2018. I thought about FVYDID at an old job when I was 18. I was signed to a label and had a manager and it all went to shit. After I had the name FVYDID I was excited to start releasing my friends’ music. I had the knowledge I just wanted to help out my friends. I created FVYDID while still under my old label and manager and they kept urging me to quit FVYDID and stop pursuing it. But I’m thankful I followed my gut and left that old label to pursue FVYDID full time. The goal of FVYDID is to provide high-quality art to the world and get the artists paid so they can focus on their life purpose.Hey thanks, I love being diverse and producing with new artists and doing new genres.Right now I love sad boy rap and combine that with Dubstep. I’ve recently loved vocally performing on my music (rapping/singing) and then adding big drops. I love to produce house and I love to DJ a high energy dance set.I’ve produced many genres, and still, know there is so much more to accomplish. Bossa Nova is one of my fav genres. I just finished off my Spring Bass Tour which had loads of bass haha.Well, when I was just starting out I looked up to Skrillex, Deadmau5, Feed Me, Wolfgang Gartner just to name a couple. I love music in general and draw inspiration from many sources. Now in 2019, there is so many talented artists, and so many solid good sounds. It’s much easier for producers to get their ideas across with easier and higher quality tools at there fingertips. I surround myself with talented producers daily and draw inspiration from my peers such as BOB-O & POZEIDON.Being able to travel off music is awesome, I love connecting with new fans and new supporters. I really love being able to meet new artists with new talents, and I love learning new things musically. This year in 2019 I have released a single on Datsik’s old label Firepower Records and to me, that is so awesome. I already released a single on Deadmau5’s old label Play Records and that is so sick to me as well.Having Deadmau5’s old manager call me and talk to me and tell me she believes in me is enough.Opening up for Afrojack in North Carolina at Grave Diggers Ball was amazing. Probably just acting too soon and not being patient. I personally have MAD ADHD and have to do everything at 100mph. I have screwed up many times because of it and I hope other artists have more patience and understand things take time. The only issue I really see with coming producers is not understanding the basics, the roots, where this all came from. Keeping the audio quality good, mastering, can’t forget about the basics.Also just keep producing, have fun! And try your very best to make income off what you love. If you can make 1000/w or so off your music, you can do it full time, and start encouraging your peers around you to follow suite.  Well, dance music will always stay, electronic elements are being sprinkled in all genres including rock, pop, and hip hop. Drake & Travis Scott are working with Skrillex, and the future will just be everyone’s collaborating with everyone. My sound will always stay true to what I personally love, and my feelings change. Right now I love energy and bass and feeling and melody, and I know the future JackEL will have all of that and more. I will be working with major pop artists, and even budding underground artists. So much music will be released before I can’t make music any longer.Hopefully, 2020 because I know that’s the year where JackEL is going to be DJing many of the major festivals, and major events. 2019 has been so amazing I could only imagine whats next. The music right now sounds great.  Every artist doesn’t get the attention they deserve. The best musicians in their world will never get noticed because there in there parents basement and don’t have any drive or money. The artists with the most drive, and love and manifestation will rise to the top. I don’t think I get the attention I deserve, having 250+ songs out online that all slap. But I know it’s the same for many artists who make quality music but aren’t sure how to market successfully. It’s all about marketing.I love to create music, I love to dance, I love to make people dance. I love to DJ raves, and dance clubs to watch my rave fam all dressed up and going hard for my music. I love watching the crowd come together and hug each other and know that we are all here for the same reason, the music.I mean things bug me about many things in life, but I don’t let it get to me. I’m very positive and stick to that. I don’t enjoy loud distorted music and I don’t want to hurt my ears. I would much rather listen to high-quality music that isn’t so loud and distorted. Most EDM events have over loud music.Any modern kid or adult can become a DJ now with an iPhone. Old school DJing with vinyl is still alive, and those DJs stay true to what they believe. I love scratch DJ’s and it’s an art. I personally don’t see like a Producer/DJ and a scratch DJ even being the same, because they’re performing two different ways.JackEL OnlineFacebook

Having impressed the promoter of Gategrasher while playing at an afterparty in Ibiza, Greg was asked to play at Space the following week. Very shortly afterward, Greg broke through the UK trance scene playing at major shows such as Gatecrasher, Godskitchen, Slinky, Inside Out, Goodgreef, and Passion. What was every aspiring DJ’s dream to travel the world soon became a reality for Greg. He was crisscrossing the globe flying from New York City to Sydney to Ibiza to Shanghai to Buenos Aires to London playing to massive crowds.Greg recorded his first “Live As album” on Discover from the mega Planet Love festival in Northern Ireland, which captured Greg’s energy as a DJ and was featured as “Album of the Month” in Mixmag. Soon the prestigious BBC Radio One came calling and Greg appeared as a guest on Eddie Halliwell’s radio show. It came as no surprise when Greg was voted into DJ Mag Top 100 poll coming in at number 82. This was a huge accomplishment for such a young talent.Wanting to explore the darker side of his sounds, Greg developed his R.I.C.O alias to bring out the deeper underground techno sound. As Greg explains, “I think it’s good to try new things and to develop yourself in the studio, I love growing as an artist and developing,” after receiving great feedback from fans and fellow DJs of the tracks released under the R.I.C.O alias. Game Face and Afraid Of The Dark have been firm favorites of Markus Schultz featuring on his Global DJ Broadcast show several times.

Skullduggery as a label has stamped itself as one of the strongest tech trance outfits in the scene. A brand that prides itself on consistency and quality of the utmost impeccable sonic standards. Built around a handful of standout artists and friends who are known for setting the bar higher, Skullduggery is now a far-reaching family and platform that encompasses a label, live shows, fashion and of course a global community of like-minded people who are at the core of who they are and what they represent.Supported regularly by the likes of Armin van Buuren, Gareth Emery, Paul van Dyk, Ferry Corsten, Sander van Doorn, Above and Beyond, Greg’s many achievements, alongside his outstanding technical ability will ensure he continues to reach great heights.Alex Di Stefano, a producer of over twenty years experience, is bringing a breath of fresh air to the electronic dance music scene with a unique style of techno-trance combined with a large musical knowledge of past and present. It’s fair to say Alex has created a huge impact in a short space of time and is widely regarding as one of the hottest properties within his genre.In 1994 Alex produced the first Italo-dance single under the alias “DayDream” entitled “Thinkin’ About You” which gained major success throughout Europe. A year later came his second single “DayDream – Through The Night”, from this release, Alex gained recognition from the most well-known Italian labels such ‘Next Records’, ‘Red Music’, ‘X-Energy’ and many more!Alex’s desire to try new sounds and experiences did not stop, he decided to give a further boost to his career by moving to Rimini in Northern where he knew he would have many more opportunities such as a new residency. It was here that Alex’s music style evolved to a more techno-trance sound. Alex stood out immediately on the Adriatic Coast, considered by many the second Ibiza, it was here in 2002 when he performed in one of the most famous Italian clubs “Cocoricò”, his performance had the Italian scene speaking his name in high esteem.In less than a year Alex was headhunted to be part of a well-known production team “Digital Team Studio – Rimini” where he worked for 4 years releasing hit records such as ‘Mash – In Your Arms’, ‘Mash – One Day’, ‘Mash – Oak Island’, ‘Mash – Be My Girl’ and many more.Considering his experience as a producer and numerous productions released under different aliases, Alex decided to focus on his career as a solo artist in 2007, starting to release tracks in a more minimalist style which evolved itself to what we call his Tech-Trance Style of today.His diversity as a producer marks a turning point in Alex’s career which has seen him release tracks for many well-known labels such: VII, Armind (Armada), In Trance We Trust, Who Is Afraid Of 138?!, Subculture, Kearnage Recordings, Outburst Records, Skullduggery and many more.Alex’s productions are touching the major labels, producers, promoters and clubbers, getting excellent results in all major digital stores and support from industry figureheads such as by Armin van Buuren, Aly & Fila, Simon Patterson, John Askew to name but a few, not to forget that he joined the VII crew.He has performed for global brands such as Subculture, Open Up, VII, Digital Society, In Trance We Trust, J00F Editions and has played at world-renowned venues such as Tomorrowland, Dreamstate US, Luminosity, ADE (In Trance We Trust), EDC Orlando (Dreamstate Stage), Exchange LA, Avalon Hollywood, The Gallery (Ministry of Sound), Circus Montreal, Koko London and many moreA DJ / Producer with very wide freedom of musical expression, always looking for innovative sounds, following no particular style, only updating his musical knowledge and without ever abandoning atmosphere for a Trance, Tech world that has been hit by commercialism. All this makes Alex a future icon for the electronic dance music industry.Henry and Matthias, better known as Stoneface & Terminal are a dynamic, German DJ duo with a long list of releases and remixes under various aliases, on a high profile labels. Their productions are hammered by the likes of Paul van Dyk, Tiësto, Armin van Buuren, Ferry Corsten, Above & Beyond, Markus Schulz to name but a few, securing a career which has been on a consistent upward trajectory over recent years.In 2004 Henry and Matthias founded their label Electric Department Records and brought up tracks like ‘Merkur’, ‘Sidewinder’ and ‘Summerscape/Miami’. Paul van Dyk chose ‘Merkur’ for his exclusive DJ MAG Mix-CD. Their imprint has provided a home for a number of their side projects including Gundamea and Lichtengard as well unleashing a wealth of fresh and talented acts.After 4 releases on their own label, Henry and Matthias signed to one of the world’s leading trance-labels Euphonic and teamed up with labelmate Ronski Speed to create ‘Incognition / Drowning Sunlight’. ‘Incognition’ received support from the elite and became one of the biggest club hits in 2005. In 2006 ‘Venus’ followed and was chosen by Armin van Buuren for his “A State of Trance” CD-Compilation + Vinyl-Sampler. Also in 2006, the ‘Earth EP’ was released and Giuseppe Ottaviani made a remix of ‘Super Nature’.

Showcasing more unique qualities to their sound, Gundamea’s remix of Armin van Buuren and Mr Probz’s ‘Another You’ has gone to do make its rounds across airwaves with a spin by Markus Schulz on his Global DJ Broadcast.Moving into 2016, Stoneface & Terminal’s continued their impressive studio output, with releases on labels including Perfecto Records, Flashover, FSOE -including Beatport Trance #1 ‘Hypogean’- and many more.

"Yulio is back with his third album, entitled “Earth”, and it is an absolutely hypnotic musical journey! From IDM, Trip Hop, Breaks and Chill-Out, the album is very diversified and offers flavors from a bit everywhere in the Indie Electronic music spectrum.The album is transporting, it is a true musical introspection, the ambiance is trippy and enigmatic, it is one of those albums that you start from track one, close your eyes and let the music penetrate your soul.While the album has an ethereal experimental feel, the sound design is very impressive and fresh, it is finely-calibrated to really maximize the cerebral impact and evolution of the journey.It feels good to experience something unique in the electronic music world, most of the music released nowadays is rarely original nor fresh, way too many producers are copying others’ sound, but not Yulio, his sound is infectious and he delivers a unique atmosphere that would make a terrific OST for a sci-fi movie.Grab your headphones and let him transport you into this deep cerebral and spacial musical journey.Yulio & Kraftoptical are definitely two entities to keep on your radar for quality Indie Electronic, IDM and Electronica music, make sure to follow them on their social networks to stay up to date with their releases.Chilean resident in Croatia, after living many years in Barcelona, he has spent almost 20 years dedicated to electronic music, and now to the most experimental sounds. Everything started in the north of Chile in the year 2000, where he started as a DJ in different events (Upspace). After graduating as Sound Technician in Santiago de Chile, he was one of the musical pioneers in the north of the country where he explored sounds from Techno, House and Psytrance.In 2003, he immigrated to Barcelona where he absorbed and acquired all the wisdom of the city, where in 2006, he created KRAFTOPTICAL.  In 2011, with almost 70 releases of producers from all over the globe, he started editing his own material. In 2013, he produced his first album “Future Elqui”. The album received great responses, especially in the experimental circles of the circuit. Then his “Secrets” (EP) and second album “Contact Interestelar “produced in Australia (Melbourne), introduced a particular spatial sound, with the heart and soul focused on the mysteries of the Universe.With his “astrospacecraft“ EP edited in 2018, he achieved great reactions, especially in his country of origin Chile. Today, he is taking us in new directions with his new album “Earth”.Follow Yulio & Kraftoptical on:

"Detroit’s very own G-REX has produced and released his latest EP, just out through Wakaan. If you caught one of the heaviest bass tunes of last year, you will be familiar with “Babatunde,” which G-REX made alongside PEEKABOO. Following on from the track’s widespread success, G-REX is back with not just a single but four new sounds under the Requiem title. It is clearly a project that the producer/DJ is proud of, and he says: There is no doubt about its aggressive energy. He gets things started with brute force and striking rhythmicality – “Ladi” comes straight out of the speakers stomping. With a little more refined, atmospheric tension comes “Asylum.” No less sinister in its vibe, G-REX takes longer to get to its furious drops and stabbing melodies with an elongated intro. STUCA has been brought into the fray for “Voodoo,” which is gritty and spectacular in equal measure. It’s impossible not to admire the sheer sonic range on display here from G-REX. To signal the end of the EP perhaps is “Warning,” the kind of tune that cuts through a speaker with its thudding, impossibly weighty bass notes and repeated whirs. Requiem really is a stellar addition to Wakaan’s catalogue and if you’re looking for something to immerse yourself in today, this might just be it. Stream it below. Although the origins of G-REX can be dated back to 2015, 2018 was certainly a breakout year for Detroit native producer, Jake Sweeney. As he worked to perfect his brand of high energy trap and bass fused with sinister dubstep sound design, he honed in on a deep dark sound that has become a recognizable signature in his music and earned him the respect and support of leaders in the scene. In September 2018 he released one of the biggest bass music tracks of the year, “Babatunde,” as a collaboration with friend and fellow bass music phenom, PEEKABOO, on Liquid Stranger’s record label, WAKAAN. He then followed up with his debut four track RIFT EP, also on WAKAAN, as well a recent collaboration with Ghastly.  2019 sees G-REX’s first major tour appearance as support on Liquid Stranger’s 36 date INFINITY TOUR January through March, the release of his second EP, and a handful of singles including official remixes and collaborations with major players in the bass music scene.   While many continue to regurgitate the same stale sounds, G-REX is here to usher in a new era of cold-blooded bass.Follow EKM.CO on:

"Dixii has landed his first release, entitled “Falling in Your Arms”, and it is truly a super infectious and accessible blend of EDM, Future House, and Indie Dance.
The track is fluid and so easy-listening, a very versatile track that will have success as much in the clubs, at house parties and also at music festivals.It delivers a super sweet and invigorating energy! The vitality matches the level that Electro House delivers, it has the feel-good and funky aspects of Indie Dance / Nu Disco & Electro Pop, and the masterful vocal chopping work that we usually hear in Future Bass.It is really a refreshing and finely-calibrated House track. It is playful and tender, extremely catchy and overall an intoxicating groove that will make everyone get on the dancefloor.
Dixii is definitely a producer to keep on your radar. We are looking forward to hearing what else he has in stock for us in 2019, make sure to follow him on his socials below!

"With their work getting shown some love through Ram’s 2018 Drum & Bass Annual, the UK duo Mob Tactics have again been picked up by the label. Ram Records ensures that each release they put out is of the highest calibre; “LDN Bass” is no exception. This is an all-out smasher that blisters through any sound system in no time at all. Primed for destroying club floors, it packs a serious punch. The Mob Tactics guys opt for a dominating, sweeping bassline and offset it with those fast shifts and high-pitched vocals. If you caught their previous singles “Dreamway,” “Convoy” or “Bigfoot,” you will know Mob Tactics mean business with their full throttle productions. Ironically, given the fact that
they’ve got “Tactics” in their name, Mob Tactics came about quite by chance.Mark was producing as The Funktion, and Luke, in his role as label manager for RUN DNB, liked what he heard and signed some of his tracks. It became apparent that Mark and Luke’s taste in music was ridiculously similar and, over the course of a few weekends, they decided to get in each others studios and see what happened…Recent years have seen Mob Tactics revel in creative freedom. Releases like the “Body Check EP” and the Ryme Tyme-laced “Tweakers” have demonstrated multiple facets to their sound. Unconstrained by sub-genre limitations, the one thread that binds all their work is that commitment to making ravers move.Anyone who’s witnessed one of their
blazing deejay sets anywhere around the globe will testify to the vibes and
energy Mob Tactics bring to a dance. And, even since opening up their personal
dub collection to the masses with their “Mob Vaults” releases on BandCamp, the
amount of firepower they’re packing on their USBs shows no sign of diminishing.So, this is Mob Tactics. Signed and certified by some of the biggest deejays and labels in the scene, we’ve got a feeling they’re just getting started…Follow EKM.CO on: Spotify Soundcloud Youtube Facebook Twitter InstagramLooking for music promotion?

"As we previously reported, Violent Femmes are slated to join Ben Folds on the road for a North American summer trek. Now it’s been revealed that just days prior to that tour-kick off, the alternative rock veterans will release a new studio album.Dubbed Hotel Last Resort, it’s set for a July 26th due date through [PIAS]. It represents Violent Femmes’ tenth (overall and first since We Can Do Anything from 2016.The forthcoming collection spans a total of 13 songs, most of which feature additional instrumentation from Violent Femmes’ longtime backing band Horn of Dilemma. There are also two covers included — “I’m Not Gonna Cry”, originally by Greek rock super stars Pyx Lax, and a rendition of Irving Berlin’s “God Bless America”.(Read: The 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time)Additionally, there’s a new version of “I’m Nothing”, from the group’s 1994 record, New Times. It comes with new vocals from pro skateboarder Stefan Janoski, a longtime fan who considers the song one of his all-time favorites. In collaboration with Janoski, Violent Femmes have also designed a new Nike shoe inspired by the track’s lyrics.In a statement, the band’s Brian Ritchie called Hotel Last Resort “probably the best one we’ve made since [1984’s] Hallowed Ground.” He added,It’s just a very focused album, the songs all hold together. It’s a classic album, in the sense that people should actually sit down and listen to the whole thing. It’s not too long. It’s short, it’s punchy, it’s solid, it’s to the point, goes a few different directions but it always comes back to the core approach and then it’s over. Hopefully you’ll think ‘I want to hear that again.'”As a first teaser of the new LP, Violent Femmes have let loose the title track, which features Television frontman and co-founder Tom Verlaine. “We didn’t really give him much instruction,” said Ritchie, who first met Verlaine in 1978 as a young music journalist, “but he did exactly what we hoped he’d do. He clearly has an affinity for the song. He must’ve really clued in on the lyrics and he really interpreted them with a guitar.”Violent Femmes’ own Gordon Gano called the joint track “one of the greatest thrills of a long recording career.”Hear it below.Pre-orders for Hotel Last Resort are ongoing.

"Big Thief are set to return later this week with their new record, U.F.O.F.. Ahead of the LP’s May 3rd release, the Brooklyn-based indie rockers have today previewed the forthcoming collection with a final single, “Century”.Keeping on brand with what we’ve heard so far from U.F.O.F. — like the title track and “Cattails” — the latest from Big Thief highlights the group’s inventive songwriting. Laidback and melodic bass and guitar licks intertwine across the song, laying out a strong foundation for Adrianne Lenker’s breathy vocals.In a rare move of cross-network synergy, a handful of radio stations across the United States teamed up to simultaneously debut the “Century”; the song aired for the first time at 11:00 a.m ET/8:00 a.m. PT on KCRW Los Angeles, WFUV New York, WFPK Louisville, WYMS Milwaukee, and KCMP Minneapolis.But you don’t have to tune the dial to hear the track now. Listen in below.U.F.O.F. serves as the follow-up to Big Thief’s last pair of attention-grabbing albums, 2016’s Masterpiece and 2017’s Capacity. In support of their latest effort, the band has added a new show at Brooklyn Steel on October 9th, augmenting the group’s New York City run at Webster Hall on October 10th and 11th. These performances come in addition to an extensive tour that spans from May to November, tickets for which you can grab here.",articles40,['Adrianne Lenker’s']
"The best collaborations don’t make much sense on paper, but exceed expectations in practice. Thankfully, that’s the case for “Lost Without”, a new single that sees disco pop artist Kindness team up with Swedish soul-pop singer Seinabo Sey for a track co-written by R&B force Kelela.“Lost Without” sees a dance-prepped house beat weave between ’80s R&B coos and cascading horns, each giving off the warmth of an idealized jam session. If there’s ever been a call to the dance floor, it’s this unexpected collaboration, which as press release notes was recorded on three different continents.(Read: Album Review: Kindness – Otherness)Kindness hasn’t released an album since Otherness in 2014, but “Lost Without” marks their second piece of new music in two months. In March, Kidness re-teamed with Robyn for “Cry Everything”. There’s no word yet on whether this is all building to a follow-up to Otherness, but given just how good “Lost Without” is on its own, we may not even be ready for a full album of Kindness material that brings a similar heat. Give it a listen below.Last year, Kindness contributed to Robyn’s return album Honey as well as Blood Orange’s excellent record Negro Swan. With a new band in two, they’ll head out on a short tour later this summer. Find the dates below, and get tickets here.Kindness 2019 Tour Dates:

"After spending the last several years chasing UFOs, Tom DeLonge is turning his attention back to music. He’s not reuniting with Blink-182, however. Rather, he’s resurrecting his other band, Angels & Airwaves.Today, DeLonge has unveiled the first new song from Angels & Airwaves in three years, “Rebel Girl”, which serves as the lead track to an upcoming album and feature film project. What’s more, he’s mapped out a 23-date US tour, his first such outing with the band in seven years. Get your tickets here.Not surprisingly, “Rebel Girl” draws inspiration from DeLonge’s recent endeavors as co-founder of the UFO research group, To the Stars. “’Rebel Girl’ is a space-age love song that combines my enduring obsession for New Wave, pop punk and anthemic rock and roll music,” says DeLonge in a statement. “As some of you might’ve heard, I recently took a brief minute to start up an aerospace company, so you never know – I may play this song from a satellite deep in space, beamed toward everyone’s house viciously on repeat.” Take a listen below.The tour kicks off September 4th in Phoenix and runs through early October. DeLonge will be joined on the road by guitarist David Kennedy and drummer Iian Rubin.

"At the start of March, Stef Chura announced her sophomore album Midnight, which is due out on June 7th. Now, the indie rocker has released a new song and music video, “They’ll Never”.Following up the record’s lead single “Method Man”, the latest from Chura highlights the singer’s striking vocals and love of her home of Detroit, Michigan. As she explained in a statement,“I wrote this song while living in a building in Ypsilanti, MI that was not up to code. No one cared about it. The kitchen was moldy, the carpets were dirty, and the house was generally unfinished. This place existed in an odd realm. ‘Sideways from grace the angles lost.’ This means that at a certain angle and in the right light, you can see what is amiss. No one really cared for it, and yet people would go on living in it and subsequently it would be a home. No one cared enough to take care of it and no one cared enough to notice it and destroy it or hold the people who lived there accountable for keeping it up to code.It’s also about looking into the future, that when life hands you less and circumstances aren’t what you thought they were. ‘They sold you love, this chalk’s just dust.’ Wanting something you can’t have. Having expectations that don’t go the way you think they should. How what you bought isn’t in the box and you have to start over. There is only a memory of what is left represented by a shell of what was there. A conversation on how you can never really own anything. And life goes on even if your house is moldy and you don’t speak the same language as the drunk old man you live with who steals your potted plants and plants them in the yard for you. He says, ‘You’re welcome.'”“They’ll Never” has been paired with a dynamic music video that once again draws inspiration from Detroit. You can watch the visual, which finds Chura and her band performing at colorful spaces around the city, below.In other news, the rocker will hit the road this July for an extensive summer tour.

"Bleached returned the other week with “Shitty Ballet”, their first song since 2017. The punk/garage rockers have now announced a new album on which that single is set to appear. Titled Don’t You Think You’ve Had Enough?, it’s due out July 12th through Dead Oceans.The follow-up to 2016’s solid Welcome the Worms LP, Don’t You Think serves as the first full-length that Bleached have “written from a place of sobriety.” Sessions began in early 2018, taking place in both Nashville and their hometown of Los Angeles.“Writing these songs while sober became somewhat of a spiritual experience,” the group’s Jennifer Clavin stated in a press release. “I had to let go, trust the process, and allow an energy beyond my control to be present.”(Read: The 50 Albums That Shaped Punk Rock)With the assistance of producer Shane Stoneback (Vampire Weekend, Sleigh Bells), Bleached have helmed what’s described as their most “courageous” project, one that “radiates the power and bravery of facing addiction. of letting go of the past.”Those themes are already deeply embedded in the album’s latest single, “Hard to Kill”. According to the band, it’s about “staring down the road towards death and realizing I needed to wake up and get out of my selfish patterns of self destruction.”Check out the defiant “Hard to Kill” below via its official video, directed by Juliana and Nicky Giraffe.Pre-orders for the new album are ongoing.

"March saw rising London four-piece black midi offer up “Crow’s Perch”, a single with a seemingly endless number of musical curveballs. The band is back today with “Talking Heads”, which continues to showcase black midi’s appetite for arrangements spiced with jazz, post-punk, math rock and beyond. (Its title is also perhaps a nice nod to David Byrne’s own iconic post-punk group.)“We’ve always tried to make it heavy but danceable, melodic but good rhythms,” Geordie Greep, the band’s vocalist and guitarist explained in a statement. “It is accessible music, there are experimental aspects that we’ve taken from when we went crazy at the beginning, we’ve just reigned it in to make something that is pop music.”(Read: Talking Heads in 10 Songs)Take a listen to the jolting, three-minute tune below.Both “Talking Heads” and “Crow’s Perch” will appear on a double A-side 12-inch next month through Rough Trade.

"Late last year, Banks confirmed she was working on her third studio album, with 45 songs in the can. Now, the American alt R&B singer has released one of those tracks as a brand-new single, “Gimme”, which marks her first release since 2017’s “Underdog”.The dark, hypnotic “Gimme” was debuted on Apple Music’s Beats 1 as Anna Lunoe’s (filling in for Zane Lowe) World Record. Co-written by the alt-pop singer and Buddy Ross, the track also features production from famed producers Hudson Mohawke (Kanye West, Drake) and BJ Burton (Bon Iver, Francis and the Lights).As Banks explained, “‘Gimme’ is a song about getting what you want. It’s about knowing what you deserve, saying it out loud, and demanding it with no apologies.

"Well, we’ve reached peak “Old Town Road”, folks. The viral sensation started its life as a TikTok challenge tune, rose to Billboard prominence, stirred controversy for not being “country enough,” and somehow reignited Billy Ray Cyrus’ relevance (again; the man is country music’s Beric Dondarrion). Now, the track that made a bemusing star out of Lil Nas X has finally made it the stage — while simultaneously going full EDM.Diplo debuted his new remix of “Old Town Road” during this weekend’s Stagecoach fest out in Indio, California. He first welcomed Cyrus onto the stage, and the crowd was more than hyped to sing along with the “Achy Breaky” man about riding till they can’t ride no more. Then out came Lil Nas X himself, and people went apesh*t as the young Atlanta musician made his performance debut.Witnessing a meme come to life in real time is a thoroughly 2019 experience, and seeing it happen with Diplo pressing buttons behind a stack of hay bales and the mother of Miley Cyrus strumming stage right just makes it all the more choice. Take a look below.Diplo has also released the studio version of his “Old Town Road” remix, which you can hear below.

"Origins is a recurring feature that asks musicians to dig deep and explain the different inspirations that led to their newest music.Kate Tempest has announced her new album, The Book of Traps and Lessons. Due out June 14th via American Recordings/Republic Records, the British spoken word rapper’s latest LP follows a pair of Mercury Prize-shortlisted efforts in 2014’s Everybody Down and 2017’s Let Them Eat Chaos.Though her most recent release was only three years ago, Tempest has spent the last half decade working on the tracks found on The Book of Traps and Lessons. That’s when producer Rick Rubin first laid ears on the acclaimed poet and artist during an episode of Charlie Rose. Joining the pair in their journey was Dan Carey.As a first listen to the effort, lead single “Firesmoke” is debuting today. The slow, soulful track sounds how wrapping a soft feather down comforter around yourself and a lover feels: comfortable, quiet, and eternal. That’s right where Tempest seems to be writing from, twisted up in romance. “I bathe in this fire/ It warms without burning/ Compels without force/ And it turns without turning the world,” she intones, like she’s whispering it into the ear of her lover.Take a listen to “Firesmoke” via the track’s lyric video, which Consequence of Sound is premiering below.For more on the love that sparked “Firesmoke” and how the track fits into the record, Tempest has broken down the song’s Origins.A Turning Point:I think of the song like a cleansing moment in the wider context of the record, in the same way that a relationship can be a cleansing moment in the wider context of a life. A kind of a turning point. I wrote it for my woman. Inspired by her and everything that falling in love with her has taught me.My Love:My love is a holy woman. She is a dancer. A singer. A healer. She is extremely sensitive to scent, colour, taste, sound. Her spirit is ancient. She’s sexy as fuck. She drinks champagne, has a shaved head and is going grey. She listens to tragic French love songs with all the windows open. Her origins are Berber and Sufi. She is a very, very powerful woman who loves women. This song is homage to a great, complex, messy individual who changed my life.Album Narrative:The hope for this song is that it lifts the record into the ecstatic. It comes at a precise moment in the narrative of the album and begins the final chapter of the work, the last three songs are where the album moves into what is hopefully it’s redemptive and revelatory closing stage. This song is the beginning of that shift in the album.",articles40,"['Kate Tempest', 'Tempest', 'Tempest', 'Tempest']"
"The National have just wrapped their five-date run, “A Very Special Evening with The National”. The intimate tour saw the band screen their Mike Mills-directed movie, I Am Easy to Find, followed by a performance during which they debuted new material from their forthcoming album of the same name. At last night’s final gig at Los Angeles’ Orpheum Theatre, they were joined by a pair of special guests in Phoebe Bridgers and Feist.Feist has actually been with Matt Berninger and co. for all of their “Special Evening” dates, singing on songs like “Hey Rosey”, “Not in Kansas”, and “Hairpin Turns”, all new tracks off I Am Easy to Find. In LA, however, Bridgers filled in the for the role Julien Baker had in New York City a few nights earlier to perform “Where Is Her Head”.

"Last fall, Daptone imprint Durham Records gave us Black Velvet, the final album from the late Charles Bradley. It turns out there’s more posthumous, previously unreleased material from the Screaming Eagle of Soul.Shortly after being diagnosed with stomach cancer in late 2016, Bradley hit the studio with New York musician and producer James Levy. Together, their sessions yielded a pair of new songs titled “Lonely as You Are” and “Lucifer”. Recorded with backing instrumentation from Seth Avett and Mike Marsh of The Avett Brothers, the tracks were completed with the help of Nashville multi-instrumentalist Paul Defiglia.While Bradley was able to hear the completed arrangements, he died the following summer at the age of 68 before the songs could be properly finished. However, both cuts are now being released so fans can have some of the Screaming Eagle’s final words.(Read: The Top 10 Cover Songs of 2016)The first of these tracks, “Lonely as You Are”, is being released today by Innit Recordings, and it’s as devastating as they come. In addition to being consumed by loneliness, Bradley takes time to reflect on his impending death, particularly during the track’s final moments, which are delivered as a message to his mother and other family members that have passed on before him:“Mamma, wherever you at in heaven
Please, hold a space for me
I’m walking this planet Mamma like you taught me to do
I’m walking. Trying to find you, Mamma
One day, when God says well done
Please, be at the gate waiting for me
With your Momma, Grandma, Rowena Green, J.W. Welch and so many more
I love you and this is from Charles Bradley
Hope this one day gets out to the world”Through his own heartache, though, Bradley hoped to make others feel less isolated in their sadness. “Charles knew ‘Lonely as You Are’ could comfort people and help them find a way to deal with their own loneliness,” Bradley’s former co-manager, Morton Lorge, said in a press release. “He was always looking for ways to make people feel better, even when he was confronting his own pain and suffering. He asked that ‘Lonely’ be played at his funeral; he wanted to share it with the world.”Bradley hoped it would one day get out to the world, and it has.

"Rodeos aren’t just a thing of the past. Not only are they still ridiculously popular, but they’re rooted in strong tradition — which may explain why some parts of the new Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever video are hard to watch.Today, the breezy indie rock act drops their “In the Capital” b/w “Read My Mind” 7-inch single on Sub Pop. To celebrate, they’ve released a music video for the B-side. In the clip, directed by Australian photographer Warwick Baker, close-up black-and-white film captures scenes of a rodeo in an interpretation of the song’s themes. It’s not all rope lassoes and bucking horses, either. “I hoped to observe and document the spectacle of the rodeo, focusing on the performers rather than the audience,” explained the director. “Being a vegetarian, I found the event confronting, but wanted to document the theater and ritual of the rodeo without glorifying or condemning it.”Watch the video below.This 7-inch comes after the band’s lauded debut album, Hope Downs, from last year. With that record, the band brought their low-key Australian sound to a wider audience.Now, the band will see their fanbase face-to-face.

"“Mining Metal” is a new monthly column from Heavy Consequence fixating on noteworthy new music emerging from the non-mainstream metal scene, focusing on releases from small and independent labels — or even releases from unsigned acts.Since Black Sabbath released their self-titled debut album in 1970, metal has grown to encapsulate a wide variety of sounds that, in some cases, haven’t become part of the genre’s mainstream commercial arm. This column isn’t about praising one style of metal over another. It’s about bringing those hidden gems to the surface for wider consideration.We anticipate it will be a strange and stimulating journey, one that will absolutely reward patience and open-mindedness. It might get dark, it might get weird — and it will definitely get loud. This is Mining Metal.It’s easy to forget sometimes just how satisfying a nice lo-fi slab of speed metal can be. Chevalier’s debut LP, Destiny Calls (purchase here), brings to mind those first magical Blind Guardian records before they became the massive juggernauts we know them as today. That same magic is present here, a nasty hybrid of thrash metal and traditional heavy metal. Chevalier’s feral approach slightly disobeys the metronome, as they deliver their songs with both a sense of old school Mercyful Fate-esque theatricality and the heft of early Manowar or Helloween. In a better world, Chevalier would be able to be called power metal and that would be that hewing as close as they do to that early ’80s proto-power mold as they do, but alas, the term has other connotations these days that do not particularly apply to this group. Chevalier offer a test on Destiny Calls: Do you love heavy metal? Do you love it more than you love life? If so: you’re gonna get a kick out of this one. Prepare to chuck chairs through windows thrashing like a maniac and clutching invisible oranges in your living room.  — Langdon HickmanThe briefest possible description for Disparager’s self-released debut album, Existential Dread (purchase here), would be melodic metallic hardcore with post-rock elements, which is a bit of a mouthful but paints the contours of the record as completely as brief genre descriptions can. In terms of bands comparable to the Deftones, Disparager seem a great deal closer than Spotlights [see below], especially in terms of mirroring the core influences of that legendary group, if not precisely mirroring the precise execution of them. Disparager are fans of those wide voiced six-note guitar chords that the more satisfying hardcore bands use, the ones that offer that slightly jazzy melodic slash to cut through the post-hardcore and howled vocals. There’s a fair bit of screamo and alternative rock on the album too, making it a sampler platter of post-hardcore sonic styles. The group pulls them off, feeling at times in the same league as Oathbreaker and Deafheaven for metallic post-hardcore emotional heavy lifting. There are moments where the songs seem to meander, but it’s not hard to imagine this band producing a heavy hitter in the years to come, and the songs here are no slouch while we wait.  — Langdon HickmanIn case Chevalier above wasn’t enough of an indication, let’s be forthright: the Mining Metal team likes traditional heavy metal. Guitar solos, melodic singing, verse-chorus-verse structure, the whole kit and caboodle. Fortunately for us, the style is ascendant in popularity after more than a decade relegated to the ultra-niche areas of the internet. Portland, Oregon, act Idle Hands play traditional heavy metal to a certain extent, but they strongly infuse it with a gothic rock flavor on their full-length debut, Mana (purchase here). Singer and guitarist Gabriel Franco sounds more like Robert Smith than he does Bruce Dickinson, even though one can hear The Cure and Iron Maiden both in his band’s sound, as is evidenced by the song “Dragon, Why Do You Cry”, premiering below. Mana will be released on May 10 via Eisenwald Records. — Joseph Schafer<a href=""http://idlehandspdx.bandcamp.com/album/mana"">Mana by IDLE HANDS</a>Let’s say there are two types of bands inspired by Black Sabbath: the kind that love Ozzy Osbourne’s drugged out “Sweet Leaf”, and the kind that like Ronny James Dio’s epic “Sign of the Southern Cross.” OK, there’s way more than two types of bands that mine that creative vein, but the point is, Toronto’s Smoulder are the latter. On their debut album Times of Obscene Evil and Daring (purchase here), the band draws lyrically and visually from the seminal fantasy of Michael Moorcock and others but still offers much to less geek-inclined listeners. The band exhibits a formidable command of melody, and their songs never drag on too long — a common pitfall in his type of music. Bands like Smoulder live and die by their vocalists, and singer Sarah Ann’s pipes prove as formidable and heroic as the triumphant champion on the album’s cover. — Joseph SchaferSeeing the recent Deafheaven / Baroness / Zeal & Ardor tour hammered home a point to me recently. There is a great deal of music being made right now that is not precisely heavy metal music but is nonetheless heavy and, at times, metal; what matters for it in terms of internal characteristics is its inventiveness and adventurousness, which then is combined at times with metal-as-we-know-it to make whatever new object the band in question is crafting. This same idiom holds true for Spotlights, a band that is at once too dreamy and light and rock-oriented to feel even like post-metal while being at times too heavy and crushing to comfortably be called a rock band. Love & Decay (purchase here) pushes their heavy, dreamy shoegaze approach once more, landing heavier than similar line riders Nothing, but retaining that same level of euphoria. It’s not uncommon to see this group in general and this record in specific compared to Deftones, but that feels misleading; both bands deal with the resolutely heavy and the atmospheric and dream-laced, certainly, but they have distinctive phenomenological affects or, in more normal-people terms, the feeling inside the songs is different even if the parts are the same.  — Langdon HickmanOn their debut album, Seattle’s Theories delivered and inventive and blistering collection of truncated barrages in the vein of Nasum. Their delivery remains fast and lethal on their sophomore LP, Vessel (purchase here) but the addition of a second guitarist has made their songs longer — think eight songs as opposed to eighteen — and altogether darker. The churning album highlight “Lamprey”, for example, sounds like it’s been left simmering in toxic waste for weeks. The songs never get too lugubrious thanks to drummer Joe Axler, formerly of Samothrace, Skarp and Book of Black Earth, who plays with blistering speed and precision only found in the most extreme metal circles. — Joseph Schafer<a href=""http://corpseflowerrecords.bandcamp.com/album/theories-vessel"">Theories &#8211; Vessel by Corpse Flower Records</a>Metal bands specializing in the slow and morose are dime a dozen. Too often these acts focus so much thick guitar tone that they forget to write passages that are memorable or beautiful. On their debut album, A Passage for Lost Years (purchase here), Chicago’s Varaha really emphasize the beautiful part, at times drifting into shoegaze territory or pastoral progressive rock — even the four orchestral interludes prove compelling, rather than throwaway interstitial material. There’s so much to digest that A Passage for Lost Years rewards repeat listening in a way streaming-era records rarely do. — Joseph SchaferI will break my standard decorum and speak in the first-person momentarily. I don’t typically like melodic death metal, an affect I’ve learned over time is more a statement of my taste than the quality of the music. Certainly, there are a few groups and records that I adore (At the Gates and Carcass being the obvious and universal ones) but, by and large, that particular bug hasn’t really bitten me. So it was with great delight that I heard Wormwitch’s new album, Heaven That Dwells Within (purchase here), take a nastier approach, interlacing quite a bit of black metal and crust punk to give the songs a bit of that meaner, gnarlier edge that I typically crave within (non-prog/tech) death metal. At times, the band thrusts with the kind of fervor you would expect from Goatwhore, who have a likewise blackened, nasty but very rock ‘n’ roll approach to death metal. The songs don’t do a great deal to differentiate themselves from each other, but it’s also easy to get the sense that the group isn’t particularly concerned with that; the album is devoid of epic statements or grandiloquent overarching concepts, driving home the idea that what matters to Wormwitch is crooked and driving heavy metal. On that mark, gothic melodic/harmonic flourishes included calling to mind the more joyfully heavy moments of Cradle of Filth, Wormwitch deliver a solid and satisfying record. — Langdon Hickman",articles40,"['Manowar', 'Helloween', 'Disparager’s', 'Existential Dread', 'Disparager', 'Disparager', 'Idle Hands', 'Gabriel Franco', 'Robert Smith', 'Bruce Dickinson', 'The Cure', 'Iron Maiden', 'Black Sabbath', 'James Dio', 'Smoulder', 'Sarah Ann’s', 'Black Earth', 'Lost Years', 'Lost Years', 'Wormwitch', 'Cradle of Filth', 'Wormwitch']"

While its Goths predecessor was inspired by The Cure and Joy Division, this new album sees The Mountain Goats exploring the worlds of fantasy and sci-fi to launch a genre they describe as “dragon noir.” According to frontman John Darnielle, the LP “began life as a rock opera about a besieged seaside community called Riversend ruled by a benevolent wizard.”(Read: The 50 Most Outrageous Album Covers)<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>The realms beyond reality are nothing new to Darnielle, a longtime fan of Dungeons & Dragons and author of Wolf in White Van, a 2014 National Book Award-nominated novel about the escapist power of fantastical role-playing games.Of the LP’s 12 songs, already we’ve previously heard lead single “Younger” and “Cadaver Sniffing Dog”; the latter track uses a bloody crime scene as “a metaphor for a relationship in which there is nothing whatsoever left to salvage.”To support the new record, The Mountain Goats will kick off an extensive North American tour later this week, tickets for which can be purchased here.In League with Dragons Artwork:In League with Dragons Tracklist:

"Japanese Breakfast became something of an indie darling by dropping two albums over the course of two years, 2016’s Psychopomp and 2017’s Soft Sounds from Another Planet. While she’s remained actively touring behind those efforts, we haven’t heard anything new from Michelle Zauner since her sophomore release. Today, she’s finally returned with a fresh track, “Essentially”.(Read: 20 Essential SXSW Acts to Catch on Tour This Spring)The song comes as part of the inaugural single series from W Records, the label of luxury hotel chain W Hotels Worldwide. Zauner was sent to W Bali to record at the W Sound Suite studio there, with the original intention to record a completely different track. As she explained in a press release, arriving in Bali inspired her to “write something on the fly:”“I like the challenge of writing and arranging quickly and intuitively sometimes, and I had just bought a native instruments machine and wanted to explore a lot of the sample libraries it came with and work on the synths that were at the studio. It was a very idyllic place to work. I usually record in cold studios, so Bali was a pretty glamorous change. I felt so lucky the day I arrived just walking around the hotel.”“Essentially” is the first completely original track released on W Records, and it will be followed by a second Japanese Breakfast song. Proceeds from both tracks will go to a charity of her choosing, and a video for “Essentially” filmed at the soon-to-open W Philadelphia.While we wait for that, take a listen to the song below.Japanese Breakfast has a number of tour dates planned for the spring and summer, including stops at Atlanta’s Shaky Knees, Chicago’s Lollapalooza, and FORM Arcosanti in Arizona.

"Rammstein have released the song “Radio” as the second full single from their upcoming self-titled seventh studio album, and the track is accompanied by an NSFW music video (watch below).“Radio” is a melodic industrial ditty that is not nearly as heavy as the first single, “Deutschland”. The video, directed by Jörn Heitmann and set in the early 20th century, features nudity throughout, as the band’s performance is transmitted over the airwaves.Among the scenes in the video are a woman suckling a radio to her breast and a topless protester with the words “My radio is mine” written in German across her body. Meanwhile, an army of soldiers tries to break up Rammstein’s performance, only to end up dancing themselves.The video comes after Rammstein teased snippets of all 11 songs from the album, which is due May 17th.

"Track by Track is a recurring new music feature in which we give an artist the chance to dig deep into their latest full-length record, one song at a time.Silver Lake indie rockers Local Natives are back today with their new album, Violet Street. Available now from Loma Vista, you can stream the record in full below via Apple Music or Spotify.Serving as the follow-up to 2016’s Sunlit Youth, the new LP was produced by Shawn Everett, known for his work with the likes of Alabama Shakes and Kacey Musgraves. The writing process saw the band return to the close quarters conditions of their Gorilla Manor debut, only this time they were in a massive warehouse instead of a rented home. As vocalist/guitarist Taylor Rice explained,“It was fun, but also pushed us to outdo each other. We got back to our strengths. We’ve always been super collaborative and democratic, as we have three songwriters and singers, and all five of us have a lot of creative input. This was the most collaborative and open we’ve been though. We were raw and vulnerable. It’s the first time we didn’t do any pre-production, we went in and built the record out of nothing.”Listen to Violet Street below.

“Vogue”’s journey was definitely one of the more unexpected and experimental ones on the album. It started out as a minimal, delicate song on a nylon string guitar. Our friend Sara Nuefield, who plays in Arcade Fire, had shared one of her solo violin pieces with us a few months before at a festival. When we decided we wanted strings, we remembered her piece and Shawn (our wildly genius producer) slowed it down and pitched it to the song — it completely transformed the track. Then Shawn had us run around this binaural microphone shaped like a human head screaming at the top of our lungs and banging on trash can lids. Pure cacophony. He took that chaos and digitally tuned it until sounded like an angelic choir. Lyrically, we pulled strange phrases from the comment sections of various YouTube videos and collaged them together. Even before the violins, we knew we wanted the song to be about the human desire to feel a connection to god or a spiritual world. Unexpectedly the random phrases began to paint that picture and with some minor tweaks we felt like it achieved that ascendant, heavenly quality. Trying to turn something chaotic into something beautiful ended up being a theme of the whole recording process, so “Vogue” felt like the perfect introduction for Violet Street.“When Am I Gonna Lose You”:
Although the title sounds like a relationship near its end, that’s not really the case. The song is about the feeling of being in an amazing relationship but feeling the fear and anxiety that it can’t possibly last, whether just by twist of fate or because of your own self sabotage. It was inspired by a trip Taylor took to Big Sur with his, at the time, new girlfriend. He kept telling us how even when you’re at your happiest it can be difficult not to put up those self-protective barriers. Full disclosure, the story has a happy ending; they got married right after we finished recording the record, in Big Sur. Musically the song initially came together in our rehearsal space as the 5 of us jammed together. We wanted it to have a dark Fleetwood Mac vibe, something that could soundtrack driving up PCH. Also, I feel like I owe it to our engineer Ivan to mention the freak out during the last seven seconds of the song. I know it sound like it could’ve been a quick ProTools edit, but it was actually Ivan (and Matt) splicing up the instrumental on tape and scotch taping the tracks back together in random order on the wall of the studio. It took four days to do! Haha.“Café Amarillo”:
The seed for this song first came together on a writing trip we took to Mexico where we were able to write and rehearse as a full band basically outdoors. Unfortunately once we brought it into Shawn’s studio, we weren’t really feeling it. So a few of us switched instruments — Nik on keys and myself on bass, and the resulting live jam felt like a wholly new song. That jam turned into the final instrumental track. It’s our first song that’s featured backup singers – the incredible Olivia Walker and Anjolee Williams — and their performance really elevated the song to a new place. The song is about finding a kind of shelter from the storm when life or the world around you seems to be spiraling out. It’s not about sticking your head in the sand or anything like that, it’s about what keeps you grounded and strengthens you to keep pushing ahead. For us it meant our relationships with our wives and girlfriends and our relationships as bandmates. Kelcey said with all the tragedies and madness in the world while we were making the record, it was easy to feel powerless, but writing this song was a reminder of what gets you through all the things that you can’t make sense of.“Munich II”:
This interlude is a small section of a longer track we recorded with the working title “Munich”. We wanted “Munich II” to have a Beatles “Sun King” vibe. The longer track is an eight-minute instrumental jam based off a riff I came up with in Mexico. While we were jamming in the live room Shawn pulled up this app called Radioooo. It has this map of the world and when you click on a country you also select a decade and it will play some amazing song from that era. He randomly selected five countries and decades and had us jam on the riff in those five different musical styles. After that, he edited the results together as a score to the opening scene to the movie Drive. Meaning, if you started listening to “Munich” right as the movie begins, it’ll sync up with what’s on screen. I’m stoked that we’re releasing the full eight-minute instrumental as a 10-inch single with the deluxe edition of the album.“Megaton Mile”:
I’ve started summarizing “Megaton Mile” as “a fun song about the end of the world.” It started as a demo I made, inspired by some of my favorite songs with extra percussion, “Sympathy for the Devil”, “Rock the Casbah”, and “Since I Left You” by the Avalanches. The drum beat is definitely simpler than a lot of our songs but I wanted the bass to really shine as the lead instrument like you’d hear it in a Motown song. I assumed we’d set up in the room and maybe hire some extra percussionists and record a live take, but Shawn threw one of his many curveballs at us and suggested we take a page from the Brian Eno playbook and play the song “live” in a different way. We recorded every instrument and every chord of the song onto its own track on the tape machine as a four-bar loop. Then using the faders on the mixing desk we “performed” the song by sliding the appropriate faders up and down. It ended up looking like a game of Twister because all five of us had to be sliding various faders to get through a full take of the song. So even though it’s constructed from loops of tape, the song ended up still feeling really human with all the characteristics of that imperfect process. Lyrically the song is about living through a kind of Armageddon in Los Angeles. The title is a play on a stretch of Wilshire Blvd that’s called the Miracle Mile. I’ve always liked when artists pair dancey music with darker lyrics like “Nothing but Flowers” or “Everybody Knows”.“Someday Now”:
This song is about a couple, in which one person has been consumed by chasing their dream and has told their partner if they can just hold on till things settle down it will all work out great. The problem is sometimes dreams take longer to achieve and sometimes they aren’t achieved at all. Their partner is tired of waiting for Someday. They want that someday to be now.We ended up using the rhythm track from “Megaton Mile” to create “Someday Now”. Ivan and Shawn physically slowed the tape machine down until it was the right tempo and we built the song from there. Musically, we tried to use Marvin Gaye What’s Goin On album as a guide. It informed a lot of the strange chord changes on the chorus. I think Nik really killed it on bass on this song. I had recently bought a cheap lap steel guitar. Even though I’m a complete amateur at it but Shawn was able to throw enough reverb and effects on it to make it work. Between the lap steel and Shawn slowing the tape machine down even further for the outro, I can understand why Taylor thinks this song sounds like Spongebob.“Shy”:
Taylor explains the lyrics to “Shy” as: “Examining my own sense of masculinity, how I’ve never felt comfortable with many of the expectations put on boys at a young age. Those expectations are starting to change as culture more broadly starts to push back against a patriarchal establishment, and pushing for women to a claim a share of assertiveness and power.” This is another song that Shawn really took in unexpected directions. We recorded the basic track with two drum sets in the room playing against a distorted drum machine loop. It’s got this surfy, swamp rumble to it that almost felt like something from our first record. Then, in the spirit of Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk, Shawn masterminded a huge horn section freak out halfway through the song. It’s also got one of the most bizarre guitar solos. We actually covered “Tusk” for a Spotify session a little while back and I can’t remember whose idea it was but we sampled ourselves and put in the noisy moment from that cover to glue “Shy” together.“Garden of Elysian”:
This song has some of my favorite lyrics on the album. It’s about a nostalgic look at what your life could have been if you had taken a different path with an old lover. It’s set at the top of one the hills in Elysian Park looking out towards downtown LA and hearing the crowd from Dodger Stadium down the road. We recorded this one live in the room without a metronome so it could drag and push where it needed to. One of my favorite songs, David Ruffin’s “Let Somebody Love Me”, was a big influence on this one. It definitely doesn’t feel retro though with all of Shawn’s production, the experimental string arrangements and the vocal modulation.“Gulf Shores”:
I’m pretty sure the synth that Nik used to play the bass line in the verse is the same one used to make the goofy bass sounds from Seinfeld. The lyrics are about realizing how much you need somebody and how closely linked you are with them, so much so that if they walked away, your world could come crashing down. This is yet another song that got flipped on its head in the studio. It started out as more of a Beach Boys vibe with a nylon string guitar and Kelcey, Taylor and I singing three-part harmony. The drum machine originally was just a placeholder for Matt to play drums against but we grew to love it. It was one of those sessions that went really late into the night and at some point Shawn started slamming the chorus really hard. Not sure if we were just delirious but once the outro section came together I remember me, Taylor and Shawn dancing in the control room. What sounds like a synth is actually Taylor’s guitar through some great vintage fuzz pedals.“Tap Dancer”:
I’ll let Kelcey explain this one: “At the beginning of 2017, Taylor and I were on a houseboat in Labyrinth Canyon filming an episode of Viceland’s environmental series Earthworks, and we wanted to play something around a campfire later that night. It’s the reason we sing together on the whole song, because we liked how it felt by the fire that night. Ryan helped me craft the lyrics, which are about longing for a simpler time when you didn’t realize what you wanted, you were just grateful for what you had. I had been reading Joan Didion’s The Year of Magical Thinking, and she had a line that read, “I would always be armed against artificial roses,” and it just stuck with me. The idea of artificial roses as a negative thing, but not because of what they are. Just that before, I’d be able to enjoy them, but now I have experienced so much, I know that they’re not real, and can’t derive as much joy from them.”Shawn took all the vocals we recorded and smashed them together for the post-chorus vocal part. We loved that it sounded like a beautiful, alien language. It felt like another example of trying to turn chaos into something beautiful and a great bookend to close the album.",articles40,"['Track', 'Spotify', 'Shawn Everett', 'Alabama Shakes', 'Kacey Musgraves', '”Listen', 'hidden;line', 'Track', 'Arcade Fire', 'Big Sur', 'Fleetwood Mac', '!

Stream the whole thing below via Apple Music or Spotify.Featuring co-production from Dave Harrington, the record follows 2014’s Built on Glass and 2017’s Missing Link EP. It took four years for the effort to come together, with vocals being recorded all over the world in “spaces and environments that most inspired” Murphy. The instrumentation was later recorded at Brooklyn’s Figure 8 studio, where Murphy was joined by over 15 musicians and a full orchestra. The LP was previewed with singles “Sanity” and “Dangerous”As Murphy explained in an interview with Billboard, working with Harrington and engineer Phil Weinrobe had a major impact on him in addition to Run Fast Sleep Naked. “Words can’t even express what it’s like with these two human beings,” he said. “Half the time we wouldn’t even finish our sentences because we knew exactly what was going on. I could not have made this record without them.” It sounds like he’ll be making more music with the pair in the future as their collaboration has “branched off into its own project” tentatively called Nick Murphy and the Program.Teasing more new music before the year’s out, Murphy said of the new project, “It’s been more fruitful than working on my own stuff, and so far I definitely have more music from that project than I do my own stuff.”But until then, you can stream Run Fast Sleep Naked Below.

"On Thursday morning, Bruce Springsteen rode on up on his horse with confirmation of his first new album in five years, Western Stars, due out June 14th via Columbia. As promised, he’s let loose his first new single off the record, “Hello Sunshine”.Seeing how the album draws inspiration from the SoCal pop records of the late ‘60s and early ‘70s, it’s not surprising to hear echoes of Glenn Campbell’s somber vocals or the arrangements of Burt Bacharach. Springsteen’s wearing his influences aboard a train from Middle America to the West Coast.“You know I always liked that empty road/ No place to be and miles to go,” he croons deep into the ballad, which soon connects with a mild warning, of “You can get a little too fond of the blues/ you walk too far, you walk away.” At 69 years old, he’s still imparting words of wisdom. Probably always will.Hitch a ride with Bruce and hit the open roads by watching the song’s accompanying video, which you can see below.Western Stars Tracklist:

"The countdown is over: Taylor Swift has returned.After teasing the world with cryptic Insta posts, tweets, and one outrageously gorgeous butterfly mural, the blockbuster pop star finally unleashed her new single, “ME!”Featuring an assist by Panic! At the Disco’s Brendon Urie, who’s no stranger to Swift’s catalogue, the new track finds the Nashville star with considerably more color than her previous black-and-white aesthetic for 2017’s Reputation.It helps, of course, that she’s paired the summery soon-to-be-smash with another jaw-dropping music video, one that’ll undoubtedly break another YouTube record in, oh, five, four, three, two…“ME!” is the first track off Swift’s forthcoming seventh album and first release with Republic Records, which inked Swift to a multi-year contract late last year.",articles40,"['Taylor Swift', 'Brendon Urie', 'Swift’s']"
"Prolific Australian psych rockers King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard are back today with their new full-length, Fishing for Fishies. Subscribers of Apple Music and Spotify can listen below.The new LP comes two years after their five-album sprint in 2017 (Flying Microtonal Bananan, Murder of the Universe, Sketches of Brunswick East, Polygondwanaland, and Gumboot Soup). It marks the band’s 14th full-length overall and is described in a press release as “perhaps their most perfectly-realized album to date.” Ahead of the effort, The Gizz released a trio of singles — its title track, “Cyboogie”, and “Boogieman Sam” — as well as the non-album track, “Planet B”.Explaining how recording Fishing for Fishies was an entirely different — and certainly longer — process than their 2017 output, frontman Stu Mackenzie recently told Dork,“We’ve never made a record like this before. We thought we knew what we were trying to make. We really thought we knew what we were doing, and then… It’s funny after making five records with conviction. For me, I think about making albums a lot more than I think about making songs. An individual song, for me, has to make sense on an album. It has to work in sequence with the record. It has to fit.”For more of your King Gizzard fix while also supporting your favorite independent music and entertainment publication Consequence of Sound, pick up the band’s catalog on vinyl here and grab tickets to their upcoming tour over here.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Fishing for Fishies Artwork:Fishing for Fishies Tracklist:

"Origins is a recurring feature that asks musicians if they can explain the different inspirations behind their new music.After years making a name for himself in the band Blue Blazer, Los Angeles indie songwriter Jonny Shane launched a solo project in the hopes of creating “more direct, autobiographical” material on his own terms. Modern Love Child is his new musical medium, and one that he’s been molding with the Ben Kweller, whom he considers a friend and role model.The two first met by chance in the LA neighborhood of Venice, then again all the way across the country at a coffee shop in Connecticut. “I kept running into Jonny in the most random places,” Kweller said in a press statement. “It was like the universe was speaking to us.”Shane and Kweller heeded the universe’s message, and soon, the pair was diligently working on Shane’s debut album, MLC. Due out later this year, the record is being previewed today with a song called “Just For Kids”, co-written by Kweller.As Shane tells Consequence of Sound, the track was inspired by a memorable trip he took with a girlfriend:“The song was inspired from when I drove along the coast from San Francisco to Los Angeles, at the time I was just starting to fall in love with a girl who I started seeing romantically. The feeling I had in my stomach of nerves and excitement was the same feeling I had when I had a crushes on girls when I was a little kid. Hence the line ‘falling in love ain’t just for kids.'”The steady, consuming feeling of love is captured neatly on the driving “Just for Kids”, which can be streamed below via its official music video.Shane has offered more details on what sparked the creativity that led to “Just for Kids”.Pacific Coast Highway:Driving along the coast of California in all its beauty. There is a line, “I think I’ve been here before in one of my dreams” – On certain stretches of the PCH (Pacific Coast Highway), it literally looks like its something from a dream. The farmland that turns into the rugged coastline that melts into the big Pacific blue ocean. Hard not to feel something when you see that, especially if your falling in love at the same time.In-N-Out fries: On this drive along the coast, me and my girl talked about everything and anything. We totally opened up. We left no stone unturned. For a long period of time argued which fast food restaurant has the best fries. We obviously concluded that McDonald’s has the best fries and In and Out fries kinda suck.The moon:Late at night, in the middle of nowhere, the man in the moon starts to feel like company. Towards the end of this drive, which inspired this song, the moon seemed brighter and bigger than normal. Or maybe it just seemed that way because I was with a beautiful girl. I’m pretty certain there is a word in French for the moon reflecting off the ocean, not sure what it is in English, but when I was writing this song, that image was stuck in my head.The radio:There’s something special about being on a long drive with a friend or lover and listening to the same songs on the radio over and over and over. Often on a long drive, there are times where things are just silent and there’s nothing to talk about, the radio helps for those times in-between. It fills the void and connects the dots. Finally, there’s nothing like driving in a car and singing your heart out to your favorite song with friends or lovers.Clouds:I wrote, “You see what I see in the clouds,” which to me means, you have the same dreams as me, you see the world how I see it and you want the same things. When I was a little kid, I used to look up at the clouds and describe them as different objects, like, “Oh that cloud looks like an ice-cream cone,” and so on. I think the idea of two people seeing the same thing in the clouds is kinda beautiful. It’s connecting over something that won’t be there forever. But maybe that connection will. It kinda brings it back to the whole kid thing where, whether your talking about clouds as a kid or french fries as an adult, the feeling you have in your stomach when you’re falling for someone is the same feeling no matter what age you are.Modern Love Child 2019 Tour Dates:

"Norwegian black metal legends Darkthrone will return with a new studio album, Old Star, on May 31st via Peaceville Records. The band has shared the first single from the record, “Hardship of the Scots”, an exercise in riffage that spans the many eras of heavy metal (stream below).Fenriz, one half of the duo that also includes Ted “Nocturno Culto” Skjellum, hails the new album as a return to the style of Darkthrone’s 2016 album Arctic Thunder, except “more solid and with even better riffs,” he stated in a press release.“Again we are here with the riffs,” Fenriz continued. “A while after our previous Arctic Thunder album, it became apparent that we would continue in that same style, ‘black old heavy metal’ with slow thrash, classic doom and slow death metal.”A known connoisseur of metal history and lore, Fenriz proudly wears his influences on his sleeve — quite literally, in the form of many band patches — and in his songwriting, as well. This is illustrated in “Hardship of the Scots”, which was written by Fenriz while he was playing guitar and sitting on the porch. The song has a noticeably vintage, analog tone, opening with an ’80s glam metal riff before delving into more cavernous Celtic Frost-inspired vocal passages.“My song here seems to start with an Invasion of Your Privacy Ratt-era riff or perhaps one from The Ultimate Sin by Ozzy Osbourne,” Fenriz explained, “but when I had bicycled my guitar from the Bombshelter and sat down on the porch to strum it, the fact is that (as far as I remember) this entire track was done in an hour and I remember texting Ted (Skjellum) about it.”Of the album, he adds : “All in all it is our most ’80s album so far and our most metal one to date with drum sound typical for the ’80s USA/German market and damned lyrics, which are all written by me. We feel that Old Star is the big brother of Arctic Thunder.”Darkthrone recorded Old Star at the band’s Necrohell 2 Studios, with engineering and production duties carried out by Skjellum. The band made sure its vision was carried through to the end, enlisting Sanford Parker (Voivod) at Hypercube Studios for additional mixing before sending the album to Jack Control at Enormous Door for mastering.The album will be released on CD, cassette, digital, and a variety of vinyl LP packages. Pre-orders are available from Peaceville here.",articles40,"['Darkthrone', 'Old Star', 'Darkthrone’s', 'Fenriz', 'Fenriz', 'Fenriz', 'Celtic Frost', 'Fenriz', 'Old Star', 'Old Star', 'Sanford Parker', 'Voivod']"
"The Black Keys have announced a new album, “Let’s Rock”, their first full-length in five years. The duo’s ninth LP overall, the 12-track effort is due June 28th via Easy Eye Sound/Nonesuch Records.While serving as the follow-up to 2014’s Turn Blue, a press release notes the new record harkens back to “the straightforward rock” of the band’s earlier days. “When we’re together we are The Black Keys,” singer/guitarist Dan Auerbach said in a statement. “That’s where that real magic is, and always has been since we were sixteen.”(Read: Ranking: Every Alternative Rock No. 1 Hit from Worst to Best)Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney tracked the music live at the former’s Nashville-based Easy Eye Sound studio. They were joined only by backing vocalists Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson, which emphasized what Carney called their “simple approach.” “The record is like a homage to electric guitar,” he explained, adding they “trimmed all the fat like we used to do.”Having previously shared the comeback single “Lo/Hi”, the Keys are previewing “Let’s Rock” today with “Eagle Birds”. It’s a muddy stomper that slaps like a ’70s highway tune, and you can listen below.Auerbach and Carney, who recently married Michelle Branch, had to pull out of their scheduled Woodstock 50 appearance. (Which may have been fortuitous, since the festival apparently doesn’t have its permits yet.)

"Rapper Open Mike Eagle and comedian Baron Vaughn have combined their talents for a new Comedy Central series called The New Negroes. The weekly variety show is packed with multiple stand-up sets, and each episode boasts a new original song and music video by OME in collaboration with different music guests.Earlier this month we heard the first of those collaborations, “Unfiltered”, featuring Danny Brown. A second joint track has been revealed in “Police Myself” which sees OME sharing the mic with elusive rap legend MF DOOM.“Police Myself” is taken from the upcoming second episode of The New Negroes, which focuses on crime and justice. As such, the track’s accompanying video follows OME and the police alter-ego voice in his head, which often tries to steer him out of trouble.OME elaborated further in a press statement:“The theme of the episode is criminality and we made a song and video outlining the idea of ‘double consciousness’ where one has to be aware of their own internal experience but also aware of how others perceive them. For black Americans and other marginalized people around the world that perception can be the difference between life and death.”(Read: The Top TV Shows of 2018)Watch the clip for “Police Myself” below.The second New Negroes episode airs this Friday, April 26th.OME dropped his What Happens When I Try to Relax EP in 2018, while his last proper full-length, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream, came the year before that.

"While it doesn’t look like System of a Down are ready to record new music anytime soon, singer Serj Tankian has lent his instantly recognizable vocals to a cover of the Blue Öyster Cult classic “Godzilla” for the upcoming movie Godzilla: King of the Monsters.The track — a collaboration between Tankian and the film’s soundtrack composer Bear McCreary (The Walking Dead) — offers a dramatic take on the Blue Öyster Cult song, utilizing an orchestra, Japanese taiko drumming, and a chanting chorus. The song also features contributions from members of Dethklok, including Brendon Small and Gene Hoglan (also of Testament).McCreary told Rolling Stone that the track is “perhaps the most audacious piece of music I have ever produced, jammed to the breaking point with orchestra, choir, taiko chanting, taiko drumming, heavy metal rhythm section, Gene Hoglan’s blistering double-kick drums, and Serj’s distinct vocals. It is complete musical madness.”The Godzilla: King of the Monsters movie soundtrack arrives on May 24th, while the film hits theaters on May 31st. The action flick stars Vera Farmiga, Millie Bobby Brown, Bradley Whitford and Sally Hawkins, and will feature the monsters Mothra, Rodan and Ghidora alongside the titular Godzilla.System of a Down, meanwhile, will headline the Sonic Temple festival in Columbus, Ohio, on May 17th, and Chicago Open Air in Bridgeview, Illinois, on May 18th. Last year, Tankian and guitarist-singer Daron Malakian both opened up on why the band hasn’t recorded new music since 2005, explaining that there were creative differences between them, among other obstacles.",articles40,"['System', 'Serj Tankian', 'Blue Öyster Cult', 'The Walking Dead', 'Blue Öyster Cult', 'Dethklok', 'Brendon Small', 'Rolling Stone', 'Serj’s', 'Bradley Whitford', 'Sally Hawkins', 'Daron Malakian']"

"Tekashi 6ix9ine, along with four associates, was arrested last year following a five-year federal investigation into the criminal activities of the Bloods street gang known as Nine Trey Bloods, of which 6ix9ine is said to be a member. 6ix9ine has since pleaded guilty to nine federal counts and offered to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced sentence.In his guilty plea, 6ix9ine acknowledged that he joined Nine Trey Bloods in 2017 and admitted to assisting the gang in its attempt to kill a rival gang member. 6ix9ine also said he himself paid an associate to shoot Chief Keef.While 6ix9ine may have saved himself by working with prosecutors, some have called him out for snitching. One of those is Compton’s YG, with whom 6ix9ine already has major rap beef.During his Coachella set last weekend, YG debuted a new single called “Stop Snitchin”. For his performance, YG had 6ix9ine’s mugshot boldly projected behind him while he rapped, “You got fear in your heart so you cooperate/ I guess that’s how b*tch ni**as operate.”A new music video for “Stop Snitchin” has been released today, and although it contains no explicit references to 6ix9ine, it seems YG’s message has already been made clear.Check it out below, followed by footage from his Coachella performance of “Stop Snitchin”.The two rappers have been tangled up in drama ever since 6ix9ine called YG out during an interview on The Breakfast Club.

"Mannequin Pussy have announced a new studio album, Patience, which is due out on June 21st via Epitaph. To preview the LP, the indie punk band has also shared lead single, “Drunk II”, along with its theatric, retro music video.Marking their third studio effort to date, Patience follows up 2016’s Romantic and their 2014 debut Gypsy Pervert. The collection was captured at Conshohocken, Pennsylvania’s Studio 4, with help from producer and engineer Will Yip (Quicksand, The Menzingers). As lead singer Marisa Dabice explained, “In the past there’s been a chaotic feeling to the recording process, but working with Will put us in a different headspace… It helped us show our progression over the past few years and make a very crisp-sounding record, without losing the dirtiness of what Mannequin Pussy really is.”The album focuses on vulnerability and the experience of being within the body, frequently offering a stark contrast to the group’s wild, in-your-face demeanor. These tensions continue throughout the LP, with explosive riffs juxtaposed with subtle yet honest lyrics and intricate arrangements. With the newly released “Drunk II”, such opposites are at the forefront, with Dabice offering a performance that is alternatingly tender and abrasive. She explained in a statement,“It’s too easy now to look back on that song and feel a mixture of pity and disgust for myself and the emotions I poured into it. I never saw a breakup as anything other than emotional torture. But now, I understand that a breakup is a gift. Heartbreak is a gift. Someone leaving your life when you don’t expect them to is one of the most honest things we can experience. By electing to leave your life someone is telling you their truth: that they can’t be there for you the way you wish they could. That they can’t love you the way that you loved them. It took me a long time to realize that it is better to be alone than to be with someone who doesn’t really want to be there. You should never have to convince someone to love you. At the end of the song when I sing ‘Everyone gather round, I have the answer now’ – that is fswhat I’m saying.”The singer also directed the song’s captivating music video, that follows her on a night out at a dive bar. Again, there is a layer of ambivalence over the visual, matching the multiple directions of the music against the lyrics. She elaborated,“I wanted to capture the feeling that so many of us experience when we are heartbroken and trying to move on. We pretend we have fun so that we are socially acceptable to those around us. We hope that drinking will make us happy and we wish that our nights will lead us into the arms of a beautiful stranger who will momentarily distract us from the pain we feel. I wanted to blend reality and fantasy in the music video for ‘Drunk II’ – where you aren’t quite sure if my character is just out with her bandmates and friends, pitifully crying to them about their lost love or if they are actually meeting those beautiful strangers every night. I wanted to show what it feels like to be out and heartbroken — that no matter where you are it feels like you are the only one with a broken heart. That everyone around you is deeply in love and you are completely alone. That no matter who you meet, you can’t stop thinking about that person who you lost.”Watch “Drunk II” below, and pre-order Patience here.Patience Artwork:Patience Tracklist:

"Sum 41 have announced that they will release a new album, Order in Decline, on July 19th via Hopeless Records. They’ve also unleashed the first single, “Out for Blood” (watch the video below).Order in Decline is the follow-up to 2016’s 13 Voices, which marked a comeback of sorts for the Canadian punk-rock band after frontman Deryck Whibley was hospitalized for severe alcoholism in 2014. That album also marked the return of guitarist Dave Baksh, after he had left the band in 2006.The new album features lyrics that reflect the social and political turmoil in the United States and Canada over the past few years, with Whibley explaining in a press release, “The last thing I wanted to do was write a social or political protest record, and Order In Decline is not that. It’s also very hard not to have feelings about everything that’s going on in the world.”Sum 41 will embark on a US tour that includes headlining shows and a run of dates on the inaugural Rockstar Energy Drink Disrupt touring festival.

"The collaboration between Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers as Better Oblivion Community Center has been nothing but a smashing success. Their self-titled debut is incredibly solid, and their first tour was loaded with fun covers. Before bringing their show over to Europe, the duo are celebrating the end of their North American run with even more greatness in the form of a Tiny Desk Concert and two new tracks.Over at NPR, the duo performed a trio of Better Oblivion Community Center tracks: “Dylan Thomas”, “Exception to the Rule”, and “My City”. Tour mates Christian Lee Hutson and Emily Retsas backed them up, but it was another guest that stole the show: Longtime host Bob Boilen stepped behind the desk for the first time to swing a whirly tube during the closing song.Check out the video below.As a second treat for fans who may have missed them live, BOCC have also shared two tracks previously only available on a tour-exclusive 7-inch. The A-side is non-album track “Little Trouble”, a punchy, three-minute jaunt they frequently performed live, while the reverse is a “daydreamin’ version” of the single “Sleepwalkin'” that gives it an electrodance vibe.Listen to both below.",articles40,"['Conor Oberst', 'Emily Retsas']"

"Beak>, the electronic music project featuring Portishead’s Geoff Barrow, are gearing up to release a new EP. The as-yet-untitled collection is due out June 21st through INVADA Records and follows the group’s >>> full-length from 2018.As a taste of this forthcoming effort, the Barrow & co. have broken off the first single, “Life Goes On”. According to a statement, it was inspired by a recent trip to Mexico City.(Read: The 100 Greatest Movie Soundtracks of All Time)As the story goes, Beak> were drawn to sounds of what appeared to be a distorted young girl’s voice. “Further investigation revealed the source as a recording used by scrap-collecting carts urging people to bring out old beds and washing machines.”That same girl’s voice is featured in the intro of “Life Goes On”, which is described as “lovechild of Santana and Sonic Youth”. Hear it for yourself below.“Life Goes On” Artwork:Beak> have a handful of upcoming European tour dates lined up, including appearances at Primavera Sound in Spain and England’s End of the Road Festival. While you wait for the new EP, stock up on the band’s past vinyl releases by heading here.Previously, Barrow accused rapper Lil Pump of sampling his Annihilation score composition “The Alien” for the “deeply fucking sexist song “Racks on Racks”.In related news, Portishead’s Beth Gibbons just released a new album in collaboration with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra.",articles40,"['Barrow & co.', 'Lil Pump']"
"Origins is a recurring feature that asks musicians to reveal the inspirations behind their new music.Next month, Greys will release their new album, Age Hasn’t Spoiled You, via Carpark Records. Due out on May 10th, the collection will mark the experimental quartet’s third LP to date, following up 2016’s Outer Heaven and Warm Shadow. Currently, the CoSigned Toronto-based ensemble is in a period of immense growth — or rather, refinement, as evidenced with Age Hasn’t Spoiled You’s previously released lead single “These Things Happen”. This development is similarly highlighted with new track “Kill Appeal”, which the band has released today along with a hauntingly surrealist music video.Though the four-piece has formerly been pushed into the boxes of “noise rock” or “punk,” Greys has been slowly shedding such classifications. With inspirations as disparate as Madonna; Chemical Brothers; and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young on this latest LP, the band has deftly synthesized these new influences with their core sound. One might expect uncharacteristic or cheesy compositions with such a list of references, but instead, Greys use those benchmarks — in partnership with a flurry of inventive studio techniques — to facilitate further maturation of the project’s sound. On songs like “Kill Appeal”, the product is a captivating showcase of a band in their prime, solid in their identity.(Read: Artists Reflect on 25 Years of Green Day’s Dookie)Like “These Things Happen”, the latest from Greys has political underpinnings. Frontman Shehzaad Jiwani explained,“The lyrics of ‘Kill Appeal’ deal with various aspects of living in a major metropolitan city, from old neighborhoods being rapidly mutilated to suit the needs of wealthy newcomers to the increasingly imposing police presence. The video seeks to convey still more elements of city living in this era of content rot, constant surveillance, and civil unrest by creating snapshots of several different facets of life through the lens of a half-baked millennial flipping channels or scrolling through his Instagram feed. Spoiled for choice, and none of the options are the right one.”Check out “Kill Appeal” via its accompanying music video below.Jiwani also took the time to dive deeper into the Origins of “Kill Appeal”, detailing the wide-ranging inspirations of the track. He offers both the mundane (wanting to skateboard but sucking, cartoons muted and left on in the background, etc.) and the thought-provoking (James Baldwin, mass shootings in Toronto). Read on below.Skate Videos:More than anything, I have always wanted to be able to skate, but since I am athletically inept and terrified of breaking my tender bones, I settle on watching skate videos. I got really into a few by Polar, Palace, Krooked, We Fried, and the Glass series by a dude from Toronto named Erick Valentin. The song was originally called “Urethane”, which is what the wheels on skateboards are made of. I envisioned a song flowing like you are skating through the city at night, seeing different aspects of it present themselves to you during a nocturnal cruise through a dystopian environment, which is why we chose that opening shot for the video.Roland SH-101:I was on the hunt for a synth that could do some really grimy bass, similar to the kind you hear at the end of the movie Annihilation. I rented the SH-101 reissue because I read that the Chemical Brothers used the original a lot, and made some really noisy patches that I’d looped to make the mechanical noises you hear throughout the tune. The main bass bits were layered with this and a Minimoog to be as disorienting as possible while still lulling you into some false sense of comfort the way it falls in and out of tune with itself. That sound is, to me, an accurate sonic representation of what it is like inside my head when I feel especially anxious or, worse, dissociative. Chris Sandes, our fearless engineer, kept having to leave the room because the bass frequencies made him sick. Mission accomplished.James Baldwin:I watched I Am Not Your Negro when it came out and a quote that stuck with me was, “All your buried corpses now begin to speak,” which is paraphrased at the end of the song. Some of the lyrics touch on police brutality and the systematic displacement of marginalized people, both of which are subjects Baldwin had addressed so eloquently. What struck me about him was how he was able to effectively change people’s minds about such complex issues at such a politically charged moment in history. He seemed like such a gentle person, and his measured, compassionate way of debating made me long for a time where people were able to discuss such heavy topics in public forums and actually hear each other, as evidenced by many of his talk show or roundtable appearances. My vocal delivery was partly inspired by this approach in that I tried to sing more softly about the issues than yell them over the noise.Liquid Television:When I am writing, I usually watch something on mute that informs some aspect of the song in a roundabout way. There is a sort of nihilistic quality to the animation from the original MTV Liquid Television lineup — Aeon Flux, The Maxx, Beavis & Butthead — that I really wanted to capture in the music in some capacity. The alien bits in the video are sort of a reference to that. I wanted the video to have a similarly deranged vibe. The disparate images and sounds are meant to recall the weird shit you’d find flipping channels when you were old enough to stay up late but not allowed to be out past midnight. (See also: Liquid Sky)Toronto, Ontario, 2018:Lots of senseless things happened in Toronto last year while we were making this record. There was a mass shooting, which is one of the first I’ve heard of happening here and I have lived in Toronto my entire life. There was the incident involving the man who ran over dozens of people on a crowded street with a van. On top of that, conservative charlatan Doug Ford (brother of the deceased crack-smoking mayor and hapless idiot Rob Ford) was elected premiere of Ontario, almost immediately cutting funds to things like green energy and overdose-prevention centers. So much of what I love about my city is being eradicated, and I wanted to address that in a way that was both impressionistic and abstract, which we attempted to convey with the video as well.",articles40,"['Crosby', 'Stills', 'Nash & Young', 'These Things Happen', 'Jiwani', 'Palace', 'Krooked', 'Baldwin', 'The Maxx', 'Liquid Sky)Toronto', 'Lots', 'Doug Ford']"
"Right before Valentine’s Day, Lucy Dacus released her cover of Édith Piaf’s  “La Vie en Rose”, which marked the first installment in her new holiday song series. Now, the folk singer-songwriter has returned with a new track titled “My Mother & I”, which celebrates both Mother’s Day and the start of Taurus season.On its surface, the new single is a soft and gentle ode to “babies born in the month of May.” However, Dacus uses the framework to explore women’s body images and the generational passing down of weight-oriented neuroses. The track features an unflinchingly honest examination of the topic, with the poignant topic beautifully contrasted with the cascading, simplistic acoustic guitar that underlies the composition.As Dacus explained in a statement,“Being adopted has encouraged me to consider what mothers pass on through blood and body, and what they impart in the way of socialization and context. We — daughters, and all children — easily inherit the shame and fear of our mothers, but also the pride, self-assurance, and lessons of love. This song focuses on body image and the distinction between the body and the soul, which I can hardly claim to have clarity about to this day. I also reflect on traits my mother and I share as Taurean women- how we are steadfast but headstrong, empathetic but grounded, and dedicated to finding and giving reliable love and comfort.”Listen to “My Mother & I” below.In other news, Dacus has a busy tour schedule coming, with a handful of United States shows slated for the next few weeks before her summer European tour. The singer also has plans to release additional songs in the series for Independence Day, Bruce Springsteen’s birthday, Halloween, Christmas, and New Year’s.

"Like fellow shoegaze titans My Bloody Valentine and Slowdive, Ride is enjoying that post-reunion life so much that they decided to write more fresh music. The recently reunited UK outfit has today announced a new album, This Is Not a Safe Place.Produced by Erol Alkan and mixed by frequent collaborator Alan Moulder, the record is due out August 16th via Wichita Recordings. It follows 2017’s Weather Diaries, Ride’s first album in 21 years, and its companion EP, Tomorrow’s Shore.(Read: 10 Other Shoegaze Bands You Should Know)The news is accompanied by “Future Love”, the album’s lead single. It’s a chipper, harmony-driven song that lifts the corners of shoegaze’s traditionally dreary expression. It almost seems to tap into the secretly forlorn British pop of the ‘60s, like the bittersweet sighs of The Kinks or The Zombies. Maybe the single is a hint of what’s to come on the album: brighter vocals, quieter guitars, and an overarching optimism stemming from their steadfast post-reunion success.According to a press release, the album was created at the end of 2018 and start of 2019. It goes on to say that Ride “gathered influences from the Jean Michel Basquiat exhibition at London’s Barbican Centre and the post punk sound of The Fall and Sonic Youth.” The album is now available to pre-order.

"Flying Lotus is set to return on May 24th with his first album in nearly five years, Flamagra. After announcing the effort with the lead single “Fire Is Coming” featuring David Lynch, FlyLo is sharing another two-track taste of the LP in the form of “Spontaneous” and “Takashi”.Described as a mini-suite, the two songs flow right into one another. First comes “Spontaneous”, a funky seduction featuring Yukimi Nagano of Little Dragon asking, “Don’t you wanna test my love?” As the final notes twinkly off into space, the cosmic “Takashi” picks up with its soulful instrumental freakout.

"Tim Heidecker’s recent musical output has mostly presented a darkly comedic take on our current mess of a political climate. After pissing off the right with 2017’sToo Dumb For Suicide: Tim Heidecker’s Trump Songs and Another Year in Hell: Collected Songs from 2018 from earlier this year, the QAnon trolls were out to get the comedian-musician. Someone started a rumor that Heidecker’s wife had left him, which instead of annoying him, inspired him to turn away from politics and try his hand at a breakup album.The result, What the Brokenhearted Do…, is due out June 7th via Jagjaguwar. Like the Incels online had envisioned, Heidecker “imagined himself going through an awful divorce and let the hits flow.” Produced by Foxygen’s Jonathan Rado (Weyes Blood, Whitney), the 11-track effort is being previewed by the lead single “When I Get Up”.Don’t let the song’s jaunty, carousel rhythm fool you — “When I Get Up” is not about seizing the bright new day. “If I go back to my dreamland/ You might be waiting for me,” Heidecker sings. “That’s where I know I’m wanted/ That’s where I want to be.”Check out the track via its accompanying video, which sees Heidecker pitching his elaborate concept for the video itself.Pre-orders for What the Brokenhearted Do… are going on now, and you can get Heidecker’s past work on vinyl (while supporting Consequence of Sound) here.Heidecker and Gregg Turkington are currently on their “On Cinema at the Cinema Live” tour.

"Last year, Remo Drive reissued their debut 2017 record Greatest Hits and dropped an EP titled Pop Music. Now, the up-and-coming emo/pop-punk outfit have announced their sophomore album, Natural, Everyday Degradation, and released two new songs.Due out on May 31st via Epitaph, Natural, Everyday Degradation finds brothers Erik and Stephen Paulson refining Remo Drive’s sound. Where Greatest Hits amounted to an enthusiastic but, at points, naive collection, the new LP promises “a sturdier brand of indie-rock” produced by Joe Reinhart and mixed by Peter Katis. The group has also furthered their scope for their forthcoming release, evolving Greatest Hits’ suburban perspective into a more comprehensive point of view born from touring and time.(Read: The 100 Best Pop Punk Bands)To preview the album, Remo Drive have dropped a pair of sample tracks, “Two Bux” and “The Grind”. The former is more reflective, with the song frequently opening into melodic expanses juxtaposed with grumbling bass and heavier refrains. Explained Erik Paulson,“‘Two Bux’ is about coming of age, moral conflict, and guilt. At some point in most people’s lives, they decide they would like to try some of the things their childhood rulebook would not allow. These experiences have the power to be both pleasurable and confusing. More often than not, it is some combination of both.”On the other hand, “The Grind” is energetic, with prominent guitar riffs throughout. Added Paulson,“This song is about the tensions of being in a band written in the style of a love song. Creating music, traveling, and performing are, in their center, nearly identical to the things that make romantic, familial, and platonic relationships so impactful. The aforementioned experiences are also the same things that make these relationships so difficult. It felt natural and cathartic to tie these ideas together by way of a song.”Listen to both new tracks below.Remo Drive will support the new album with a North American summer tour.

"Nick Murphy (fka Chet Faker) is set to return with his sophomore album, Run Fast Sleep Naked, this Friday. Co-produced by Dave Harrington, the collection follows up his breakthrough 2014 debut, Built on Glass, and 2017’s Missing Link EP. The Australian producer and musician previously previewed the release with lead single, “Sanity”; now, he’s unveiled another track in “Dangerous”.Previously, Murphy noted that his new record was born from a period of intense self-reflection, including an examination of the role of an artist in modern society. Appropriately, “Dangerous” seems to stem from this contemplative work, with ambiguous lyrics that work both as a love song and an honest critique of his evolution as a musician. He croons, “I know I’m honest with myself/ but does my self know any lies?/ Now, what do I do?/ Maybe I’m dangerous.”Musically, the singer presents a characteristically soulful number, with initially minimal instrumentation. Midway through the song, a laidback bass kicks in, progressive layers of shimmering effects building on top as the song continues. Take a listen for yourself below.Murphy kicks off his spring tour in support of Run Fast Sleep Naked this Friday, April 26th.

In your face and unabashedly catchy, the song is highlighted by its delightful lyrical turns-of-phrase, rapid-fire riffs, and energetic backing howls and growls.(Read: The 50 Albums That Shaped Punk Rock)L7 has also released a new music video to complement “Stadium West”.

We’re still pleasantly shocked that she agreed to sing ‘Jenny of Oldstones,’ and we’re in love with the result.”“When I first heard the song it sounded like a Celtic lullaby to me,” Welch added. “Celtic music has always been in my blood, so I felt like I could do something with it.

13. “Moonage Daydream” (David Bowie)A limited-edition abridged version of this covers album was released by the band last year under the name The Eagles of Death Metal Presents Pigeons of Shit Metal. The humorous title dates back to a 2006 insult from Guns N’ Roses, who EODM were supporting on tour at the time:The infamous incident took place in November 2006 in Cleveland, where as the story goes, EoDM were getting booed and stormed off the stage without properly completing their set. Axl [Rose] apparently wasn’t thrilled with the band’s reaction, telling the audience when GN’R hit the stage, “So how’d you like the Pigeons of Shit Metal? Don’t worry, that’s the last show they’re playing with us.” And true to his word, EoDM were fired from the tour.“Every year … I have sent him a very sincere request – around Christmas time – inviting him to come in the studio and record two Christmas songs, and be released as the Pigeons of Shit Metal,” Hughes later said of his efforts to make amends with Rose. “And I always close it with a very judgmental, ‘Because I want you to know, Axl, I’m willing to forgive you, and I feel like the rest of the world is too.’ So I think that final statement he probably doesn’t appreciate too much.”Catch EODM (sans Axl Rose) on their upcoming European tour.

"Sheryl Crow plans to release what she’s previously called her “final album” later this summer. Though no firm details have been revealed, the record is said to feature a number of collaborations with the likes of Keith Richards, Stevie Nicks, and St. Vincent. Johnny Cash also appears from beyond the grave, dueting on a reworking of Crow’s 1996 track “Redemption Day”.Cash actually first encountered the song in 2003 after being introduced to it by his son-in-law. The Man in Black approached Crow about covering “Redemption Day”, but first drilled her about the depth of meaning. “He asked a lot of questions about different lines and what I meant,” Crow recalled in a press release. “He didn’t want to put his voice to the song without being able to believe it heart and soul.”He ended up recording his own take on the anti-war track, though it wasn’t released until after his death, appearing on 2010’s posthumous American VI: Ain’t No Grave. After playing alongside Cash’s rendition during her 2014 tour, Crow decided to take “Redemption Day” back into the studio to record a new duet version.The update comes to us via a music video directed by Shaun Silva that places shots of Crow at her piano in a field alongside images of the devastating history of war.

Now, she’s dropped its opening track, “Julien”, which admittedly has a lot of hype behind it.Why? Well, if you recall, her previous opening track, “Run Away with Me”, wound up being one of the strongest anthems off 2015’s E•MO•TION, setting the tone for the entire album.Granted, we’ve yet to hear the rest of Dedicated, but “Julien” at the very least serves as a sterling introduction to previously released cuts “No Drug Like Me” and “Now That I Found You”, both of which follow on the album in that order.Pre-order Dedicated, and stock up on Jepsen’s past vinyl releases here.

"Lizzo has today delivered her highly anticipated new album, Cuz I Love You. Stream the 11-track effort below.Cuz I Love You marks the Minneapolis genre-hoping pop artist’s debut on Nice Life/Atlantic Records. It’s her third full-length overall following 2013’s Lizzobangers and 2015’s Big GRRRL Small World. It was first previewed with the smash single “Juice”, which received a pair of incredible music videos. Other early singles included the title track and the Missy Elliott-featuring “Tempo”.Lizzo has often described the record as “if Aretha Franklin made a rap album.” It spreads across pop, rap, and R&B, with the polymath’s flute skills also on display. It’s also full of empowering messages, covering everything from feminism to body positivity. But to as Lizzo herself said in an Allure cover story, those labels aren’t movements to her — they’re just her:“The body-positive movement is the body-positive movement, and we high five. We’re parallel. But my movement is my movement. When all the dust has settled on the groundbreaking-ness, I’m going to still be doing this. I’m not going to suddenly change. I’m going to still be telling my life story through music. And if that’s body positive to you, amen. That’s feminist to you, amen. If that’s pro-black to you, amen. Because ma’am, I’m all of those things.”Listen to the powerful new record below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Lizzo will support Cuz I Love You on a massive tour that includes appearances at festivals like Primavera Sound, Summerfest, and Glastonbury.

Frontman Matt Shultz wrote much of the music while dealing with the dissolution of a personal relationship. In an exercise of self-examination, he used his lyrics to create characters who would “tell different parts of his personal story,” as a statement put it.The effort was previewed with a number of singles, including the Beck-featuring “Night Running”, “Ready to Let Go”, “House of Glass”, and the ballad “Goodbye”.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature that challenges artists to take an in depth look at the inspirations behind their latest single.Carriers, the project led by Cincinnati-based Curt Kiser, is already fairly well known amongst fellow indie artists. They’ve shared the stage with the likes of Big Thief and Damien Jurado, and Sharon Van Etten even gave them a shout out in the “Recommended listening” liner notes of her excellent Remind Me Tomorrow LP. Now, the band is finally ready to get on the listening public’s radar with their debut full-length, Now Is the Time for Loving Me, Yourself & Everyone Else.Due out August 23rd via Good Eye Records, the album has been some five years in the making. While Kiser has been playing many of these songs since first forming Carriers in 2014, they’ve only now made it into the studio. Helping him lock in the sound of the nine tracks were drummer Bryan Devendorf of The National and bassist John Curley of The Afghan Whigs.As a first listen, Carries have unveiled “Patience”, a track written way back at the very start of the band. With a grande, neo-psychedelia take on Americana akin to The War on Drugs, the song sweeps along like an old drop-top on a highway. “Overall it’s about appreciating what we have and remaining present, while still being able to have an honest perspective of the past and our future,” says Kiser. “I’m just trying to accept what happens and handle it the best I can.”Take a listen below.Pre-orders for Now Is the Time… are going on now. Below, see what went into the Origins of “Patience”, followed by the LP artwork and tracklist.Living Alone:I think this impacted writing this song for me. In my last two apartments I lived alone and it allowed me to focus on writing/recording in a different way. “It’s not always better on the other side.” Contentment in where I was at that point in my life helped me to realize the song. I think I’ve gotten to know myself better through living on my own. It also helps the creative flow not having to worry about keeping your roommates up at 3:00 a.m. when inspiration strikes.Ultrasuede Studio:“Patience” was one of the first tracks we recorded and working it out at John Curley’s studio was a huge part of this record happening at all. It was the foundation for the main tracking and overall vibe of the recording experience. We spent about two years working on it once a week, give or take a few when John or Bryan were out of town with the release of In Spades and Sleep Well Beast. The studio felt like a second home and was something I looked forward to every time we got in there. A truly beautiful, legendary studio with shag carpet, the coolest vintage amps, guitars and an old memory man that probably was used on every track. Sad that it’s now closed. RIP.The War on Drugs — Slave Ambient:This record by The War On Drugs was definitely influential and became a favorite from the very first listen. It’s a cruiser all the way through. Bryan knew the vibe I wanted when he came up with his drum parts for Patience and he made the beat his own. Dave Hartley has also become a friend through the process of recording this album which has been cool and his support has meant a lot to me.Prophet 8 (Synth World):This thing just makes so many sounds that I love to hear. The warbly oscillation bookends “Patience” and once it was added, I felt like we stepped into a cool territory that I loved and it became an integral piece to the flow of this record. We also did more overdubs with the Moog Opus 3 and the Korg Arp Odyssey thanks to Isaac Karns.Slow Transitions (Patience):I feel like patience has been the main word to sum up the last 10 years of my life. I didn’t go to college and had already decided I wanted to play music and travel. I’ve had a lot of great opportunities and have been able to tour and play music around the country which I’m super grateful for. With my first record though, it’s been a long process that has taught me a lot and I feel like I’ve really grown from the first night in the studio on July 16th, 2015 to now as I’m writing this, April 8th, 2019. So thankful to step into this new transition, releasing Carriers’ debut album.Dream Team (Good Friends):I truly couldn’t have done this without O.G. Carriers crew… Trent Becknell, Cory Pavlinac, Aaron Collins, and David Corns helping me work out these songs to play live. They gave me so much hope and encouragement. They’ve believed In me and my music. Then to have John Curley and Bryan Devendorf join me to make this record was truly a dream come true. I’ll be forever grateful to both of them and so glad to call them both good friends today.And finally Isaac Karns, who pushed me to record in the first place and helped me to finish this album doing overdubs at his studio and adding his unique touch to the record. Yeah, I love all the folks I get to work on music with. We’ve got a cool thing going in Cincinnati and I’m happy to be a part of it.Now Is the Time for Loving Me, Yourself & Everyone Else Artwork:Now Is the Time for Loving Me, Yourself & Everyone Else Tracklist:

"The eighth and final season of Game of Thrones is officially underway, and HBO is celebrating with a new album inspired by show. For the Throne is due out April 26th through Columbia Records and includes an impressive list of contributing artists, perhaps mighty enough to make those pesky White Walkers think twice about advancing south.Our first preview of the 14-track collection is titled “Power is Power” and comes from a formidable rap alliance of SZA, The Weeknd, and Travis Scott. Take a listen below.(Read: The Case for the White Walkers Winning the Game of Thrones)Check out the Game of Thrones scene on which the song’s titled may have been based.SZA and Scott collaborated previously on 2017’s “Love Galore”, while Scott and The Weeknd linked on “Wonderful” in 2016.For the Throne also includes new music from The National, Mumford and Sons, and Rosalía.

Additionally, the HBO series has featured cameos from Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, and Sigur Rós.Most recently, Game of Thrones and Fender teamed up to release a collection of $25,000 guitars inspired by each of the show’s different houses.

"From TikTok viral sensation to chart-smashing “non” country song, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” is officially one of the defining tracks of the year. Part meme, part record-breaking hit, the country rap tune has attracted scores of remixers and parodists. Now, Chicago MC CupcakKe has turned in her own twist on the song — and somehow we doubt it’ll be as big of a chart topper.The extremely X-rated remix has been redubbed “Old Town Hoe”, a title it wears with absolute pride. “I’m gonna take your dick, put it in my hole/ I’m gonna ride ’til I can’t no more,” she sings on the hook, possibly the cleanest line of the whole thing. There’s also a nod to Nicki Minaj’s technical issues during her guest appearance at Ariana Grande’s Coachella set: “On the dick, I rap, nigga/ Turnin’ his mic off like Nicki at Coachella, facts, yeah.”Maybe plug in some headphones if you’re in public, and take a listen below.",articles40,"['Lil Nas X’s', 'Nicki Minaj’s', 'Nicki']"
"The Hollywood Vampires, the supergroup consisting of shock rocker Alice Cooper, Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry, and actor-musician Johnny Depp, have revealed details of their sophomore album, which is titled Rise, and will arrive on June 21st. The band has also unleashed the first single, “Who’s Laughing Now” (stream below).The 16-song album will contain mostly originals, but will feature covers of David Bowie’s “Heroes”, Johnny Thunders’ “You Can’t Put Your Arms Around a Memory”, and the Jim Carroll Band’s “People Who Died”. The original track “Welcome to Bushwakers” features guest spots from guitar legend Jeff Beck and filmmaker John Waters.“Rise is not only a totally different animal than the first Vampires album, it is unique to anything I’ve ever been a part of,” said Cooper in a press release. “I approached it very differently than I usually do when working on an album. Each of us; Joe, Johnny, Tommy, and myself have written songs on this album.”He added, “What is different though is that I didn’t try to change any songs to be more ‘Alice-like.’ Because each of us has different influences, the sound of this album is very cool. I think that with this album, we are establishing what the Vampires’ sound really is, whereas with the first album, we were more tipping our hats to our fallen rock ‘n’ roll brothers.”Meanwhile, Perry stated, “Rise came from pure creative energy, which is just like playing live with the Vampires. The record showcases everyone doing what they do best without anyone looking over our shoulders. There was no pressure or deadlines, allowing us to write and record an album that is one of the freest and most honest sounding records I’ve been part of. I can’t wait to perform some of these tunes live for our fans.”The song “Who’s Laughing Now” is a hard-rocking tune that features vocals by Cooper on the verses, with singing by Depp on the chorus.

"Ahead of his second set at Coachella, Four Tet has revealed a new song. It’s dubbed “Teenage Birdsong” and follows last month’s wondrous “Only Human”.Clocking in a little over three minutes, “Teenage Birdsong” is led by gracefully dancing flute-like synths, proving that the woodwind instrument’s resurgence has a place beyond hip-hop. The track’s production picks up more in richness about halfway through, but it still has quite a calming effect — think of those ambient rainforest albums but reimagined by the mastermind producer.(Read: 20 Moments That Made Coachella What It Is Today)Check it out below.Four Tet’s first Coachella set was one of our festival highlights, as “the IDM pioneer crafted a steady and specific energy, never faltering from his commitment to specificity.” After his trip back to the California desert this weekend, the producer has some dates lined up in London, Brooklyn, and Denver, as well as scheduled festival appearances at Green Man in Wales and Melt! in Germany.

"With the release of the new Rammstein new album a month away, the German industrial metal act is offering up some new audio teases in the form of brief riffs from two new songs — “Radio” and “Zeig Dich” (listen below).The new snippets follow the full video for the first single, “Deutschland”, which was released in late March. The album, which is untitled, arrives May 17th, and marks the band’s first LP since 2009. It is available for pre-order here.Update 4/17: Rammstein have posted snippets of three more songs: “Ausländer”, “Sex”, and “Puppe”. Those can be heard below, as well.Regarding the new album, guitarist Richard Kruspe told us, “I think it’s going to be an album that has a certain kind of potential that Rammstein hasn’t achieved yet. For me, one of the reasons to step back into making records with Rammstein was to balance the popularity of the band as a live act with the actual music. With Rammstein, people tend to talk about the fire and all the live stuff. I thought, ‘I don’t want to be another KISS,’ where people talk about makeup and stuff like that and no one talks about the music.”In support of the album, Rammstein will embark on a European tour in June. Most shows are sold out, but tickets for select dates can be found here. Thus far, no North American dates have been announced.",articles40,"['Rammstein', 'Rammstein', 'Those', 'Richard Kruspe', 'Rammstein', 'Rammstein']"
"Origins is a recurring new music feature that challenges artists to take a closer look into the inspirations behind their latest single.There’s no greater rush than the sudden resurgence of freedom. When whatever it is that’s been holding you back — self-doubt, a failing relationship, a bad record contract — finally gets out of your way and you see the possibilities stretched out ahead of you, it’s the purest form of liberty. French-American pop artist Sydney Wayser, aka CLARA-NOVA, recently embraced that independence when a restrictive label deal finally ended.Wayser was so relieved and motivated by her newfound emancipation that she immediately dove back into songwriting. “Free” was the first thing she wrote after being “in a holding pattern waiting for the release from a record deal gone wrong.” As she explains it,“It had been a waiting game for almost nine months and this song came pouring out after I got an email saying I was in the clear to write, record and release music again! The song burst out of me, speeding and racing to the finish line and within a few hours the writing was complete. The song is about a jolt of fresh air, a burst of invincibility, an overwhelming joy and excitement for what’s ahead.”Produced by Lucius’ Dan Molad, “Free” is an airy alt-pop track designed for (and partially during!) top-down drives along coastal highways. It’s building layers are the aural embodiment of a weight being lifted, while the beating rhythm provides the driving force to press on to whatever comes next. “Seeing it all using my intuition/ Seconds to fall into a new position,” Wayser sings. “Good and I’m gone/ No need for ceremony.”Take a listen below.For more on how rides down the PCH and playing with tarot cards impacted “Free”, CLARA-NOVA has broken down the song’s Origins below.Pacific Coast Highway:I had taken a drive down the Pacific Coast Highway to clear my mind and started reflecting on the ocean’s permanence on one side and the fleeting life of plants, animals, people and cities on the other. The idea of mortality and appreciating the little joys of life we often take for granted fueled the song. Springtime daffodils blooming, waves crashing in and flowing out, the ocean breeze.Nordic Runes:There is a Nordic Rune, XX, called Inguz that translates to “the seed”. The concept behind this symbol is that we plant an idea in our subconscious mind and then our conscious mind brings it to fruition. I had been ruminating on the symbol and the lyrics “using my luck as a guide and not a compass” came out. It is about being present and going where I feel pulled rather than plotting a route that I feel I “need” to follow or is “right” to follow. Allowing myself to listen to my instincts and my gut responses. Trusting that I know where I want to be and that my conscious mind will bring it to fruition.Tarot Cards:I was pulling tarot cards for fun and for curiosity sake to see if I could relate to any of what came up. The funny thing that happened was I kept pulling the Hanged Man card which suggested suspension in time, surrender, metamorphosis and letting go. I guess in the end this whole song is about those themes.Dan Molad:My dear friend, Dan Molad, and I collaborated on the production of the song in his Silverlake studio. We had made my last solo record, Bell Choir Coast, together back in 2012 when we both lived in New York City. Now that his band Lucius is LA based as is CLARA-NOVA we decided to try out a few new songs and this one came together easily and quite magically in a few days. Dan is an absolute delight of a human and powerhouse of musical talent.",articles40,"['Sydney Wayser', 'CLARA-NOVA', '! The', 'Allowing', 'Dan Molad', 'Lucius', 'Dan']"
"Sad Planets is the new group from The Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney and John Petkovic of Cobra Verde and Death of Samantha fame. Their debut album, Akron, Ohio, named as a tribute to their hometown, is due out this Friday, April 19th.Following a pair of early singles, “Not of this World” and “Yesterday Girls”, comes today’s “Just Landed”. Described as a “psychedelic pop elegy” to an almost-forgotten place, it features lead guitar from special guest J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr..(Read: Ranking: Every Alternative Rock No. 1 Hit from Worst to Best)“J grabbed my guitar and just started playing along so we hit record,” Petkovic explained in a statement; he and Mascis alsos play together in the band Sweet Apple. “It sums up the entire process… we would come up with chords and songs on the spot.”Check out “Just Landed” below via its official music video.

"Bow to your Queen, Madonna has returned.Today, the blockbuster pop icon has delivered “Medellín”, the first single from her highly anticipated fourteenth studio album, Madame X.Featuring Colombian singer Maluma, the reggaeton track offers a portrait of Madonna’s new identity Madame X, which she’s described as “a secret agent traveling around the world, changing identity, fighting for freedom, and bringing light to dark places.”Well, she certainly travels. “I took a sip and had a dream,” she sings, “and woke up in Medellín.” The whole “one, two” lyric is catchy as hell, but this is a track that thrives from meandering, as if she’s swimming around the very waters of the titular location.Stream below and catch up on her catalogue now.Madame X is due out June 14th va Interscope Records. The standard edition boasts 13 tracks and features additional collaborations with Migo’s Quavo and Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee, along with production from Diplo and Mike Dean. A deluxe edition tacks on two bonus tracks.(Read: Madonna’s Top 20 Songs)In an interview with Vogue Italia last year, Madonna said her next album was inspired by Portugal, where she lived throughout the process of its creation (via EW). A press release provides further details:Influenced creatively by living in Lisbon, Portugal over the past several years, Madame X is a collection of 15 new songs that celebrate Madonna’s career-long affair with Latin music and culture as well as other global influences. Singing in Portuguese, Spanish and English, highlights on the album include ‘Medellín’” which was co-produced by Mirwais and captures the spirit of Maluma’s hometown, the anthemic song ‘I Rise’, the Jamaican dancehall vibes of ‘Future’ featuring Quavo, and co-produced by Diplo, as well as the sonically innovative Mirwais produced ‘Dark Ballet’. Recorded over 18 months in Portugal, London, New York and Los Angeles, Madonna collaborated on Madame X with longtime producer Mirwais, as well as with producers Mike Dean and Diplo, among others.Madame X Artwork:Madame X Tracklist:

"Iowa-based psych/stoner metallers Druids have been going strong for a decade now, and they’re set to unleash their latest album, Monument, this Friday (April 19th). Better yet, the metal trio has teamed up with Heavy Consequence to offer a full stream of the album in advance of its release (listen below).Frontman Luke Rauch tells us of the album, “Monument is based on the idea of balance. I was mentally and physically a mess for such a long time that I felt it was normal. Once I found steady mental ground through yoga and practicing a positive mental attitude, I realized that pushing myself creatively became easier.”He adds, “The last five years has served as a transitional period for us creatively and personally. I feel that the record is a reflection of our growth.”Monument contains a total of five tracks, with the album centering on an overall theme of the afterlife, as each song takes the listener on a journey of the mystical worlds that the story’s protagonist encounters after death.Druids have a few shows scheduled for April, including a hometown gig on April 20th at Wooly’s in Des Moines, Iowa, before embarking on a two-week tour in June (see the dates below). The new album can be pre-ordered via Bandcamp, with exclusive multi-colored vinyl available via The Company KC.Take a listen to Druids’ Monument album in the YouTube playlist below.Monument Artwork:Monument Tracklist:

"Tycho are back today with new music along with the announcement of a new label. Scott Hansen’s electronic project last released an album in 2016 with EPOCH, which came via his longtime label partner Ghostly International. After an amicable departure, he’s now signed with Mom + Pop Music and Ninja Tune for a yet-untitled full-length due out later this year.Though details on the LP aren’t currently available, we do have our first tease of the record. “Easy” is a perfectly titled track, as there’s a serenity to the song’s drive. Even with a quick and snappy groove skittering beneath the layers of airy synths, there’s a peaceful essence to the whole thing. Which well fits Hansen’s objective with the piece, as he explained in a press release,“Music can transport us to other realities but can also ground us firmly within ourselves. After a trilogy of records spent exploring the outer reaches of experience I am focusing inward to reveal a human side to the music… My journey as an artist has been defined by an iterative cycle with each album building on and refining an overarching vision. ‘Easy’ is about coming to terms with my past and defining a clear vision moving forward. It’s a comforting voice that reminds you not to get so lost in the work, but to take it easy and enjoy the ride. ‘Easy’ is the bridge to the future.”Take a listen below.In addition to more information about the new album, Tycho promise a full round of tour dates coming in the near future.

"Flying Lotus has announced his first album in nearly five years. The You’re Dead! follow-up is titled Flamagra and due to hit shelves May 24th through Warp Records.The forthcoming effort spans a very generous 27 tracks, and boasts a long list of prominent collaborators, new and old. David Lynch, George Clinton, Thundercat, Anderson .Paak, Solange, and Shabazz Palaces make appearances on the LP, as do Toro y Moi, Tierra Whack, Little Dragon, and Denzel Curry.(Read: The Top Albums of 2014)With a varied guest list and the guidance of Flying Lotus, it should come as no surprise that Flamagra draws on hip-hop, funk, soul, jazz, global dance music, and even IDM. A press release describes it as perhaps “the definitive” FlyLo record, “an astral afro-futurist masterpiece of deep soul, cosmic dust, and startling originality.”In a statement, FlyLo (né Steven Ellison) talked about the role of fire in his vision for the new album:“I’d been working on stuff for the past five years, but it was always all over the place. I’d always had this thematic idea in mind — a lingering concept about fire, an eternal flame sitting on a hill. Some people love it, some people hate it. Some people would go on dates there and some people would burn love letters in the fire.”As a first listen of the LP, FlyLo has shared “Fire is Coming”, his collaboration with Lynch. The song is definitely not a Game of Thrones pun, though its FlyLo-directed video features rabid children and Lynch dressed up as some kind of canine storyteller/soothsayer. You’ll have to see it for yourself.Check it out below, followed by the album artwork and tracklist.Flamagra Artwork:Flamagra Tracklist:

"When you put out one of the best albums of the year, you’d think highlighting it throughout the promotional cycle would be a priority. But despite dropping the masterful Negro Swan just last year, Blood Orange is already looking ahead to what’s next. During his appearance on the Late Late Show with James Corden on Tuesday night, the artist aka Dev Hynes chose to debut a pair of new songs.The first, “Something to Do” is more of a short interlude. Chilling on a patch of astroturf, Hynes plucked out a reverberating strain while his quartet of backing singers were “waiting for something to lose.” The notes blended smoothly into “Dark & Handsome”, a soft and snappy number of staccato vocals. Check out both songs by watching Blood Orange’s performance below.Blood Orange is currently in California between Coachella appearances, with a show alongside Christine and the Queens in Santa Barbara set for Thursday before he returns to Indio for weekend two. He opened his weekend one set with a cover of Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold”, so who knows what he’ll bring for the next round.

"Kash Doll has been steadily rising the ranks of hip-hop over the last few years. Videos for her singles like “Ice Me Out”, “For Everybody”, and “Check” have racked up millions of hits, while she’s also received co-signs from Drake, Meek Mill, Rick Ross, and others. But the Detroit MC has been hustling since long before that, earning her first big bucks as a dancer. Her latest track, “Hustla”, harkens back to those days in a cautionary tale about the dark side of dancing for money.With a subtle and steady beat behind her, Kash raps a narrative like the hip-hop yarns of ol’. Here, a girl named Kelly serves as the protagonist, a dancer who gets caught up with a stack-heavy shiner named Dre. When Dre comes up with a scheme to double their bank by setting up another hustler, things take a devastating turn.According to a press release, Kelly is based on a girl Kash herself knew back in her club days. The “Hustla” video is the first in a planned series called the “Kelly Chronicles” that seeks to shine a light on the dangerous underbelly of stripping. As Kash puts it,“‘Kelly Chronicles’ is a story based on things I’ve seen in the real world strip club life, although thankfully it’s not my own experience. I wanted to show girls that it’s not all glitz and glamour. Sometimes women sacrifice their peace of mind, dignity and most importantly self-worth. ‘Kelly Chronicles’ will be an ongoing story. As a former dancer, I used to be in that world, and I want girls to know it’s not just what you see on social media. There are stories of missing girls with cases still open because of situations like these. With this mini movie series, I’m speaking on situations that come from living that lifestyle. There is a lot of peer pressure and you can easily get led in the wrong direction. I want to give these women a voice, and make sure these stories and cautionary tales are told.”Watch the (slightly not safe for work) Nimi Hendrix-directed video below.",articles40,"['Kash Doll', 'Rick Ross', 'Chronicles’']"

During the duo’s inaugural tour, they covered a different track each night that was related to the city in which they were in, including songs like Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “Shallow”, Death Cab for Cutie’s “Title and Registration”, The Replacements’ “Can’t Hardly Wait”, and The Killers’ “Human”. They even found the time to perform a new original song.Despite being over 25 years deep in his music career, Oberst still seems to write new material with ease. While he technically shared new music earlier this year in the shape of Better Oblivion Community Center’s debut self-titled album, his real last record was Salutations, which came out in 2017.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature that requests artists take a closer look into the inspirations behind their most recent track.Although barely 21 years of age, Briston Maroney has already seen both the inspiring beauty and cutthroat ugliness of the music industry. However, through it all — the vagabond beginnings, multiple relaunches of his career, resettling in Nashville, and even a turn auditioning for American Idol — one thing has remained Maroney’s guiding light: his commitment to his dream.Thanks to his long-standing dedication, Maroney has been able to finally, truly answer his calling as a rock ‘n’ roll troubadour. We heard him showcase this on last fall’s Carnival EP, and he’s set to continue carving out his path on the forthcoming Indiana EP, due out May 17th.The four-track effort is being led with a track called “Caroline”, which, rather aptly, is all about ambition and persistence when it comes to one’s aspirations. “Got big dreams and an attitude/ Everything you need/ What you need to do is go/ Just go,” Maroney urges on the single, his voice vulnerable and empathetic, but balanced out with just the right amount of conviction to ward off detractors.Check out “Caroline” below via its official music video. Helmed by Joey Brodnax, it features home video recordings and footage.Aside from his own dreams, Maroney tells Consequence of Sound that “Caroline” was also inspired by Michael Cera, a special venue in Nashville, and grandmas all over the world. Read on below for the track’s complete Origins.Michael Cera:Around 14 years old, I started doing my own deep digging into music and movies to find any source of confirmation that I was not alone as a strange, sensitive kid. I found a lot of solace in independent movies and their often wimpy or broken heroes. Michael Cera was in peak performance at the time, and after seeing Juno, Superbad, and Youth in Revolt within a year period of time, he quickly became the perfect archetype to make me feel cool while wearing tight polo shirts given to me by my aunt. “Caroline” is my letter to the kid just like me who needs a little motivation to get through the day, coming from a pretty imperfect influence like myself.The East Room in Nashville:The story of “Caroline” stemmed from an actual person I saw from a distance but never met while playing a show at one of my favorite Nashville venues, The East Room. There were probably 20 people at the show, all of whom looked indifferent to every act. The one person who really caught my attention was a young girl about 8-9 years old standing front row, grinning ear to ear. Her interest and fascination with the music reminded me so much of myself at her age that I walked to the parking lot and wrote a song in the honor of a kid I’d never met, but deserves to be told her innocent love for music is beautiful, and exactly what the world needs right now!!!Birds:I really do just love birds man. I played the song for the first time to my roommate Austin on a sunny day in Nashville. We walked outside with our dog Townes after I played it and were greeted by lots of happy little chirping birdies. I took it as a sign that the recording of “Caroline” should carry on their song, being my attempt to sing to them, the way they sang their sweet, sweet birdie songs to me.Grandmas around the world:A majority of the music video for “Caroline” is a combination of home video recordings and footage captured in director Joey Brodnax’s home town in Arkansas. Throughout the whole filming process, Joey’s parents and maternal grandmother were around to lend a helping hand. Joey’s grandmother made sure that not a single second went by in which we were even partially hungry or not taken care of. I will never forget eating cookies and drinking coffee with his grandmother on her back porch in between takes. I also will not forget the soup she made 30 minutes after that. Or the fried catfish that she served us an hour after that.Indiana Artwork: Indiana Tracklist:

"Rachel Goswell likes to spread her talents around. Besides her main role in Slowdive, she’s a member of the supergroup Minor Victories, and recently contributed to albums from Beach Fossils, American Football, and Mercury Rev. She’s keeping her latest project close to home, however, as she’s teamed with her new husband, Steve Clarke, to form The Soft Cavalry.Clarke and Goswell met while he was tour managing Slowdive during their 2014 reunion. Four years later, they were married, and Clarke had found inspiration to start working on his own music.“I’d always had ideas but never felt that anything I had to say was worthy of anyone’s attention, let alone my own,” he said in a press release. “I wish that I could have done this fifteen years ago but, in reality, I simply couldn’t have. But I’m not one to overly wallow. I’d rather plough the various levels of confusion into songs.”As The Soft Cavalry, the duo will release their self-titled debut on July 5th via Bella Union. “Dive” marks the first listen to the effort, a daydream of a track that finds Clarke and Goswell quietly reckoning with their complicated emotions.

"The tragic passing of The Cranberries’ Dolores O’Riordan last year came as the band was in the studio working on a new album. In tribute to the singer, her bandmates will release these final recordings as an 11-track album entitled In the End, due out April 26th.Today, The Cranberries have unveiled the album’s title track, which was the final song recorded with O’Riordan prior to her passing. Appropriately, it is the final track appearing on In the End.“What a way to finish the record. To have ‘In The End’ as the last song is just perfect,” says drummer Fergal Lawler in a statement. “Lyrically it is self-explanatory,” adds guitarist Noel Hogan. “It speaks for itself, it just is a lovely feeling and it’s a gorgeous song.”Take a listen to the song below.The Cranberries previously previewed In the End with the release of “All Over Now” and “Wake Me When It’s Over”.

"Open Mike Eagle is teaming with comedian Baron Vaughn for a new Comedy Central variety show called The New Negroes. The weekly series will feature multiple stand-up sets and close with a new original song and music video by OME in collaboration with different music guests.Ahead of its series premiere later this week, OME has shared his first track for The New Negroes. It’s dubbed “Unfiltered” and finds him working with Detroit rapper Danny Brown.(Read: The Top TV Shows of 2018)In the clip, OME’s day at the office ends in disaster when his inner voice (played by Brown) makes itself known to his fellow coworkers. Check it out below.The New Negroes takes its title and theme from Alain Locke’s similarly titled book of “essays, poetry, fiction, and music from a generation of emerging artists credited with launching the Harlem Renaissance.” OME added:“In other words, it was a place where black people shared their lives, their perspectives, and their ideals. It was a place where black people could define themselves instead of being defined by others. Our show aspires to do the same with stand-up comedy, music, and music videos.”The variety show airs Friday, April 19th at 11:00 p.m. ET, with a simulcast on both Comedy Central and BET. Comedians Hannibal Buress and Sasheer Zamata are expected to turn in sets throughout the season, while Lizzo, Method Man, MF Doom are slated to hit the studio with OME.OME dropped his What Happens When I Try to Relax EP in 2018, while his last proper full-length, Brick Body Kids Still Daydream, came the year before that. Grab all of his vinyl releases here.As for Brown, the MC’s Atrocity Exhibition hit shelves way back in 2016; purchase that LP and his past vinyl releases over here.

It’s dubbed Hyperspace and follows the Grammy-winning Colors from 2017.A statement doesn’t list an official release date for the new LP, only that it is due out at “an as yet undetermined point in the space time continuum.” Despite the mysteriousness surrounding the record, Beck has treated eager fans to the record’s first single, “Saw Lightning”.(Read: A Running List of Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame Omissions)The new track sees Beck teaming up with Pharrell Williams, who provided songwriting and production assistance, as well as contributions on drums, keyboards, and mumbled vocals.

"Los Angeles-based industrial act 3Teeth will unleash their third album, Metawar, on July 5th, and they’ve teamed up with Heavy Consequence to debut the eye-catching video for the new single “American Landfill” (watch below).3Teeth have made some major noise since releasing their debut LP in 2014, opening for the likes of Tool, Rammstein, and Danzig. Metawar is being produced by Sean Beavan (Nine Inch Nails, Marilyn Manson) and marks the band’s first album under a new record deal with RED Music.The video for “American Landfill” was directed by Matthew Santoro, whose credits include visual effects on X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Incredible Hulk, 300, and many other films. He also happens to be a longtime friend of 3Teeth frontman Alexis Mincolla.“The director, Matthew Charles Santoro, has been my best friend since 4th grade, so it was really cool to finally be able to work on something together,” says Mincolla. “We wanted to make an homage to the ‘90s action movies we grew up on but we also wanted to make an allegory that touched on today’s concepts of surveillance, cyberspace, and exploring the relationship between reality and simulation.He continues, “To me the landfill represents a giant sentient data dump who’s algorithmic understanding is just trapping you in the echo chamber of your very own inescapable memetic conception camp. It doesn’t matter if it’s cyberspace or reality, no one escapes the ‘American Landfill.’”Pre-orders for 3Teeth’s Metawar album are available here, while the band’s tour dates with Ministry can be seen below.Watch the “American Landfill” video below (mobile and tablet users may have to hold device horizontally for optimal viewing):3Teeth 2019 Tour Dates With Ministry:

"It’s easy to get precious about nostalgia. As you enter your early 30s, though, the distance from unanxious youth becomes all the more distinct. It becomes easier to be wistful for your teenage years when you’re separated from them by two-fold. So when now 32-year-old Ellie Goulding sings of being “Sixteen” on her new single, there’s a palpable sincerity.“Time/ Suddenly we got no time,” the British pop star sings over a simply produced electro beat. “We’re so busying doing life/ That I miss your eyes on mine.” It’s a reminder that we 30-somethings can still feel a bit of magic so long as we remind ourselves that it didn’t just disappear because we grew up.Speaking of the track in a press release, Goulding said,“I’m so excited to share ‘Sixteen’ with everyone. That age was such a pivotal year for me in many ways and this song is so close to my heart. It takes me back to the reckless days of being a teenager and I hope it reminds us all about the innocence of youth.”Take a listen via the lyric video below.

"Anderson .Paak has premiered his new album, Ventura. Stream it in full below via Apple Music or Spotify.Ventura comes to us less than six months after .Paak’s solid entry Oxnard. The 11-track effort was recorded at the same time as its predecessor, and again finds Dr. Dre overseeing the project as executive producer. Also much like Oxnard, the new LP was inspired by .Paak’s early days spent in SoCal:“Growing up in Oxnard gave me the grit and the church to find this voice of mine. One town over I went further and found my depth. The duality of each place inspired me greatly and from that I made two albums at the exact same time but held one back because that would have been too many songs to perform live for you all! I like ending things on an even number so welcome to Ventura.”(Read: 20 Essential Coachella Acts to Catch on Tour This Spring)Along with Dr. Dre, Ventura boasts contributions from André 3000, late rapper Nate Dogg, Jazmine Sullivan, Brandy, and Lalah Hathaway.

"Mark Ronson has officially announced his latest studio album. It’s titled Late Night Feelings and is due out June 21st via Sony Music.Back in November, we heard the album’s first single, “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” feat. Miley Cyrus, and now he’s unleashed its Lykke Li-featuring title track. Those who love to sad dance should have no qualms with this one. Over a delectable island beat, Li croons, “Make me psychotic, you pull away/ You take the sane in me/ And tear it like a page.”Ouch. Rest assured, it’s worth the bruises, and will likely slot in as a scorching contender for this year’s Song of the Summer, a discussion that’s already well underway among critics and fans alike. Stream below you sad bastard you. Update April 23rd: The JP CHARTRAND-directed video for “Late Night Feelings” has been released, and you can watch it below.In addition to Cyrus and Li, the recently announced tracklist also includes previously confirmed features by Camila Cabello, King Princess, YEBBA, and Alicia Keys. Sadly, there’s no mention of HAIM, The Roots, or Howard Stern, which makes you wonder if this album has the “hit song” he teased back in January.Speculate away with the tracklist below — well, after the cover artwork.Late Night Feelings Artwork:Late Night Feelings Tracklist:

"Instrumental post-metal quartet Pelican have announced their first full-length album in six years. The LP, Nighttime Stories, arrives June 7th via Southern Lord, and the band has released the lead single, “Midnight and Mescaline” (stream below).The single hints at a return to Pelican’s darker, cathartic early output. “Midnight and Mescaline” is a sonic tapestry of interwoven passages, fusing elements of post-hardcore and psych along with Pelican’s signature metal tones. The song’s entertaining buildup goes from melodic guitar lines to blastbeat speeds and angular breakdowns, finally ending with a chugging groove. The single will be available on Record Store Day as a 7-inch with an exclusive B-side “Darkness on the Stairs”.“I feel like the music we make, and particularly this record, I feel like a lot of the chord voicings and the way the songs are structured are very discordant, and maybe more menacing and negative sounding than Pelican has been in the past,” guitarist Trevor Shelley de Brauw said in an interview with The Fader. “I know that, obviously, we’re a metal band, which has always been part of the DNA, but at one point in press materials, we referred to ourselves as ‘a triumphant band’ or something, because we were much more into this expression of hope. Which we still are, but I think this particular set of material sounds dark and negative because there’s a purging quality to these songs.”He added: “We’re collecting our negativity in this musical zone and pushing it out as a positive release. It’s a catharsis.”Nighttime Stories is inspired by a series of personal tragedies and is a tribute to Jody Minnoch, who unexpectedly passed away in 2014. Minnoch fronted the band Tusk alongside Pelican members Trevor Shelley de Brauw, drummer Larry Herweg, and former guitarist Laurent Lebec. Nighttime Stories was going to be the title for a Tusk album but went unused, and Pelican also used Minnoch’s notes for the song titles on the new album.The album also marks the band’s first release written front-to-back with guitarist Dallas Thomas, who replaced Lebec in 2013. During this time, Thomas mourned the death of his father. For the album’s opening track “WST”, he pays tribute by performing his part on his dad’s Yahama acoustic guitar.Since drummer Larry Herweg and his bassist brother, Brian Herweg, moved to L.A., the band has worked together from afar, sharing riffs over Dropbox. After assembling out their core ideas, the band would meet in person to flesh out the songs and eventually record.“None of these songs really gelled until we were in a room together,” Shelley de Braw said in the interview.Pelican convenes once again for a 10-day U.S. tour alongside Cloakroom. Those dates are below, and further tour dates are in the works for later in the year. Nighttime Stories is available for pre-order here.Nighttime Stories Artwork:Nighttime Stories Tracklist:

"Lizzo is just days away from unleashing her new album, Cuz I Love You. However, while promoting the project, the Minneapolis rapper has been showcasing much more than just her own music.During various in-studio sessions over the last few weeks, Lizzo has been turning in stunning cover after stunning cover. We heard her offer up gospel reimagining of Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson’s “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” for the BBC, followed by a vocally powerful “Shallow” rendition on SiriusXMU. Lizzo’s latest reimagining took place on Elvis Duran Live and involved the Ariana Grande mega hit “7 Rings”.(Read: 20 Essential SXSW Acts to Catch on Tour)Lizzo was backed only by an acoustic guitar, and she even provided her own handmade (literally) percussion. Despite the bare-bones accompaniment, she successfully infused it with her own style of swagger especially when tweaking its lyrics: “You like my hair? New weave, just bought it.”Per MTV, Grande praised Lizzo’s rendition via Instagram Story, writing, “this made my whole day. @lizzobeeating i love u so much.”Watch Lizzo’s Grande-approved “7 Rings” cover below.Here’s the original version:Cuz I Love You lands in stores April 19th. Lizzo is scheduled to perform at Coachella this weekend, which will then be followed by a North American tour. Grab your tickets here.“7 Rings” is off Grande’s thank u, next album.

"Track by Track is a new music feature in which we give an artist the opportunity to dig deep into each song on their latest full-length release, one by one.In contrast to the urgent anxiety of their post-rock, Bars of Gold are a leisured bunch. Both their lives and their music are carefully measured, but the former also means the latter often takes longer than fans may hope for. Over the last six years, they’ve worked on grounding themselves by forming families, cultivating their friendships, and building their new rehearsal space after their last one got washed out during a superstorm in the summer of 2014. Now, after all that patience and perseverance, they’re ready to unleash their new album SHELTERS.Before making the new album, someone suggested they shed one of their three guitarists. But Bars of Gold is built on the bonds between their musical family, so instead of reducing their numbers, they fortified them by adding a fourth guitarist in John Gaviglio. Added to the ranks of Detroit instrumental jammers Wildcatting (guitarists Ben Audette and Scotty Iulianelli, with bassist Nick Jones) and members of Bear vs. Shark (guitarist/vocalist Marc Paffi and drummer Brandon Moss), Gaviglio brought yet another layer of affirming maximalism.Another testament to their unhurried approach to making music, some of the songs on SHELTERS date 10 years to the earliest days of the band. Others are inspired by the confidence and appreciation the members drew from becoming fathers. All of them capture the dynamic intensity and bellowing vocals of a group of friends clearly meant to make songs together — however long it takes.Ahead of the album’s official release tomorrow, April 12th, stream the entire thing below.For a more in depth examination of the SHELTERS, Paffi and Moss have broken it down Track by Track. Check out what they each have to say below.“Worthless Chorus”:
I have to be honest, this is a 70s rock song with an ending that makes me want to crawl in a swamp (that’s a good thing). It was a natural first song on the record. — Marc PaffiIt was originally a much slower funk/rock song, that I imagined would have a super long, repetitive and hypnotizing middle section. It got churned through “BOG machine” and presto(!), a sweet first song. Koltay suggested we add some additional vocals from Julie (his wife) and her sister Loretta (they both also sang on Wheels), and they killed it with their singing at end. — Brandon Moss“Atlantic City”:
This is a song about loyalty and commitment. Really loyalty and commitment in any kind of relationship. Brandon recorded this drum beat and my initial thought was, “I’m gonna try to write a pop song to this insanity.” It sounds like someone recorded a boot in a dryer. I love it. — MPScotty said it’s something like an “unsuspecting pop song made up of seemingly disjointed parts. [To him], it’s our version Beefheart’s “Frownland”. For me, it’s this idea of having these weird circular beats, that I’m sure trained musicians aren’t exactly playing, but rhythms I nonetheless definitely hear in music. It’s like sometimes you think you know what someone is playing musically and then you see them do it, and you were completely off. I’ve used Steve Reich’s Music for 18 Musicians as my go-to “baby calming record” (thanks for soothing my upset spawn, Steve Reich ♥️). But, after seeing the composition live a few years ago, I definitely misinterpreted what was going on. Nonetheless, I had a bunch of good ideas flowing from it despite how off I was. The drumbeat for this song was one of them. — BM“$20”:
This song makes me have to dance… Not “want” to dance but have to. It’s got Scotty written all over it. His initial guitar power funk part drills holes in my brain every time we play it. — MPRight after we built our current practice spot, Scotty and I were messing around, and he asked me to play my “favorite drum beat.” There was this one live version of “There Was a Time” by James Brown that used to blow my mind, because I couldn’t figure out what the drummer was doing. I came to find out that it was two drummers playing, which why it’s so crazy to listen to. This song’s drum beat is my interpreted (or misinterpretation?) of what James Brown & the JBs played. — BM“Sometimes”:
“Sometimes” is a total krautrock song to me. Lyrically this song means a lot to me. I’m singing about mental illness and trying to harness the positive and negative of going in and out of an episode. — MPThis is one of those times when a song essentially wrote itself. I had a idea for a drum beat, that crashed swimmingly with everyone else’s ideas of the song. The idea was to keep it tight and tense, but with a chorus that sounds like you’re falling down a giant set of stairs. We kept trying to make it a much longer song, but it just seemed right as it is. — BM“Beans”:
I luuuuuuuv playing this song live. It really captures what I think is the core of the record. Grooves. Brandon’s drum fillers on this song are fucking incredible. Actually the drums are the shit in general. It reminds me of an OutKast song (which is probably why I love it so much). Ben’s guitar part in the “chorus” is amazing to me as well. It makes me want to put on a swimsuit. — MPI think it was Scotty who had us listening to Mystikal or something, that it got us thinking all these odd pieces of songs we had. They odd pieces seemed to meshed so well together, so we threw things at a wall and this is what stuck together. Another weird practice experiment that actually stuck around. Totally dig it! — BM“Madonna”:
Insanity. So hard trying to time coming into the verses with Brandon. You can hear it on the recording as well. That’s the beauty of this one. The anxiety that builds and releases!! — MPI’m pretty sure we wrote this in a single practice (which is rare for us — we pick at song a lot). The idea was to definitely to keep this song tense and running. — BM“Montana”:
In all honesty, Montana is one of my favorite states in the country. That’s all I have to say on this track — MPMarc and I wrote this song together in my basement way over 10 years ago, before Bars of Gold was even an idea. It was nice, Marc would come over and we’d just play, with really no goal other than just playing. This song was a product of that free jamming. It was such a solid gem that we’ve kicked around doing something with for awhile. Sometimes songs need to stew for a bit. — BM“Plywood to Pine”:
If you can imagine building a house and having that house take ten years to build, that’s this song. The additions of the horns and finally putting structure on it was the key. Koltay really helped on this one. The lyrics are about doing manual labor. Actually a lot of the lyrics on this record focus on labor or the act of working. I tend to sing about that a lot. — MPThis song was originally an old Wildcatting song that was apparently too fast, spastic and too crazy, even for us. I don’t think it originally had lyrics and then when Marc added his, it upped the ante on how wild it was. It was a bit too much, so we had to let this one simmer for a little bit. Koltay helped us give it more of a groove, which is what we were looking for. Plus, it finally gave us an in on getting that MC5 Starship/Sun Ra ending that we’ve aiming to do for awhile. — BM“G”:
We all love the Talking Heads ( well, everyone in Bars of Gold). This is a song about becoming a father. — MPThis was the first song we accidentally wrote for this record. We stopped playing together for a little bit in the middle of 2014/2015. Life just continues on, and it can be difficult to restart old things unless you have a solid reason. Koltay asked us to play his wedding, which got us playing together again (also, we learned some pretty solid covers :)). After his wedding, we felt like it’d be silly to not continue on and write another record. We wrote this song around that time, so to me, this song is about a new beginning, which makes it a perfect song to end the record. — BM",articles40,"['Track', 'Scotty Iulianelli', 'Nick Jones', 'Bear vs. Shark', 'Others', 'SHELTERS', 'Track', 'Chorus', 'I’m', 'Steve Reich', 'Musicians', 'Steve Reich', 'Grooves', 'Brandon’s', 'Ben’s', 'Mystikal', 'Bars of Gold', 'Marc', 'Life']"
"Los Angeles’ own Bleached have finally returned with their first music since 2017.The offering, titled “Shitty Ballet”, sees Jessica and Jennifer Clavin trading in their electric and crunchy garage rock for a more featherweight sound made with acoustic guitars.

"After polishing off his multifaceted persona as someone who acts in films and pulls strangers from burning cars in real life, Chance the Rapper is back to what he does best: rapping (though he’s a pretty good husband, too).Chance the Rapper and Lil Yachty have shared a new collaborative single called “Atlanta House Freestyle”. It’s the first time the two have teamed up to record music together since Chance released Coloring Book, which featured Lil Yachty and Young Thug on the song “Mixtape”.In “Atlanta House Freestyle”, the two walk in step rhythmically. Fuzzed-out bass beats fade into a dreary beat while Yachty runs his lines, going so fast it barely sounds like he’s taking breaths. Chance follows in his footsteps, treading through monotone verses that keep the hypnotic pace going. Listen below to see for yourself.That’s not the only new song Chance appears on either; Chicago rapper Supa Bwe shared a new single called “Rememory” that sees Chance rapping over a smooth beat. The song comes off of Bwe’s Just Say Thank You EP that he released yesterday. Add it to the long list of collaborations Chance the Rapper gets up to in his free time. A month ago, 2 Chainz asked him and Kodak Black to appear on “I’m Not Crazy, Life Is” off his new album, Rap or Go to the League.“Rememory” begins with a hazy beat that feels like a jazz piano dream. Eventually, Chance’s mellow flow breaks through, clearing out the smoke to wonder what life is like without the person you love. It’s a warm, gentle track to usher in the warming weather. Check it out below.While Chance has been busy appearing on other artist’s songs, he hasn’t been as busy releasing music of his own. The last proper albums he dropped were Merry Christmas Lil’ Mama in 2016 and, of course, Coloring Book earlier that same year. Thankfully Chance will have a new album on the way, which means his performance at Woodstock 2019 will liven up the otherwise confusing lineup for the festival’s 50th anniversary.

"Jesca Hoop has announced a new solo album called STONECHILD. Due out July 5th via Memphis Industries, the record follows 2017’s Memories Are Now.The effort marks the first time the Iron & Wine collaborator has recorded somewhere other than California. Determined to “step out of my comfort zone” for the sessions, Hoop stayed in England, heading south of her Manchester home to Bristol. There, she entered the studio with producer John Parish (PJ Harvey, This is the Kit), whose minimalistic approach led to a beautifully simplified presentation of Hoop’s vision.In a press release, Hoop jokingly described Parish as “a gentle collaborator until he killed one of my darlings.” “I’ve never been so brutally edited, and I wasn’t shy about expressing my discomfort at the sight of my work on the cutting room floor,” she added. “He said, you will forgive me, and in some way I think I actually enjoyed that treatment… being stripped back to the bare basics… albeit painfully”.Lead single “Shoulder Change” serves as our first listen to STONECHILD. Featuring Lucius on backing vocals and harmonies, the stirring track addresses cultural stigmatization and the damage caused by ignoring how “we are actually and truly the same… even in our differences,” as Hoop put it. “To understand all is to forgive all.” Take a listen below.Other album guests include Kate Stables of This is the Kit and Rozi Plain. Pre-orders are going on now, while a very limited Dinked Edition pressed onto black-and-white marbled vinyl in a mirror board sleeve and packaged with a flexidisc featuring bonus track “Waking Andreas” will be available at select indie store.

"Silversun Pickups have announced their first album in four years, Widow’s Weeds. Serving as the follow-up to 2014’s Better Nature, the 10-track effort is out June 7th via the band’s own New Machine Recordings.Marking the Pickups’ fifth full-length overall, Widow’s Weeds was recorded with the help of producer Butch Vig. Collaborating with Vig had been on the group’s to-do list for years, and their desire to make an “extroverted, confident album” drove them to finally link up with the Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana associate.While working together proved fruitful, it also created a bit of a scheduling issue. The sessions had to be split in two, as Vig had already lined up commitments to tour with Garbage. During the downtime between recording, keyboardist Joe Lester’s father died, and frontman Brian Aubert found himself in the throes of depression-fueled drinking. After Aubert entered treatment and committed to sobriety, he was able to approach songwriting with renewed clarity.As he explained in a press release,“The record does have a mourning vibe, but it’s not sad. It’s change. It’s growing up and moving on and letting go of things. And it’s okay to be sad about those things and mourn them. It’s actually healthy to do so and take the time to do it. At the end of the day, it’s going to be much better and much more fulfilling when you get through it.”The first single off Widow’s Weeds is the urgent “It Doesn’t Matter Why”. Needling guitar work and a springing rhythm propel the song through it’s anxiety-riddled quest for catharsis. The track comes via a video directed by Suzie Vlcek, which you can watch below.Pre-orders for Widow’s Weeds are going on now, and you can purchase past Silversun Pickup releases on vinyl here.Widow’s Weeds Artwork:Widow’s Weeds Tracklist:

"It was announced last week that a new posthumous Avicii album would be hitting stores this summer. TIM, named after the super star producer (né Tim Bergling), is being teased today with the first single.“SOS” is a summer-ready cut that features guest vocals from R&B singer Aloe Blacc. The collaboration seems like a fitting and full-circle-type of inclusion for the new album, considering Avicii and Blacc previously found worldwide fame on their 2013 smash hit “Wake Me Up”.(Read: 10 Songs That Get Real About Mental Health)Check out “SOS” below via a visual comprised of fan memories.TIM is slated for a June 6th release date. The follow-up to 2015’s Stories came together thanks to “nearly finished songs, along with notes, email conversations and text messages about the music” left behind by the late Swedish DJ.“The songwriters that Tim was collaborating with on this album have continued the process to get as close to his vision as possible,” his family noted in a statement. “Since Tim’s passing, the family decided not to keep the music locked away – instead they wanted to share it with his fans all around the world.”Avicii’s body was found on April 20th, 2018 in Muscat, Oman, where he had been on vacation. An autopsy later revealed that the 28-year-old artist had taken his own life.In anticipation of the posthumous LP, find all of Avicii’s past vinyl releases by heading here.",articles40,"['Tim Bergling', 'Avicii’s']"

"Origins is a recurring new music feature that asks artists to take a deep dive into the inspirations behind their most recent track.This past March, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer Sam Cohen successfully lent his extensive talents to Lux Prima, the stellar collaborative album from Brian Burton, aka Danger Mouse and Yeah Yeah Yeahs singer Karen O. It turns out that wasn’t the only record Cohen was diligently working on: He has one of his own on the horizon. Titled The Future’s Still Ringing in My Ears, the LP serves as Cohen’s long-awaited sophomore album following Cool It from 2015.The 11-track solo collection came together sort of by chance with the help of Burton, Cohen’s longtime friend. The two musicians got together in the studio to brainstorm material for another artist, but once those sessions fell through, the focus quickly turned to Cohen. Though known for founding groups Apollo Sunshine and Yellowbirds and producing acts like Kevin Morby and Benjamin Booker, Cohen finally felt inspired to begin writing stuff solely for himself again.“Brian really helped me get motivated to make this record,” Cohen noted in a statement. “His support pushed me to get started, and to value myself as an artist. It came at a time when I needed to hear that from someone.”“I Can’t Lose”, the latest single off The Future’s Still Ringing in My Ears, finds Cohen having rediscovered his worth and drawing on the confidence that such enlightenment brings. On the track, which features a bass-and-drums loop helmed by Fabrizio Moretti of The Strokes, Cohen talks about being lost and broken, but maintains that he “can’t lose anymore.” His voice here is partially mellow, and maybe even exhausted, drained by his experiences. But one also gets the sense that Cohen is still determined not to let life swallow up what’s left of him; even at his lowest, he’s managed to will himself to be defiant.Take a listen below.For more insight into “I Can’t Lose”, Cohen talked to Consequence of Sound about how Danger Mouse, Queen’s Brian May, and fatherhood all had an impact on the making of the track.The mysterious presence of Danger Mouse: The origin of “I Can’t Lose” is really where the whole record kind of began, and that’s rooted in the mysterious way that Brian Burton came into my life. It was a few years ago now, but he reached out, really just out of blue, to say he liked my last record, and we started doing little sessions together. I was out in LA to do one of these. It was early days in our working together, and as soon as I got to town, the session was canceled. He was like, “This is great, we’ve got the studio, you’re here, let’s just work on some of your new stuff.” I had no material, hadn’t written a song in months. I’d just had my first kid and had been producing a few things for other people, but we just got straight to work and right away, there was this really exciting sound happening!Real love and becoming a father:Writing always has to be kind of subconscious for me if it’s going to be any good. Stuff just comes out and what showed up on this one was this complicated relationship between my darker nature and my desire and responsibility to be loving and nurturing for my wife and my kids. It’s been a sort of salvation in that it’s forced me to put my anxiety and occasional despair in a compartment, and pour myself into being and doing what I need to be and do for them. They’ve taught me a lot about love.The Unconscious Brian May:There’s been a definite pattern in my journey as a guitarist of finding a hero, aping them hard for a time, and then letting that influence recede into the musical DNA, where the impulse to emulate them is more natural than imitation; it’s kind of biological. Such is the case with Brian May. I had a deep Queen phase back in music school, and he’s definitely still in the back of my brain, offering nuggets of wisdom like, “save the electric guitar for the moment when a 4 part fuzz harmony is totally appropriate. Starve them out – don’t even strum a chord until it’s time!”Sir Paul’s Electric Harpsichord:I’d be remiss if I didn’t give credit to the harpsichord in Brian’s studio which arrived by way of Nigel Godrich, by way of Paul McCartney. I was like, “Does this thing sound amazing?”, and they said, “Not really, it’s kinda f’d up”, and I said, “Ah, that’s unfortunate since I’m definitely playing it all over this song!”. It does sound amazing.The Future’s Still Ringing in My Ears officially arrives May 17th through Burton’s own 30th Century Records. Cohen will support the new album with a North American spring tour alongside Kevin Morby. Grab your tickets here.Sam Cohen 2019 Tour Dates:

"The Raconteurs are returning in June with their first album in 11 years, Help Us Stranger. As to be expected from the Jack White-led outfit, the lead-up to the new record has been nothing short of eventful. In just the last few days, they staged their live comeback at Third Man Records’ 10th anniversary concert in Nashville; offered up the debut of multiple new songs; and even announced a lengthy North American tour.White & co. are continuing their hot streak today with their cover of “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”. While Donovan’s 1965 original carried its own dose of grit, The Raconteurs breathe pure fire into their rendition.(Read: Jack White in 10 Songs)Take a listen below.The Raconteurs’ cover of “Hey Gyp” will appear on Help Us Stranger, which is due out June 21st.

"Charly Bliss are officially a month out from the release of their sophomore album, Young Enough. Following 2017’s solid Guppy, the LP is being teased today with a third single called “Hard to Believe”.Like March’s “Chatroom”, the Brooklyn-based outfit masks knotty, despairing reflections under layers of seemingly harmless, driving pop punk. On Charly Bliss’ latest effort, singer Eva Hendricks specifically wrestles with herself over whether she should finally let go of an unhealthy relationship.(Read: 20 Essential SXSW Acts to Catch on Tour This Spring)“I can’t accept that you’re leaving/ I can’t pretend that I need it,” Hendricks sings, the push-pull tension clear in just those two concise lines.Accompanying the track is a music video helmed by Henry Kaplan. As Hendricks notes in a press statement, it captures the “inner monologues” of each member as the band performs:“We shot the video on 35mm film over two days with our close friend Henry Kaplan 24 hours after returning from SXSW. Henry did a spectacular job of incorporating each of our personalities into this video, as well as providing a slightly fantastical, but ultimately realistic portrayal of a typical band practice. While we’re running songs, each band-member usually has their own inner-monologue running of either things they’re distracted by, or things they’d rather be doing. This video feels extremely “us” and I don’t think we could have made it with anyone else.”Check it out below.Young Enough arrives May 10th via Barsuk Records, and you can listen to the first single “Capacity” here.

"Yeasayer returned last week with “I’ll Kiss You Tonight”, their first new music release in three years. Now, the psych pop veterans have formally and finally announced the album on which that single is set to appear. The Amen & Goodbye follow-up is titled, Erotic Reruns, and is marked down for a June 7th due date via their own Yeasayer Records.Initial ideas for the LP began brewing toward the end of 2016 and serve as a “vehement” response to the fateful presidential election that closed out the year, per a press statement. Throughout the full-length, Yeasayer weave in “a sardonic and chilling reaction to dark times” alongside “moments of warmth and reflection,” as they ruminate on paranoia, humanity, and technology.(Read: Top 50 Songs of 2007)The new album also sees Yeasayer revisiting their earlier, more DIY days, as all nine songs were recorded in studios in Brooklyn and upstate New York built by the group members themselves — singer/multi-instrumentalist Chris Keating, singer/multi-instrumentalist Anand Wilder, and bassist/singer Ira Wolf Tuton.To coincide with the LP news, the three-piece has broken off not one, but two new songs: “Let Me Listen in on You” and closing track “Fluttering in the Floodlights”.

"Lizzo is less than two weeks out from the release of her new album, Cuz I Love You. In the lead-up to the record, the Minneapolis-based rapper has dropped off singles like “Juice” and her Missy Elliott collaboration, “Tempo”. She’s also turned in a pair of cover songs, such as her gospel reimagining of Miley Cyrus and Mark Ronson’s “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” and today’s take on the Oscar-winning Star is Born cut “Shallow”.Lizzo unfurled her powerful Lady Gaga rendition during a recent session at the SiriusXMU Studios. Accompanied only by an acoustic guitar, she was able to let her vocals fully take centerstage. We’re used to watching Lizzo flaunt her bold, unforgettable personality (and flute skills!), so being able to see the artist rely solely on her voice — and still impress — is a testament to her well-rounded talent.(Read: 20 Essential SXSW Acts to Catch on Tour)Check it out below.Last week, Better Oblivion Community Center (Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers) also covered “Shallow” during a concert in Brooklyn.Cuz I Love You lands in stores April 19th.

"Sinkane is back with a new single called “Dépaysé”, and this time he is ready to look inward at his family history through song. The title track comes from his seventh studio album, Dépaysé, which drops May 31st via City Slang.According to Ahmed Gallab, the artist behind the moniker, the song came to him in a dream. He was walking through Omdurman, Sudan — his native homeland as the child of Sudanese parents, although technically he was born in London and raised in the US — when he overheard his father playing guitar and singing in Arabic. He was sitting across from his childhood home. His father repeated a series of lyrics: “I am your life/And all of our lives/From within the city until our uprising/Our days have left us in the city and, with our imagination, we move forward.” Naturally, Gallab took it as a sign.(Watch: Sinkane’s Live Performance at Chicago’s Lincoln Hall)So it makes sense that “Dépaysé” centers around those words in its own lyrics. The song combines elements of traditional Sudanese folk music with psych rock, long electric guitar solos, and heartfelt harmonies. It’s a beautiful, enchanting listen that sits comfortably behind “Everybody”, the previous single from Dépaysé. The song also comes with a trippy visual by Mad Alchemy Liquid Show. Check it out below.“‘Dépaysé’ is a French word that basically means ‘to be removed from one’s habitual surroundings’,” Gallab said in a press release. “By extension, it means to be disoriented, homeless. That’s a feeling I relate to very much in these times — and I don’t think I’m the only one who feels this way. That word gave me clarity and made my journey of self discovery that much more exciting.”Sinkane recently announced a string of tour dates that will bring him across the US and Europe throughout the month of June. Get tickets to the shows here. You can also buy past Sinkane releases on vinyl here.",articles40,['“‘Dépaysé’']
"Faye Webster is prepping her third album, Atlanta Millionaires Club, for release next month. The indie songwriter, who is heavily influenced by the city’s rich hip-hop history, takes an intimate approach to her music.“Everything is way personal. I’ve never been that kind of person who can read a book and then write a song about the book,” Webster remarked in a press statement. “I have to write about very personal things for me to even want to write”.Following early offerings “Room Temperature” and “Kingston” comes today’s “Flowers”, which sees Webster channeling her love of Aaliyah and all things soulful, pulsing R&B. The track is a collaboration with Father, the Atlanta-bred, LA-based rapper who gained prominence following his iLoveMakonnen-assisted “Look at Wrist” single.Listen to “Flowers” below.Atlanta Millionaires Club arrives on May 24th through Secretly Canadian. Webster is currently supporting the full-length on a spring tour alongside Stella Donnelly and Lord Huron.

"If anyone knows the power of a good music video, it’s the person who released an entire album’s worth of absurd videos.Fresh off the release of her debut visual album, Whack World, Tierra Whack has spent the past few weeks releasing a string of new standalone singles. This treasure trove of new music began with the release of “Only Child” in February and was soon followed by “Clones”, “Gloria”, “Wasteland”, and “Unemployed”. Now, the creative rapper has shared a music video for the latter single, which sees her hitting as many lines as she can in under three minutes.In the song’s music video, directed by Cat Solen, Whack slices her way through a towering pile of potatoes. With each karate chop and powerful squish, the potatoes come to life with cartoon eyes and weak smiles, fearful of their new fate. Come the end of the song, you learn she’s been cooking a dozen bowls of mashed potatoes, hash browns, and fries for a giant spud overlord of sorts. It’s an animation style reminiscent of the darker side of Pee-wee’s Big Adventure. Check it out below.The zany absurdities of Tierra Whack’s visuals recently came to life in real time. Last month, the Philly rapper performed “Only Child” on Kimmel, complete with a vintage stroller and wide-eyed baby monster.This summer, Whack is set to perform at some of the biggest music festivals in the world. You can see her at Primavera Sound, Coachella, Made In America, Afropunk Brooklyn, Osheaga, Outside Lands, Lollapalooza, Soundset, Electric Forest, and Red Bull Music Festival New York — which will be one of Red Bull’s final events before shuttering this October.",articles40,"['Tierra Whack’s', 'Red Bull’s']"

"Brooklyn-via-Boston psych pop outfit Crumb have announced their debut album, Jinx. The self-released follow-up to their sophomore EP, 2017’s Locket, is due out June 14th.Previously released single “Part III” appears on the 10-track effort, as does the newly revealed “Nina”. The track is a cooly hypnotic introduction to Crumb’s practiced mix of psych and jazz, mesmerizing guitar strains reverberating over smoky blue piano notes and a steady rhythmic backbone. However smooth it is, there’s something dangerous about the blend, the hint of a specter stalking between the hazy tones.The stalker is clear in the song’s accompanying video, and his name is David Patrick Kelly. The Twin Peaks and The Warriors actor stars in the Haoyan of America-directed clip, in which Kelly is a hunter with one target in his sights: Crumb frontwoman Lila Ramani.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature that tasks artists to look into the inspirations behind their most recent track.Familiarity breeds comfort, but comfort can breed sufferance. When you’ve been used to something for so long, it becomes ever more challenging to break away from it, even if we acknowledge how detrimental it is. On her new track “Circles”, WILDES captures that spiraling self-defeat in a way that gives hope and, against all odds, comfort.The latest track from the project of London’s Ella Walker is a swirling expanse of echoing vocals and reverberating guitars. Layers build atop each other over the song’s four-and-a-half-minute run time, a determined rhythm beating its way through the airy cacophony like an act of defiance. It’s a structure that reflects WILDES’ lyrical resilience as she sings from the perspective of a heartbroken lover trapped in the potential of a failed relationship, but finally ready to do what needs to be done: “Gentle silence/ Waiting for the moment to break it/ I’ve been slipping/ But I think that I’m gonna make it.”“Circles” continues the build up to the fall release of WILDES’ anticipated debut full-length. A press statement describes the effort as “partly worts-and-all, but it’s also a celebration of our innate condition.” Such is the dichotomy of “Circles”, as you can hear for yourself below.For more on the human conditions and musical influences that went into “Circles”, WILDES has shared the Origins of the track.Relationship Breakdown:The main influence for this song was a person — one my close friends whose relationship broke down. “Circles” is about the time and love he lost during that breakdown, and it was almost like therapy writing it, taking time to contemplate the good and the bad from that time. We turned something devastating into a fresh start, and a reason to move on.Psych and Soul:I was listening to a lot of old American psych and soul at the time of writing “Circles”. It had quite a big impact on me, so I really wanted to thread all of those sounds throughout the production of “Circles” and more generally throughout my music going forward.Ireland:During the writing process I went to Ireland to visit my family and have a much needed break from it all. Driving through the Wicklow Mountains and past the vast lakes and hills is always a special, almost religious moment. It gives me real perspective, and this time it really made me want to create a soundscape that was bigger, more epic and more beautiful.Big Thief — Masterpiece:I was also listening to Big Thief’s debut album Masterpiece on repeat (I know — very late to the party). I’m always so struck by Adrianne Lenker’s haunting but fierce vocal, and her masterful storytelling became something I wanted to learn from. I loved the way her delicate vocals swelled and resounded with those heavy rock guitars. I wanted to take a step up with my writing and listening to this album really helped and encouraged me to do that.",articles40,"['WILDES', 'Layers', 'WILDES’', 'WILDES’', 'WILDES', 'Thief’s', 'I’m', 'Adrianne Lenker’s']"
"Katherine Paul loaded her debut album as Black Belt Eagle Scout, last year’s Mother of My Children, with stirring songs that addressed her singular life experiences. With a grunge indebted bent, she ushered listeners into her world as a queer feminist member of the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community. Now, in the video for her new single “Loss & Relax”, she literally brings us with her as she returns to the very home that shaped her.The track itself is a soft and ruminative number that finds a wistful BBES reminding herself of where she came from. She recalls “the place where ferries go” and “the place that was our home” over meditative guitar plucking before tearing off a heavy, spacey breakdown at the end.In the accompanying clip, Paul and director Angel Two Bulls actually take viewers to those locations, with shots filmed all around the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community and Swinomish Indian Nation lands in Washington state. One scene even finds her ripping on a St. Vincent Signature Ernie Ball Music Man guitar as she looks out onto the waters of the Salish Sea from the back of her pickup.Take a look below.“Loss & Relax” serves as the A-side to a 7-inch single b/w “Half Colored Hair”, due out April 26th via Saddle Creek. Speaking of the new song in a press release, Paul said,“As I was writing the guitar line, I kept seeing the water of the Salish Sea and the local ferries drifting people in and out of place. Ferries are such a beautiful part of my childhood and served as a major form of transportation. Thinking about my home and how canoes have turned into ferries is a sad, but also beautiful thought. Nowadays with Canoe Journeys, canoes are alongside ferries, roaming our waters to lands, sharing customs and culture. That is what I think about now when I listen to the fully recorded version of the song. I see a strong and fierce community of my people continuing to thrive in whatever comes our way. That is how I feel about myself, a survivor and thriver of this land, a water protector, a womxn, the future.”You can pre-order the 7-inch now.

"King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard have opened the floodgates of new music. Since announcing their new album Fishing for Fishies, the Australian psych-rock titans have released a handful of new songs: the title track, “Cyboogie”, “Boogieman Sam”, and now, “Planet B”.New single “Planet B” sees the band channeling their inner John Dwyer. Chugging riffs, manic lyrics, and squealing guitars give the song a heavier feel than the group’s usual psych-rock tendencies, but it still feels at home along the other singles released so far. If each of their songs had a genre, this one would fall under the metal category, for sure.(Read: King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard announce 2019 North American tour)The song’s accompanying music video looks like a prison break on a bad acid trip. The comically large band appears on a desolate highway, each member sporting neon orange clothes and high socks beneath open-toed sandals. They go through a series of workout-like moves (jumping, running, and huddling in a circle) while laughing creepily throughout. Eventually, a guy shows up and shoots them all dead. Watch the music video below.As Stereogum points out, “Planet B” does not appear on the original tracklist for Fishing for Fishies. Could it be a cool song they cut from the album last minute? Is it a track off an upcoming but as-yet-unannounced album? Is it a secret bonus track off Fishing for Fishies that they couldn’t help but release? Only time will tell.King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard recently announced a North American tour that extends from summer into the fall.

"Just like that, Steve Lacy is back with new music. The Internet member released a new single called “N Side”, and longtime fans will be pleased to know it’s worth the wait.“N Side” picks up right where Lacy’s most recent solo release, Steve Lacy’s Demo, left off in 2017. A slow, automated drum part carries the R&B beat forward with padded bass echoing behind it. Lacy turns up the reverb and lets his laid back singing float over it all, bringing some gentle strumming of electric guitar into the mix.The song comes with a “karaoke version” video. Learn the lyrics and try to sing along to Lacy’s soulful falsettos by watching the video below.The release of “N Side” also means there is a good chance Lacy has a new album on the way. Fans will recall that The Internet recently teased new music, tweeting, “2 solo albums finished .” The band’s most recent album was last year’s excellent Hive Mind.Solo work aside, Lacy has been on a creative high as of late. Over the past few years, he contributed to new albums from Solange, Tyler, the Creator, Kali Uchis, and more. It seems he can’t do wrong.",articles40,"['Steve Lacy', 'The Internet', 'Internet']"
"Falling In Reverse have released a new track called “DRUGS” featuring Slipknot and Stone Sour frontman Corey Taylor, along with a disturbingly violent video to accompany the song.“DRUGS” is Falling In Reverse’s latest single, and marks the third in a trilogy of one-off singles released from the band, the others being “Losing My Life” and “Losing My Mind”. The group released their last album, Coming Home, back in 2017.Taylor also appears in the video for “DRUGS”, popping up at the 3-minute mark to deliver the intense breakdown. Be warned, as there’s violent imagery throughout, including a chainsaw-wielding Falling in Reverse singer Ronnie Radke causing bloody carnage.In other news, Falling in Reverse will set off on a U.S. headlining tour later this month with support from Ice Nine Kills, From Ashes to New, and New Years Day.

"Cage the Elephant are just under two weeks away from dropping their new album, Social Cues. We’ve already heard the lead single “Ready to Let Go”, gotten the Origins of “House of Glass”, and jammed to the Beck-assisted “Night Running”. Now, the Kentucky rockers have shared a slower sample of the Tell Me I’m Pretty follow-up in “Goodbye”.Melancholy piano notes are accentuated by strings both gently bowed and quickly plucked. A low-humming bass keeps a steady rumble throughout the ballad, a heavy counterbalance to the previous singles’ chaotic edges. Though the song clearly stands out sonically from what we’ve heard of Social Cues thus far, its filled with the same sort of dread (“I wanna scream, I wanna laugh, I wanna close my eyes/ I wanna hide somewhere that’s hard to find”) that’s creeped through each new track.Take a listen below.Social Cues is due out April 19th. Ahead of the release, stock up on past Cage albums on vinyl here. The band will support their latest full-length on a highly anticipated co-headlining tour with Beck featuring support from Spoon.

"Morrissey has a new covers album on the way titled California Son. The 12-track collection has been teased thus far with Moz’s rendition of Roy Orbison’s “It’s Over” and his take on Jobriath’s “Morning Starship”, which featured an assist from Ed Droste of Grizzly Bear. For the third preview, The Smiths frontman has tried his hand at “Wedding Bell Blues”, first made famous by The 5th Dimension back in 1969.Joining Morrissey on the cover is Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong, and together they turn in a faithful rendering of the original, complete with bells and piano accompaniment. Morrissey, however, does provide a bit of a present-day update via his impassioned vocal performance. “Morrissey’s legendary baritone takes center stage,” reads a press statement, “injecting the classic ode to frustrated love with a modern, polished euphoria that subtly nods at queer desire.”(Read: Ranking: Every Song by The Smiths from Worst to Best)Take a listen below.California Son, which also includes covers of Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and Carly Simon, officially arrives May 24th.To support the new LP, Moz has lined up his first Canadian tour in over 15 years, as well as a seven-date Broadway residency.

"PJ Harvey recently provided music for director Ivo Van Hove’s new stage adaptation of the 1950 Oscar-winning classic All About Eve. With the play now entering the midpoint of its limited run at London’s Noël Coward Theatre, two tracks from Harvey’s score have today been shared online.The first track is called “The Moth” and features a vocal performance from All About Ever star Lily James. James’ voice coos through the thick gothic air of Harvey’s composition, a song that actually feels constrained for the Hope Six Demolition Project singer-songwriter yet still retains her particular art-rock style. The instrumental “Descending”, meanwhile, utilizes falling synth notes and a drum section that builds a surprising groove to create a hypnotic soundscape.Check out both songs below.Speaking of the score in a statement, PJ Harvey said,“I have always loved stories, and so to compose music to support and enhance a story being told is a challenge I enjoy. I also love the freedom that working instrumentally can give me without the constraints of song form.For All About Eve I chose to work with my long-time collaborator James Johnston as he has a soulfulness and sensitivity to his playing that inspires me. I also worked with Kenrick Rowe who has a versatility to his drumming I knew I could experiment with until I found what was right.”The All About Eve soundtrack is due out April 12th via Lakeshore/Invada; pre-orders are going on now. The play’s other star, Gillian Anderson, also has a vocal performance on a track called “The Sandman”.

"The Shrine are back with a new bassist and an upcoming EP titled Cruel World, and they’ve teamed up with Heavy Consequence for the exclusive premiere of the track “Dance on a Razor’s Edge” (listen below).The Los Angeles outfit combines elements of hard rock, punk, metal, psychedelic, garage rock and more for a powerful sound that’s both heavy and catchy, as heard on “Dance on a Razor’s Edge”. The track is one of four songs on the Cruel World EP, which arrives May 3rd via Eliminator Records.The band has welcomed onetime Nashville Pussy bassist Corey Parks into the group, which is rounded out by frontman Josh Landau and drummer Jeffrey Murray. “We had jammed with Corey before on a Motörhead cover, and she actually took me to hang out with Lemmy in the studio during their final album,” Landau says. “There isn’t anyone else we could imagine doing The Shrine with other than Corey now. She brings a touch of class, charisma, and fire to the stage that pushes our chemistry into a whole new epic realm.”The Shrine have already had some high profile gigs, performing on Norman Reedus’ AMC show Ride, and headlining artist Shepard Fairey’s “Damaged” art show in Los Angeles.

"It was just this past November that Jeff Tweedy released his inaugural collection of original solo material, WARM, an album which proved to be among our favorites of the year. Now, less than six months later, we’re already being gifted with its follow-up. The Wilco frontman has announced WARMER, a companion record due out this Saturday, April 13th, for Record Store Day.WARMER comes from the same sessions as WARM, recorded at Wilco’s The Loft studio in Chicago. “At some point I separated the songs from the WARM/WARMER session into two records with individual character, but still tried to keep the overall tone and texture of the combined session consistent,” Tweedy explains in a statement. “In a lot of ways these two records could have been released as a double LP. WARMER means as much to me as WARM and might just as easily have been released as the first record of the pair.”(Read: 10 Years and 10 Questions with Jeff Tweedy)Lead single “Family Ghost” finds Tweedy confronting the sort of casual, systemic racism he witnessed growing up in southern Illinois. “When the lights go out, there’s no applause/ Condescending to the hideous though,” he sings on the ruminative strummer. “Imprisoned in my lonely skin/ I feel so American.” Hear the song via its music video, which distorts footage of familiar red-capped crowds until they’re a wash of indistinguishable colors, below.The initial RSD vinyl version of WARMER will be limited to just 5,000 pressings worldwide.

"During an appearance on The Tonight Show last month, ScHoolboy Q previewed a new Travis Scott collaboration called “CHopstick”. Now, the studio version of the track has been released in full.As Pitchfork points out, ScHoolboy Q’s Black Hippy collaborator, Kendrick Lamar, is listed in the song’s credits as a composer and lyricist.Update — Wednesday, April 10th: The new music video for “CHopstix” has been revealed. Directed by Nabil (Frank Ocean, Kanye West), the black-and-white clip follows Q, dressed in formal attire, as he dances onstage with a troupe of ballerinas. Scott, meanwhile, acts as conductor for a group of string players.ScHoolboy Q originally intended to drop “CHopstick” last week, but delayed its release in light of Nipsey Hussle’s tragic death. He told fans in an Instagram Story, “Nobody should be putting nothing out this week. I’m not putting out music tomorrow — it’s not cool.”CHopstick” comes on the heels of Q’s “Numb Numb Juice”, which was released last month.

During an appearance on Australia’s Triple J radio over the weekend, the indie rocker revealed the single’s A-side, “Everybody Here Hates You”.(Read: Top 10 Albums from Mom + Pop Music)Full of a chugging melancholy, Barnett described the song as about “some sort of social anxiety that then morphs into paranoia and a level of sadness and depression.” Admitting that she took inspiration for the track title from Jeff Buckley (see: “Everybody Here Wants You”), she added,“Like when you think a haircut will help you, or a clean meal will cleanse you, ya know, as if all these things will make you feel better, but really nothing is gonna to fix you. So you kind of have to tell everyone that it’s all okay so they don’t worry. But it’s also tongue in cheek.

"Norwegian synthpop artist AURORA is prepping her third album for release on June 7th via Glassnote Records. Dubbed A Different Kind of Human (Step II), it serves as the complementary installment to last year’s surprise record,  Infections of A Different Kind (Step I).Though still part of the Different Kind series, Step II finds AURORA traversing more experimental territory. The location where the LP was recorded helped to inform this new, unconventional sound; the artist set up shop “in a more lo-fi space than before,” one described as a French chateau that’s “beautiful and dreamy” and “far away.”(Read: Iceland Airwaves 2018 Photo Gallery: Blood Orange, Natalie Prass, AURORA)Much of Step II is said to focus on the ecological crisis plaguing society. We hear this on the album’s latest single, “The Seed”, in which AURORA reflects on the toxic ways we treat nature and those around us.“People say ‘live like you don’t care’ or ‘party like you don’t care’, but I like to care,” AURORA remarked. “I think people do, too, now more than ever, for example when Trump was elected people became more involved politically because they were frustrated. It’s a time of open ears and open eyes”.Check it out below.A Different Kind of Human (Step II) Tracklist:

"Boy, do Yeasayer like to keep fans waiting. They took four years between their last two records — 2012’s Fragrant World and 2016’s Amen & Goodbye, and we’ve barely heard a peep from the group since. Now, finally, they’re back with their first new music in three years, “I’ll Kiss You Tonight”.The track serves as a teaser of their forthcoming new studio album, which is expected sometime in June. Until then, we’ll have to be satiated by “I’ll Kiss You Tonight”, a darkly thumping track with a playful piano breakdown on the bridge. “I’ll be okay/ This must be our fate/ You and I can do this everyday/ Even though I hate you, I’ll kiss you tonight,” goes the hook about a complicated relationship that’s more hate-love than love-hate.(Read: Top 50 Songs of 2007)“I’ll Kiss You Tonight” comes via a video directed and animated by Theodore Sefcik. Brightly colored characters seem to stumble over and into each other, a weird trick of digital physics generation. Check it out below.Expect more info on Yeasayer’s new album and 2019 plans soon.

"Tash Sultana’s ability to blend reggae grooves with a uniquely alt-psych vibe is what made them one of last year’s breakout artists. It won them spots on both our Top Songs and Top Albums of the years lists as well as an Artist of the Month designation, after all. But the Australian musician can also handle a barefooted acoustic jam just as well, as Sultana proves on their new single, “Can’t Buy Happiness”.We heard hints of this on Flow State tracks like “Harvest Love” and “Pink Moon”, but “Can’t Buy Happiness” operates on a different level. At first, it floats on like a ’90s folk-R&B track, only to find itself elevated by the approach of bracing strings and the sudden explosion into the atmosphere that occurs over the final third.(Read: Top 10 Albums from Mom + Pop Music)As Sultana explained in a press release,“Here’s a little piece quite unlike the others. See I used to write music like this all the time, but I feel like it wasn’t the right moment to release it. My head’s in a different place and my ears are as well. I guess this is what happens when you’re feeling good within”.The track comes with an accompanying video from director Dara Munnis, who’s also served as Sultana’s longtime tour photographer and videographer. The clip recreates the the time Munnis first heard Sultana perform “Can’t Buy Happiness” in a dressing room shower inside Vancouver’s Thunderbird Arena — with one explosive difference. Check it out below.Sultana has a number of tour dates on the horizon, including a May North American trek and stops at festivals like Atlanta’s Shaky Knees, BottleRock Napa Valley, and Spain’s Mad Cool.

"Three years after dropping their debut LP, Blue Wave, Operators are back. The trio of Dan Boeckner, Devojka, and Sam Brown (Divine Fits, New Bomb Turks) have announced the impending release of their sophomore album, Radiant Dawn, and teased the effort with the first single.Radiant Dawn is due out sometime in May, ahead of their recently announce tour.

"Canadian punks PUP are back today with their new album, Morbid Stuff. The band’s third full-length overall can be streamed in full below via Apple Music and Spotify.Recorded with producer/mixer Dave Schiffman (Weezer, The Mars Volta), the new album serves as the follow-up to 2016’s The Dream Is Over. While there’s still plenty of “fury and celebration” in the tunes, it’s now more “rooted in understanding of where that fury comes from,” as a press release puts it. A lot of that stems from an exploration of lead singer Stefan Babcock’s battles with depression, as was heard on lead single “Kids” and “Free at Last”, which features Charly Bliss’ Eva Hendricks.Speaking to Noisey about the new record and it’s focus on mental health, Babcock said,“We’re all pretty nihilistic, pessimistic, fatalistic — whatever you want to call it. But there’s this whole element to this band and this record about taking all that negativity and trying to do what you can to make it fun, or to poke fun at your own situation. Just find some glimmer of light in the darkness.”Take a listen to all the Morbid Stuff below.

"Don’t let their sophomore album fool you: Sego most certainly do not suck. Would we have really named them our April Artist of the Month if they did?

You can stream the whole thing now below via Spotify and Apple Music.The follow-up to 2016’s Once Was Lost Now Just Hanging Around sees the band recording as a four-piece for the first time. Founding members Spencer Petersen (vocals, guitar) and Tom Carroll (drums) were joined by guitarist/keyboardist Brandon McBride for sessions in Canada, while bassist Alyssa Davey joined in on later sessions in Los Angeles. Producer Dave Newfeld accompanied the group for a winter month in a Canadian church, helping the band embrace the imperfections of their bass-fronted sound.(Buy: Tickets to Sego’s 2019 Tour)In his review of Sego Sucks, Consequence of Sound writer Parker Reed said,“An irritating trend of music reviewing is when the term “mature” is equated solely to somber sounds and down-tempo choices. This type of mentality would completely discredit a group like Sego’s evident ability to construct an effectively aggressive track with smart decisions made at every turn. The ‘ah-ya-yas’ of ‘Heart Attack’ and swirling grooves of ‘Shame’ come across as engaging decisions from a group that clearly doesn’t want to bloat their material. The self-awareness present not only in the album’s title but also its production choices and lyrical material proves that Sego know exactly what they’re accomplishing.”Take a listen below.Sego Sucks Artwork:Sego Sucks Tracklist:

"Track by Track is a new music feature in which we offer an artist the chance to dig deep into each track on their latest record, one at a time.Brooklyn indie songwriter Aly Spaltro, better known as Lady Lamb, has released her new album, Even in the Tremor. It’s available to stream in full below via Apple Music or Spotify.Due out via Ba Da Bing Records, the 11-track effort serves as her third overall following 2015’s After. The LP, however, marks Spaltro’s first employing the talents of an outside co-producer.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)After meeting with a number of industry veterans who told her that “her arrangements needed rewriting,” Spaltro eventually moved forward with a less established producer in Erin Tonkon (Tony Visconti, David Bowie’s Blackstar).Recording sessions took place at Brooklyn’s Figure 8 Studios, with Spaltro recruiting frequent collaborator bassist/pianist Benjamin Lazar Davis (Cuddle Magic, Kimbra, Okkervil River) and drummer Jeremy Gustin (David Byrne, Albert Hammond Jr.).In support of Even in the Tremor, Spaltro will kick off her 34-date “Deep Love Tour” across North America next week. Grab your tickets here.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>For more on the album, which she considers her most intimate and honest to date, Spaltro broke it down Track by Track — from the title track to early single and one of our favorite songs of the week, “Deep Love”.“Little Flaws”:“Little Flaws” was inspired by being in love and the point in a relationship when you realize neither one of you is perfect – you’re actually a little obnoxious – but you have the same goal of accepting one another.“Deep Love”:“Deep Love” poured out of me one afternoon when I was feeling lost and nihilistic. I walked by my neighbors sharing a sweet moment with their animals and went right home and picked up my guitar to try to tap into my own gratitude.“Even in the Tremor”:“Even in the Tremor” is the push and pull between obsessing over the past and stressing about the future while having the awareness that the power to choose to be present is in your own hands. It’s a self sabotage: the past will kill the present – if I let it.“Untitled Soul”:“Untitled Soul” was built around a dream I had where my mom was holding me as a baby and handed her to me to help stop her crying. The song around it is a longing to be understood.“Strange Maneuvers”:“Strange Maneuvers” came out of a time when I was walking around the city all day and thinking a lot about mistakes I felt I’d made. It took my friend Kurt to distract me from that negative thinking on a phone call to get me to change perspective and that simple gesture inspired the seeds of the lyrics.“Without a Name”:“Without A Name” was written when I was about 19 and reimagined and retitled for this record. My band and I jammed on it past the written version in the studio and decided to keep that take as the instrumental outro.“Young Disciple”:“Young Disciple” is a song I’ve been wanting to write for probably a decade. It may answer the question for why so many religious references make it into my songs – stemming from my parents going through a born-again phase when I was five and first telling me about death in a fast food spot.“Prayer of Love”:“Prayer of Love” was written while I was recording Tender Warriors Club EP in Sweden. I recorded it solo and decided to sit on the song for ‘Even in the Tremor’ so I could reimagine it with a full band.“July Was Mundane”:“July Was Mundane” is about some different relationships I’ve made mistakes in and trying to take accountability while forgiving myself for them. It reflects on the challenge it is to make the choice to pull oneself out of self-loathing and regret.“Oh My Violence”:“Oh My Violence” is a part II to “July was Mundane” in a sense because it’s a continuation of the themes of self-sabotage and the difficulties of staying present. The lyrics were inspired by my time traveling the US alone and observing people’s lives and reflecting on my own.“Emily”:“Emily” is a special song because it was written by accident in the studio while recording ‘Even in the Tremor.’ I had these lyrics I was bummed I couldn’t fit in, and my bass player Benjamin Lazar Davis had this riff. On 10-minute breaks we’d sneak away to put the two together and were able to record the song on our last night in the studio.",articles40,"['Track', 'Lady Lamb', 'David Bowie', 'Cuddle Magic', 'Kimbra', 'Okkervil River', 'David Byrne', 'Spaltro', 'hidden;line', 'Track', 'Track', '“Strange Maneuvers”:“Strange Maneuvers', 'Disciple”:“Young Disciple', 'II']"

"When Marina announced her newest album, LOVE + FEAR, would be “two eight-track collections that form a set”, most listeners didn’t interpret that as literally two different collections.

Love scared me so much. ( Um… remember “Electra Heart”?!). This record is a result of working through that,” she added in a series of tweets. “A lot of us think of love as positive and fear as negative but the truth is there are positives found within fear and negatives found in love.”LOVE+FEAR is Marina’s first album since FROOT, which was released in 2015.

"If the thought of Marissa Nadler and Stephen Brodsky collaborating on new music together fills your head with brooding folk and ominous guitar chords, you may be peeking into the future. Bonus points if you guessed they would cover a Guns N’ Roses song.On paper, Nadler and Brodsky seem like an obvious pairing. While the gothic folk singer-songwriter doesn’t make the same music as the Cave In and Old Man Bloom member, they both create a shadowy texture to their work and both hail from Massachusetts. After crossing paths in Boston, they teamed up to record a collaborative album. The result of that, dubbed Droneflower, will be out April 26th via Sacred Bones Records.(Read: The Art of Being a Homebody: An Interview with Marissa Nadler)Nadler and Brodsky share their second single off the album, “Estranged”, which happens to be a Guns n’ Roses cover. It isn’t obvious on the first listen, though. The duo turn the original song — a boisterous power ballad with screeching guitar, off the 1991 album Use Your Illusion II — into a slow, harmonious, moody reflection on love. It turns the pent-up energy of the original into something far more introverted and stirring. Listen to their rendition below.“Estranged” comes after the release of “For the Sun”, the lead single off of Droneflower. Pre-orders for the album can be made via Sacred Bones and Bandcamp.Nadler and Brodsky also announced two more live performances in support of the album, with stops in New Haven, Connecticut and Portland, Maine.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature that gives artists the task of exploring the inspirations behind their latest single.It’s true Lauren Ruth Ward used to be a hairdresser, but don’t expect stories of the salon on her new single “Hungry Barber”. The track is the product of her and longtime collaborator/co-producer Eduardo Rivera stepping into the studio with the goal of not writing a song that fit into their usual retro folk stylings. That meant eschewing the expected three-minutes-with-a-chorus structure, and replacing typical percussion with the tapping and flipping of pages in the Well, Hell musician’s own songwriting journal.“Ed and I wanted to see what it would sound like to create in-house and not think, ‘What genre are we?’ or ‘What will the label think?’,” Ward explains in a press release.The result clocks in at exactly a minute-and-a-half of woozy, pleasantly buzzed guitar strums. Those page flips are playfully evident as the track builds like the sexual tension of a midnight meet-up. “We’re the 2:00 a.m. club, drunk and horny/ Will your magic mouth be speaking?/ You make the next day harder,” sings Ward in a stream of conscience she describes as “the inner dialogue when chasing the night’.”Take a listen below. You can also catch Ward on tour later this spring, first with LP and then headlining her own run of shows. Get tickets here.It wasn’t just a desire to buck traditional songwriting trends that led Ward to “Hungry Barber”.

I love the dry production George Martin helped curate. The dry, acoustic guitar on this track paired with Paul’s story telling, takes my imagination into an old Western play.Vali Myers:My favorite artist/muse. I’ve spent nights digging online to find more about this otherworldly, Australia bohemian. I’ve also spent time studying and recreating her self-tattooed face for multiple Halloweens. I’m particularly enamored by the thin mustache-like lines around her mouth and her slight overbite. Though “Hungry Barber” is not written about Vali, the “magic mouth” line is something I’ve had in my notebook for a while and was conjured up due to my infatuation.“Fools” — The Dodos:I love the Dodos. I love Meric’s lyrics and guitar playing. I’ve referenced Logans drumming to every drummer I’ve played with. Since I’ve started co-producing our music, I’ve tried out multiple ideas I’ve gotten from listening to the Dodos. One example: layering vocals, using an effect on some of the layers. “Fools” is a great example of that.",articles40,"['Those', 'Paul’s']"
"Hot Chip have announced their seventh studio full-length, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Out June 21st via Domino, the record follows 2015’s Why Make Sense?.The new album marks the first time the London electronic outfit has worked with outside producers, in an effort to tap into more adventurous songwriting while pushing their trademark synth sounds forward. To that end, they teamed with French producer Philippe Zdar (Phoenix, Cassius) and Rodaidh McDonald (The XX, David Byrne) of Scotland for recording sessions in Paris and London.As a first listen to the nine-track LP, the band has shared the pulsing lead single, “Hungry Child”. A bumping house beat with melancholy lyrics, the track comes paired with a wonderfully conceptualized music video directed by Saman Kesh. The clip stars as Martin Starr and Milana Vayntrub as a quarreling couple who suddenly start hearing “Hungry Child” playing out of no where. It seems to follow them around wherever they go as they desperately try to find a way to shut it off. Though they hate to admit it, the answer may be right in the song’s lyrics.Check out the visuals below.Pre-orders for A Bath Full of Ecstasy are going on now. In addition to standard vinyl, CD, and digital formats, fans can get a signed deluxe double-LP printed on transparent orange and turquoise vinyl housed in a black and white sleeve.

"After being gone for so long, Vampire Weekend have been extra kind to fans in the run-up to their new album, Father of the Bride. They’ve been sharing samples of the Modern Vampires of the City follow-up in pairs, first with “Harmony Hall” and “2021”, and then “Sunflower” and “Big Blue”. Now they’re back with another two tracks, “This Life” and “Unbearably White”.“This Life” features backing vocals from HAIM’s Danielle Haim with production from frontman Ezra Koenig, Ariel Rechtshaid, and Dave Macklovitch. On the track, Koenig interpolates iLoveMakonnen’s song “Tonight”, as he sings, “You’ve been cheatin’ on, cheatin’ on me/I’ve been cheatin’ on, cheatin’ on you.” (Koenig previously appeared on a remix of iLoveMakonnen’s “Down 4 So Long”.)Meanwhile, “Unbearably White” was written by Koenig and produced by Rechtshaid and Koenig with additional production by BloodPop.With the two new songs, we’ve now heard a full third of Father of the Bride ahead of its May 3rd release date. Take a listen to both tracks below.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)Vampire Weekend are set to support the new LP with an full North American tour.

"The National will release their new album, I Am Easy to Find, on May 17th via 4AD. The record promises to be “unlike anything” in the band’s catalog while remaining “totally in line with how they’ve created for much of their careers.” Lead single “You Had Your Soul with You” demonstrated this with its rich, skittering compositions and female-led bridge. Now, we’ve been gifted another sample of the LP with “Light Years”.The new track certainly aligns with some of the more beautifully somber moments of The National’s past efforts, though again the featured female vocalist adds a new texture to the proceedings. “Light Years” works almost entirely off a reiterating piano line as Matt Berninger and his supporting singer coo, “Oh, the glory of it all was lost on me/ Till I saw how hard it’d be to reach you/ And I would always be light years/ Light years away from you.”Check out the track via its video below, which features footage from the album’s corresponding film, I Am Easy to Find from director Mike Mills (20th Century Women) and starring Alicia Vikander.Pre-orders for the Sleep Well Beast follow-up are ongoing; you can pick up more National vinyl here.In addition to the new track, The National have revealed a few more details regarding their upcoming “An Evening with The National” tour dates. The intimate gigs in Paris, London, New York, Toronto, and Los Angeles will begin with a screening of Mills’ film, followed by a Q&A with the band, the director, and others. Afterwards, The National will take the stage for an intimate performance with guests including Kate Stables of This Is the Kit, Mina Tindle, Yuki Numata Resnick, and James McAlister, as well as Gail Ann Dorsey in Paris and Brooklyn Youth Chorus in NYC.After those shows, they’ll head out on a full tour with support coming from Courtney Barnett and Alvvays.

"Australian alt-rocker Alex Lahey is set to release her sophomore album, The Best of Luck Club, on May 17th via Dead Oceans. After previewing the I Love You Like a Brother follow-up with February’s “Don’t Be so Hard on Yourself” — which landed on our New Sounds playlist — she’s now delivered the LP’s second single, “Am I Doing It Right?”.The track’s chugging bass gives way to a rush of guitar and thundering drums on a chorus that highlight’s Lahey’s knack for tucking relatable anxieties in massive hooks. Even if you’re not facing the double-edged sword of growing popularity (“You may think I’ve got nothing lose/ But am I doing it right when I make everyone move?”), you can connect with the pressure of trying to succeed in your own right under the judgmental gaze of everyone else.As Lahey explained in a press release,“Being a musician is considered a weird job without any explanation necessary, but one of the strangest parts about being a musician is that there is absolutely no set pathway you’re supposed to follow to get where you want to go. This song reflects on being thrust into a lifestyle and going with it while feeling like others are looking over your shoulder to make sure you’re doing all the right things by you and everyone else. It’s like fighting a losing battle while loving every minute of it.”Take a listen below.In support of The Best of Luck Club, Lahey has announced a summer North American tour.

"Most recently we heard JPEGMAFIA call out fake rappers on his song “Puff Daddy”. The Baltimore-born artist is back today with “The Who”, in which he turns the focus on himself and his rising profile.Self-produced and featuring added vocals from Eyas, the woozy, stream-of-consciousness cut features verses about JPEGMAFIA’s “million in profits” and how easy it is for him to churn out top-selling songs. “Write a hit while taking a deuce”, he raps — and yes, that’s really the line. Elsewhere, he states that “ima sell out like The Who.” I don’t think he’s quite on the English rock legends’ level just yet, but it’s nice to see the dream is there.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Hip-Hop Albums of 2019)Hear it for yourself below.“The Who” came from the same sessions that birthed JPEGMAFIA’s last proper album, 2018’s Veteran.

"Holy Ghost! have announced their first album in nearly six years. Dubbed Work, it’s out on shelves June 21st through new label home West End Records.Work marks the New York-based outfit’s third full-length overall following 2013’s Dynamics and 2011’s self-titled record, both of which came through James Murphy’s DFA Records. According to a press statement, the new LP sees Holy Ghost! employing a much smaller range of equipment (just a Yamaha CS80 and Mini Moog) due to studio space limitations; however, it may have actually been a blessing in disguise.“Not necessarily the bare necessities, but what would make for the most interesting limited palette,” the band Nick Millhiser commented in a statement. “David Bowie didn’t have every f*cking synthesizer on earth to make Low. He had two. And that’s one of my favorite synth records of all time.”Assisting Holy Ghost! in the studio were many past DFA colleagues, including Sinkane, The Juan Maclean, and LCD Soundsystem member Nancy Whang, among others.As a first teaser of Work, the two-piece has shared the feel-good, seven-minute closing song “Escape from Los Angeles”.

"Big Thief are back with a new single called “Cattails”. The song comes from the band’s upcoming album, U.F.O.F., out May 3rd via 4AD, following up their excellent previous albums, 2016’s Masterpiece and 2017’s Capacity.Unlike the title track that dropped last week, which almost sounds like a Blonde Redhead B-side, “Cattails” meanders through quiet folk and backporch-style finger-picking. It’s a traditional folk song that feels as soft and hypnotic as the plant it gets its name from. According to the band’s primary singer and songwriter Adrianne Lenker, it was a song that came naturally to her, so much so that the band decided to record it on the spot after coming up with it.“Cattails came about while we were at the studio in Washington in the pine forest,” Lenker says in a press release. “Writing it was just one of those electric multicolored waves of connectivity just sweeping through my body. I stayed up late finishing the song and the next morning was stomping around playing it over and over again. We thought why not just record it, so James sat at the drums and we practiced and by the time we’d finished practicing, Dom Monks – our engineer – had already sneakily set up mics and recorded it. It was beautiful that he’d captured it right away because when James and I were playing it felt like a little portal in the fabric had opened and we were just flying. Listening back to it makes me cry sometimes.” See if it brings you to tears, too, after listening to it below.U.F.O.F. comes on the heels of two solo records from members of Big Thief. In the fall, Lenker released the sweeping, crisp album abysskiss. Just before that, guitarist and backup singer Buck Meek dropped his self-titled solo LP last summer. You can pre-order U.F.O.F. now, and grab those solo releases, along with Big Thief’s earlier records, on vinyl over at ReverbLP.Big Thief also added new dates to their upcoming tour.

"Hatchie is due to drop her debut album, Keepsake, on June 21st through Double Double Whammy. The rising indie songwriter is teasing her new LP now with “Stay with Me”.While impressive first single “Without a Blush” was steeped in fuzzy guitars à la My Bloody Valentine, today’s fresh cut leans harder toward the “pop” realm of the dream pop genre. “‘Stay With Me’ was written as a writing exercise in an effort to step away from my usual style into something more fun and dancey,” Hatchie commented in a press release.“We originally wrote it with someone else in mind, but realized it was the perfect fit for my album as I wanted to expand into a different sound,” she added. “It became one of my favourite songs on the record because I’m a sucker for crying-in-the-club tracks.”“Stay with Me” has the pulse of a Madonna hit from the late ’80s and early ’90s, and fits right in with similarly themed “crying-in-the-club tracks” like the entirety of Lorde’s Melodrama and, of course, Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own”.Check it out below via its official video. Directed and edited by Joe Agius, the clip stars Hatchie herself as she hits a nightclub in hopes of forgetting her relationship woes.Hatchie will kick off an extensive North American tour with Girlpool later this week.

"Here Comes the Cowboy is the fourth studio effort from Mac DeMarco, slated for release in May. The follow-up to 2017’s This Old Dog was hinted at with last month’s “Nobody” lead single. Now, a second track has been unboxed by the Canadian indie rocker.Dubbed “All of Our Yesterdays”, it was the first track penned by DeMarco for the new album. “Most of the rest of the songs were written in November right before we went on tour in Europe, but this one’s probably from about seven or eight months before that,” everyone’s favorite jizz jazzer explained in a statement. “I left it sitting with only one verse done for a long time, then finished it up while I was writing the rest of the record.”DeMarco noted that the song’s title phrase can be found in Macbeth, and also serves as the name of a Star Trek episode. Despite these possible sources of inspiration, though, DeMarco actually tried to channel one of British rock’s iconic acts: Oasis. He detailed:“I had just seen a documentary about Oasis before writing this song, and I was trying to write a gigantic rock and roll hit with my renewed love for the band. I didn’t really get close to that at all, but I’m happy with the song that came out hahahahaha.”Did DeMarco succeed in emulating the Gallagher brothers? Take a listen below.Here Comes the Cowboy, which DeMarco apparently made with zero knowledge of Mitski’s own Be the Cowboy, is due May 10th through DeMarco’s own Record Label. You can get DeMarco’s past albums on vinyl here.To support the new LP, DeMarco will be on the road from April all the way through November.

"In December, Phish frontman Trey Anastasio teased a mysterious new project dubbed Ghosts of the Forest. Now, just a few days before the band hits the road for their inaugural tour, the group has confirmed their forthcoming debut album and teased the collection with its psychedelic lead single.The jam spin-off’s self-titled release was captured at Vermont’s Barn Studio in April of last year over the course of a few days, with production and mixing from Vance Powell (Chris Stapleton, Jack White). For the project, Anastasio will be joined by Phish drummer Jon Fishman, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Celisse Henderson, and a handful of his Trey Anastasio Band collaborators, including Jennifer Hartswick, Tony Markellis, and Ray Paczkowski.(Read: 30 Most Anticipated Tours of 2019)Ghosts of the Forest is due out as a digital download starting Friday, April 12th. Later, on May 24th, the nine-track LP will become available on 180-gram vinyl featuring limited-edition, numbered rainbow foil packaging.As a first listen, the band has shared the effort’s title track. “Ghosts of the Forest” finds Anastasio and company offering a laid-back and psychedelic romp that deviates from the jam icon’s traditional sound. Inspired by the loss of a close friend to cancer, the new single finds the guitarist eschewing his more silly, whimsical, and improv-heavy impulses with Phish and TAB, instead leaning into spacious and airy, more indie rock-inspired sensibilities.

"The Get Up Kids are returning May 10th with a new album dubbed, Problems. Due out through Polyvinyl, it finds the indie emo rockers employing a “decidedly pop-minded approach to song structure” as they wrestle with modern-day anxieties.March brought us the first single, “Satellite”, which reflected on the feelings of loneliness and isolation one sometimes while on the road for too long. Now comes a second offering in “The Problem is Me”, which as its title implies, is all about examining the ways in which our own personal traumas can get in the way of self improvement.(Read: 20 Essential SXSW Acts To Catch on Tour This Spring)“The song is about a friend’s second divorce and about taking responsibility in a relationship,” the band’s Matt Pryor explained in a press statement. “For me, the song is about self care. Acknowledging personal faults and trying to work on them.”Check it out below via its official music video, filmed on Super 8 by director Shawn Brackbill.In addition to “The Problem is Me”, The Get Up Kids have announced a US tour set for July.

"Titus Andronicus have announced a new album, An Obelisk. Due out on June 21st on Merge Records, the follow-up to last year’s A Productive Cough features production from punk rock icon and the band’s recent tour mate Bob Mould.As detailed in an extensive feature on Stereogum, Mould’s involvement came after Titus Andronicus mastermind Patrick Stickles heard the Hüsker Dü frontman was a fan. Stickles reached out to Michael Azerrad, a mutual connection who had co-written Mould’s autobiography, See a Little Light: The Trail of Rage and Melody, to gauge Mould’s interest. Not long after, they had booked time at Steve Albini’s Electrical Audio studio in Chicago, where they lived and recorded for six days as they sought to “”capture the essential sound of the band,” as Mould put it.Mould’s role was more of a guiding hand and mentor as opposed to someone making major decisions on the recordings. “He’s got such a strong vision,” he said of Stickles. “You have to be mindful that he sort of knows what he wants already, as far as the spiritual side of it.”(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Legacy Rock Albums of 2019)For his part, Stickles also knew he wanted to get back to the no-nonsense rock of Titus’ pre-Productive Cough material. That album’s deliberate divergence was his way of trying to “renegotiate my contract with the audience,” as he put it. In fact, much of the music on Obelisk predates the material from that 2018 release, stemming even as far back as 2015’s The Most Lamentable Tragedy. Stickles expounded,“I don’t want to get pigeonholed. I was trying to illuminate my essential purpose as an artist, which is to be a communicator and a validator. The loud rock ‘n’ roll music is one of the tools I feel entitled to use at times. But the tool is not the thing that matters, it’s the result.”With An Obelisk, he’s returned to to-the-point indie punk with a literary bend. The 38 minutes of the album follow a fictional variation of Stickle’s own journey, “part of a story of an individual’s personal and intellectual development.” Over 10 tracks, the songwriting oscillates from monologic diatribes against the world at large to reflective soliloquies in which the narrator wrestles with his own identity. “The conclusion is the narrator says, ‘I’m going to try and be a kinder person,’” Stickles explained.As a first listen, Titus Andronicus have revealed one of the LP’s monologues, “(I Blame) Society”. Befitting its title, the ringing rocker is a screed against the failings of societal structures. “They provide a dried out dream, lying through their teeth/ I find the 1/1000th of 1% are thriving by deceit,” Stickles delivers in his frayed bark. Check out the song below via its accompanying lyric video.Pre-orders for An Obelisk are live now.

"Last night, Better Oblivion Community Center continued their inaugural tour with a standout performance at New York City’s Brooklyn Steel. During the show, the fan-favorite duo of Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers surprised fans to a cover of Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s “Shallow”.The track from A Star is Born would generally not be thought of as “on brand” for the indie outfit. However, on the night of the Oscars telecast last month, after Gaga and Cooper delivered a truly stunning rendition of the tune, Bridgers hinted at the cover’s possibility. She posted, “petition to make conor do shallow with me on tour” on Twitter, which generated thousands of positive responses.For last night’s show, BOCC were joined by guitarist Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, who also appeared on “Dylan Thomas” and “Dominoes” off the group’s self-titled debut in January. For the encore, both Oberst and Bridgers rose to the challenge of the Academy Award-winning tune, delivering a powerful and emotive performance. Watch for yourself below.“Shallow” marks yet another entry in Better Oblivion Community Center’s expanding catalog of covers. Since their tour started in March, the group has reinterpreted some unexpected tunes, including Death Cab for Cutie’s “Title and Registration”, The Replacements’ “Can’t Hardly Wait”, and The Killers’ “Human”.Meanwhile, during another recent show in New York City, BOCC performed a new original song called “Little Trouble”, which you can see footage of below.BOCC’s US tour runs through mid-March, and you can get tickets here.",articles40,"['Conor Oberst', 'Cooper', 'Nick Zinner', '“Shallow', 'Death Cab', 'The Killers’']"
"Inter Arma return with their fourth album, Sulphur English, on April 12th, via Relapse Records, and the Richmond, Virginia, band has teamed up with Heavy Consequence to premiere the video for the epic new song “Howling Lands” (watch below).With a sound that is undefinable at times, but combines elements of doom, sludge, psychedelic, and black metal, Inter Arma have steadily risen in the heavy scene since releasing their debut LP, Sundown, in 2010, and evolving on their next two albums — 2013’s Sky Burial and 2016’s Paradise Gallows.“Howling Lands” starts with a marching drum beat, before sludgy guitar riffs and dueling blackened and doom vocals take listeners on an epic journey into the “center of hell”, as depicted magnificently in the accompanying music video, directed by Marcos Morales.Vocalist Mike Paparo reveals that the song has political overtones, explaining, “It’s very, very veiled, but it’s social commentary saying, ‘Hey, if you let these people walk all over you, this is what’s gonna happen. If you let your material stuff and your ego get in the way, these people will control you. You’re gonna be a pawn to these elite scum.'”Sulpher English is available for pre-order at this location. Inter Arma will play the Decibel Metal & Beer Fest on April 12th, and perform at an 8th anniversary celebration for the Brooklyn, New York, venue Saint Vitus on April 13th.

"With two new albums and a massive tour in quick succession, one has to wonder when Ariana Grande has time to even sit down for a Starbucks drink. Nevertheless, the super human pop star is back today to defy the odds with the release of a new song titled “Monopoly”.The track is a joint track with BFF and longtime collaborator Victoria Monét. Her name might not jump out at you, but Monét’s work certainly will — she has songwriting credits on Ari’s smash singles “thank u, next” and “7 Rings”, among countless other tracks off her last three albums. Additionally, Monét has worked with Janelle Monáe, Fifth Harmony, and Nas.

"Last week, The Social Experiment members Nico Segal and Nate Fox teased a new project called Intellexual. Today, the two have offered more details on what they’ve been cooking up in the studio.Intellexual is both the duo’s new band name and title of their debut album. The forthcoming LP, due to hit stores April 12th, spans a total of 11 songs, including titles like “Sing it Louder”, “Overthinking”, “Roxstar”, and “Friction”. Most were written “from scratch at a piano or guitar”, their details fleshed out before “going into the studio with a firm-footed plan, instead of piecing together scraps.” A press statement explained further:“They built the songs up from these early demos, adding color in the form of euphoric horns, rippling pianos, handclaps, synthesizers and background vocals of various timbres. The result is an inventive, genre-bending album that erases the boundaries between hip-hop, soul, folk, R&B, indie-pop and dreamy atmospherics — a headphones record and a party record in one, both communal and personal in scope.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Hip-Hop Albums of 2019)As we previously noted, Segal and Fox were assisted by a long list of friends and colleagues, many from their Chicago hometown. Among them: Francis Starlite of Francis and the Lights, Chuck Inglish, Raury, Ric Wilson, fellow Social Experimenter Peter Cottontale, and Segal’s Kids These Days band mate Vic Mensa.As a first preview, the duo has shared a new song dubbed “Intlxl”.

"Later this week comes the release of The Seduction of Kansas, the latest album from Priests. The Washington, DC outfit’s sophomore effort follows Nothing Feels Natural from 2017 and is being teased today with “Jesus’ Son”.While the LP’s title track made use of glossier synths, this new offering finds Priests diving back into the searing punk of their earlier days. Singer Katie Alice Greer leads the way with her forceful vocals, which are complemented nicely by shredding, sawtoothed guitars. If Ex Hex didn’t bring enough hefty guitar power last week, look no further than “Jesus’ Son”.According to a press release, the song nods “to Lou Reed’s declaration that he felt ‘just like Jesus’ Son’ way back when, a statement that launched a thousand others who perhaps too have felt like the son of god at one point or another.” Priests add, “Many inquiring minds have already said they’d like to know who the song is about, it is certainly an apocalyptic sci-fi tale of epic proportions… perhaps it is about more than just a person?”(Read: The 50 Albums That Shaped Punk Rock)The track is accompanied by a music video that’s heavily inspired by the 1994 “March of the Pigs” clip from Nine Inch Nails. The band elaborated further:“The mythology of a rock band relies heavily on building a captivating arsenal of visual signifiers, one of which is often a ‘live performance’ music video. I put quotations around live performance because usually these are theatrically staged pantomimes of what the band would like the viewer to believe the actual live experience of their work to be like. We decided to try our hand at this as an expression of our identity— we are, in fact, a rock band— and so, we pay homage to those who have come before us (Blink 182, the Stone Roses, the Smiths, and perhaps most explicitly here, Nine Inch Nails). So now you know, in case you didn’t before: we are a rock band.Check out the dramatic visual, which was helmed by Greer alongside David Ashton.The John Congleton-produced Seduction of Kansas arrives April 5th through Sister Polygon Records.

"News emerged this week that attorney's for Fyre Media are working alongside federal judges to gain approval to subpoena Netflix and Hulu. The legal strategy behind the tactic is hoping one or both streaming services used assets owned by Fyre Media during the production of their EDM Documentary series. According to most legal experts…the case is currently a long shot and a subpoena will likely get denied. Even if a judge does sign off on one, the lawyers for the streaming services will undoubtedly double down on protecting their companies profits. The hope behind the subpoena stems from the fact that if either company used Fyre Media assets, the company can collect on the revenue earned from the EDM Documentary. Collecting on the documentaries can help pay towards the tens of millions of dollars Fyre Media owes those it frauded throughout its time as an operational company.

"The key to catching great secret sets at music festivals is to always be on the lookout on artist's social media. Those subtle or not-so-subtle hints are your clues for when and where to catch these sets. Diplo did just that this past weekend at Coachella to announce a surprise Major Lazer set.After his set as Diplo, the DJ went to Twitter to announce that he “might have one more set” in him. Diplo and bandmates Walshy Fire and Jillionaire joined together to put on a banging performance as Major Lazer at Coachella's DoLab.And, Major Lazer wasn't the only one that made a surprise appearance.

"Many festivals around the world all have their signature landmarks. Mysteryland has the enormous teddy bear. Electric Forest has its art installations scattered throughout the woods. Tomorrowland has some level of an enormous anthropomorphic stage. Coachella has its iconic Ferris wheel. While many people look at the signature Ferris Wheel and think they want to get a photo, this year for some reason…it seems that everyone is looking at the wheel and thinking to themselves – “I need to f**k in that thing”. The past week has consisted of several videos surfacing on Twitter of people getting various kinds of freaking inside the closed in booths of the Coachella Ferris wheel. Needless to say, these videos are all very NSFW. Folks, if Coachella is moving you to the point of where public sex on a Ferris Wheel seems like a good idea, it is time to take a step back, have a deep breath and go back to your tent with your boo instead. But if you do decide to undergo this new right of passage, just remember…the internet sees all…and never forgets. “i’m strictly here for the music”  — Pax Impera (@paximpera) LOL!

There really is no rest for this man as he keeps his momentum going continuously and luckily for the fans in attendance they received a special treat.  At the show he gave everyone a little taste of what's to come with famed DJ/producer ZHU.

Besides that personal statement, the guys are at it once again teasing the world with some kind of announcement coming in the near future. This time it seems to be new music.

"While Marshmello wasn't on the official 2019 Coachella lineup, the DJ still found himself on stage a couple of times over the weekend.Having collaborations with what feels like almost every big artist on the Charts, Marshmello could have made appearances all weekend. The masked DJ came on stage for Khalid during “Silence” and with CHVRCHES for their  “Here With Me”.Marshmello hilariously came on stage with Khalid holding a microphone, but it obviously wasn't used. Marshmello defaulted to dancing around the stage while the collab played. For CHVRCHES set, the DJ had a different instrument with him – a guitar.

"Andrew Bayer has always been, and will most likely continue to be one of my favorite producers. In fact, reviewing his track ‘Once Lydian' was the article I submitted to EDM Sauce with my resume in hopes of starting to write about dance music…the rest is history. Now, nearly 6 years later, I find myself just as captivated by his otherworldly productions as I was when I was first just beginning to review music. His latest release, AlbumsIf you couldn't tell by the subheading of this section. I feel that this album is absolutely gorgeous from beginning to end. I was worried that it would not carry enough difference from its predecessor to be discussed. I quickly found that my fears were baseless. The opening moments, of ‘Tidal Wave' when the overwhelming onslaught of orchestral synths rings out before giving way to the classic, Bayer driving, Relaxing Music, feel-good beat is nothing short of breathtaking. The album weaves from high-intensity tracks such as ‘Love You More' with Genix and ‘Hold On To You' to more gentle, progressive tunes like ‘In My Last Life' and ‘End of All Things'.The one constant factor throughout is that Bayer has injected new life into eight of his best works yet. While these Songs are all familiar, they have been crafted with a caring hand to become something new, and awe-inspiring. One of the most incredible aspects of EDM to me is the fact that artists can take any existing works and rework it into something new. The concept of remixing is not exclusive to dance music, but most heavily affiliated with the umbrella term for electronic production. Bayer has taken the concept of remixing and created something new and original with it. Not only has he reworked his original productions…twice over now. But he has done so in a way which feels authentic and time intensive. There is truly nothing better than hearing Bayer's signature high-intensity intros melt into hauntingly gorgeous lyrics before giving way to a melodic break that brings the listener to a higher plane of musical existence. It is something that many artists attempt to do, but fail to capture the emotional weight Bayer seems to constantly capture with a deft hand. Listen to this gorgeous exercise in production below. Stay on a lookout for all things Andrew Bayer, because he undoubtedly has more surprises planned as 2019 pushes on. ",articles9,"['…', 'Genix', '…']"

The second that the children's song, ‘Baby Shark' hit the airwaves in an insane resurgence, fans were pretty insistent that Jauz try his hand at remixing the track. After months of waiting, and a lot more teasing than was probably necessary – Jauz finally gave the world what it thought it wanted for so long yesterday at Coachella.Like all things in life, the remix was met with mixed reviews, as many people were pretty confused about what was happening. Obviously, Coachella doesn't match up 100% with the EDM Twitter demographic.

While the original was upbeat in nature, the way Galantis is able to inject palpable energy into their productions helps elevate this track to a plain of Relaxing Music existence.

That original wasn't enough for the shining star of hybrid trap and bass. Just yesterday, NGHTMRE debuted a truly next level VIP of ‘REDLIGHT' that will leave you slack-jawed on the first drop. This remix unleashes a full out onslaught of aggressive machine gun bass right out the gate and only further doubles down on intensity as the track progresses.

"Avicii passed away nearly a year ago. April 20th of 2018 will live on as a haunting day in the world of music. Avicii was an incredibly talented musician and touched countless lives as a producer, DJ, and humanitarian. While there have been many tracks released in memorial and remixes created in the wake of Avicii's passing, today marks the first time a new track which was officially produced by Tim has seen release since his death. The track features Aloe Blacc on vocals, who fans will immediately know from his previous work with Avicii, ‘Wake Me Up'. ‘SOS' is a gorgeous track, but while listening to the song, the devastating reality sets in. While this track is upbeat in nature, its lyrics are truly a cry for help. While we may never be able to see Tim play live again, his music will truly live on forever. Take a listen to the new song below and see the story behind the track as well. ",articles9,[None]
"One of the most surreal and iconic moments from last year's Coachella was when Wethan brought out Mason Ramsey, who had just found viral fame for his Walmart yodeling video, for a song during his set at the Sahara Stage. The crowd absolutely ate it up. Turns out, the duo's relationship has continued since that day. As we are now on the eve of Coachella 2019, it only seems right that the duo would be back in the studio cooking up something unique. Lil Nas X has enjoyed a wild ride of fame since his track ‘Old Town Road' has begun topping Charts in multiple genres. The western inspired rap is catchy, grosses audience barriers and is just across the board fun. It seems that Mason and Whethan are looking to put their own unique spin of the megahit. Will this little project get debuted at Coachella this year? Only time will tell, but these guys certainly have something up their sleeve. horsin’ around — Mason Ramsey (@masonramsey) ",articles9,"['Lil Nas X', 'Whethan']"
"Odesza has an otherworldly quality about them. For me, I think their entire lore kicked off on the opening notes of the intro for their debut Albums I had to Google this term cause I still am not entirely sure if it is a real word, or just made up at some point to describe a feeling that was otherwise indescribable – Anemoia. It means longing for a feeling you have never known. I bring this up as there is no better way to summarize the Sundara 2019 aftermovie. While only a handful of fans could affordable the once in a lifetime trip down to Mexico to take part in Odesza's very first festival, it ended up being a massive success. The aftermovie which just dropped yesterday will inject a sense of nostalgia for an experience you might have never known yourself. It seemingly doesn't make sense, but just like with most things Odesza does – it will make you feel palpable and powerful emotion. Check out the video below. ",articles9,"['kicked', 'Sundara']"
"This story has almost written itself. Jauz took his shark imagery seriously from the very beginning…how could he not with a name like Jauz. Nobody could have ever seen that backfiring. Then an incredibly catchy children's song had a resurgence and became hauntingly omnipresent. Naturally with the new popularity of ‘Baby Shark' fans were immediately asking Jauz to step up to the plate and do what needed to be done. Jauz responded to the pressure from fans by testing their dedication to him remixing the track. He asked for a tweet to hit 10K RTs, and sure enough, within hours, the mark was reached. It was time to put his money where his mouth was. After many months, and several teasers – Jauz has announced when his Baby Shark remix will be heard by the public for the very first time. Make sure if you are at Coachella, you hit the Sahara stage for his set, and if you aren't in attendance, check out the live stream to catch every moment of the action. All I’m gonna say is if you wanna hear the baby shark remix for the first time ever you should probably be at Sahara 3:50-4:45 👶 🦈 — JAUZ (@Jauzofficial) ",articles9,"['Jauz', 'Jauz', 'Jauz', 'Jauz', 'Baby Shark', 'Sahara', 'Sahara', 'JAUZ']"
"We are on the eve of Coachella 2019 folks. That means in traditional fashion, the iconic festival has started flooding their social media with content for attendees currently traveling out the Indio, California. As with any festival of this caliber, set times demonstrate that the entire experience is one big cluster of set conflicts. There is simply no way for the festival to accommodate all the hopes of fans. Hard decisions will have to be made this weekend. Interestingly enough we get to take some sneak peeks of who is doing what this year based off of set times. It seems the festival has begun to entirely grasp the importance EDM plays in its continued success. Each night a smattering of some of dance music's finest will be closing down stages left and right. While some choices are simple (duh Prydz over Grande on Sunday), others will leave attendees spinning with mixed emotions. Check out the full list of set times below and get ready for some turmoil in your heart. Remember if you are not heading out to SoCal for the festival this year, you can check out our live stream of the event starting Friday. Plan accordingly — Coachella (@coachella) ",articles9,[None]

"This is one heck of an unexpected collaboration. To say this unlikely group of three very different artists uniting on a single was a surprise is an understatement. So how does this blend of genres, styles, and personalities sound when all rolled into one package? Well actually, like exactly how you might think. ‘Next Life' has no shortage of strength in its main melody. It is an upbeat tune that features synths which soar sky high and crash down with emotional weight. It is a gorgeous melding of both Crankdat and Adventure Club's styles. While both artists are noticeable throughout, not once does the collaboration feel forced or feature the old trope of one artist handles one verse, and the other handles the next. Krewella adds in vocals as well as their usual level of intensity which works alongside the other collaborators in a natural and exciting fashion. In short, this song works beautifully. At first, I was skeptical seeing a list of this many names on one single but it seems that this group of 5 producers made this fall in line perfectly. Check it out below.

"What's going on Dance Music Fans! We are bringing you a brand new Artist of the Week to our web site; Please welcome Newclaess & Matluck!“This track is very special for us as we did a track with a guy who is working with nicky romero, felix jaehn, dzeko, matisse & sadko and so on. Which is very important to us as we grow our name with that immensely. for the track itself it is our most groovy track we ever made. the track combines perfect vibes with the perfectly matching vocal. we feel like this could be a good candidate for the summer 2019.”Modern dance and Pop music duo, Newclaess resonates from Southern Germany with their
unique style, airy sound and dynamic artistry. Making their mark in the international music
circuit, they have received support from the likes of Martin Garrix, Hardwell, Lost
Frequencies, Klingande, Steve Aoki and many more on their last release.
Merging their talents and skills after meeting the first time in 2008, DJs Jan and Tobias
began frequenting the German club scene. Taking a 3 year hiatus to focus on producing
professionally, the duo reemerged in 2015 with performances at the international Lake
Festival (AT) and Open Beatz Festival (DE) and shared the stage with Nicky Romero, R3hab
and Calvin Harris.With the release of their single “Feel Alive” on the record label Planet Punk, Newclaess
caught the attention of Universal Music (SA) and went on to work with other artists on over
40 compilation projects worldwide including Future Trance on Universal Music. Ending that
year on a high note, their hit single “Tonight” gained 800K streams within 3 months of its
release.Building on the momentum, Newclaess teamed up with South German DJ/Producer
“Cuebrick” for their 12th single titled “Fly” featuring Maliha, which gained over 600K plays on Spotify and YouTube within one week and ranked 41st on the Austrian Viral Charts. To date, “Fly” has surpassed well over 2 million plays and made it to Germany’s ‘bigFM’ radio
station’s “Top Five”.We had the chance to sit down with this incredible duo and they had a ton to say about their creative process and up and coming plans for 2019!:“We usually start with a rwa vocal. from there we start with chord and think about how to arrange the track and everything else… sometime we also have it the other way round and produce something that's in our head and get vocals afterwards. sometimes we also work from a song we heard as a REFERENCE were we feel we could do something new to it.”They have some huge plans for 2019 as well:“Our plans for 2019 are pretty strong. we are planning to release about 10 more tracks this year and we are already having big collaborations going on. we teamed up with some new partners and are preparing and producing a lot of exciting music for 2019.”Wow! We are totally blown away at the immense success this young duo is already having in their early career. We are so happy to be part of it here at EDMsauce and cannot wait to see these two EXPLODE this Summer! Thanks for stopping by!",articles9,"['Martin Garrix', 'Lost\nFrequencies', 'Klingande', 'Steve Aoki', 'Nicky Romero', 'Cuebrick', 'Maliha', '! We']"
"The Bass Music scene has been singing Soltan's praises ever since he touched down in 2015 with his unique, Eastern-inspired beats. Intriguing fans with his meticulous production and ‘less is more' approach to the limelight, the producer continues to build on recent successes with brand new single ‘Face Slam'.Having hinted at the release on social media throughout this week, Soltan has been riling up the dubstep community by teasing what sounds like it could be one of his best productions to date. And now that release day has finally arrived, we can safely say that this is a track that was entirely worth the wait. In classic Soltan style, the producer fuses catchy melodies with driving bass and infectious riffs – a recipe for success as proved by his booming catalogue on Never Say Die. Perfectly pairing modern bass influence with his trademark Eastern sonics, Soltan has created yet another masterpiece with his newest offering.Get a taste of ‘Face Slam' below and grab your copy .",articles9,"['Soltan', 'Soltan', 'Eastern', 'Soltan']"
"Yesterday, Getter made the heartbreaking announcement that he will be canceling the rest of his Visceral tour. The artist has received  throughout the tour but has kept going for his love of the Albums. But, after events at Ultra and other festivals, Getter officially announced that he will be canceling the rest of the tour due to severe criticism and hate.It all started in Housten when the DJ was literally booed for not playing more hardstyle, dubstep music. Getter then faced even more backlash at Ultra this past weekend. From fans throwing objects on stage and more, that was enough for the DJ. As of last night, there were seven stops left on the Visceral tour, along with a few festival stops.Getter has shown his diversity as an artist throughout the years. From producing trap to dubstep to rap, he is truly an ever-changing artist. And artists should have the freedom to produce whatever they feel. We're sad to see him cancel the rest of his tour, but hopefully, the EDM community will take this as a learning lesson.you win —  (@GetterOfficial) ",articles9,['Yesterday']
"Multi-instrumentalist producer and performer GRiZ has released his fifth studio Albums, Ride Waves and it does NOT disappoint. Drenched in the creative passion and cultural connectivity of the artist, the Albums sees GRiZ immerse himself into the soundscapes of his influences and the causes of today.Everything that GRiZ does encapsulates a feeling. Whether it be the heartache of tragedy or the thrill of success, every sentiment, commitment, or track he makes embodies just how it feels to be a human under the weight of modernity. The result is an artist, producer, philanthropist and LGBTQ advocate living a legacy of love and positivity.Ride Waves is the culmination of the last two years for GRiZ––a period pillared by his own creative exile, high impact socio-cultural issues, and a slew of communities and relationships in which he has embedded himself.Grant armed the album with a multitude of genres; not as a spectator, but instead, he sunk himself into these societal landscapes to produce something as authentic as it is timely. He tapped hip-hop favorites like Wiz Khalifa on  DRAM for  Funk-icon Bootsy Collins on  and Matisyahu for their Reggae hymn . His sonic journey touched down in New York’s urban core to record with the Harlem Gospel Choir, stepped into Chicago’s South Side to collaborate with a children’s choir, and spanned across many sessions in New Orleans. Snoop Dogg even lent a hand in creating My Friends And I Pt. 2.There’s truly something for everybody in the album. Each song tips a hat to Grant’s personality, and many parts of this represent moments of reflection. GRiZ and Matisyahu were in the studio soon after last year’s Parkland shooting, and wrote a song about gun violence,  became of it. The song was  which features stories from multiple people impacted by gun violence.  Grant, in partnership with , used the video to encourage fans to unite against gun violence by asking their federal representatives to pass universal background checks.Stream/Purchase ‘Ride Waves' Here:  Ride Waves comes paired with a world tour, which will kick off at the beginning of May and will see him touch down everywhere from Brooklyn to The Netherlands, to the eclectic stages of Shambhala, Firefly, and lastly, Bonnaroo where he has the honor curating this year’s Superjam.GRiZ is a youth culture hero; he lives and breathes to better the communities around him not only through his art but also his actions. Last year marked the five-year anniversary of his charitable event series 12 Days Of GRiZMAS – which to date has raised over $100,000 towards music education for Detroit public school students. Adding to this, he recently released his own GRiZMAS coffee blend, which donated all of its proceeds to the same cause. Last year in celebration of Giving Tuesday,  with Dan Savage’s foundation  which aims to empower, uplift and inspire the nation’s youth members of the LGBTQ community. By no coincidence, “It Gets Better” stands as one of the foundation’s anthems as they prep to continue their partnership later this year.Ride Waves sees GRiZ enter a new realm of production prowess defined by collaboration and an unwavering sense of progression. It is from this new vantage point that he is simultaneously connected to both the history of contemporary music and its evolution. From here there is only growth, respect, and the refining of a new generation.Stream/Purchase Ride Waves Album: Buy tickets at  01. Can’t Get Enough

"Philly native Tommy Capretto has his hands in a lot of jars in the dance music industry. Whether or not he is producing gritty house tracks, he's DJ'ing a gig, being label head of Summoned Record, or getting behind the decks of syndicated radio shows, Capretto is stape in the east coast house scene and making way worldwide.We got the chance to talk with Tommy about his upcoming tunes, his style of house music, future of his label, tips for new producers and much more so give it a read below!1) We at EDMSAUCE are really diggin’ one of your latest releases, with Richard Fraioli! What’s the story behind that track and how it came about?TOMMY CAPRETTO: Thank you guys so much! I met Richard last year during Miami Music Week at his set at Nikki Beach and we just clicked. We were just sitting there talking about video games. Nothing about music or anything. We exchanged info and kept in contact and we decided we should collaborate on something since we're both complete house heads. He was really digging,  which was barely even a concept at the time, and we worked on it sending files back and forth and jumping on Facetime.2) How would you describe your sound? How do you separate yourself from the rest of the music producers & DJs out there? What exactly is “the Tommy Capretto sound,” if you had to describe it?TOMMY CAPRETTO: My sound is definitely dirty and edgy. I love very punchy kicks and super fat basslines. I think what I love most while producing is finding or creating a vocal that makes people laugh. I just actually finished up a really hard tune called,  My manager’s assistant Tori did some voiceovers for my radio show,  on Dash Radio, and I loved it so much I created an entire original out of it! I absolutely love sampling things for my shows.3) What’s your DJ-style like (you can give specific examples of portions of your setlist if that makes it easier to explain) as a LIVE performer?TOMMY CAPRETTO: Honestly, this may sound cliche, but I love dropping acapellas over records. It just makes each set more unique. As a performer, If there's one thing that’s important to me, it's connecting with the crowd.4) You’re based in Philadelphia. What’s the scene like there? Where else do you play? Got any current residencies?TOMMY CAPRETTO: I’m based in Philly, yeah. The scene is very open-format. Lots and lots of hip-hop. There are a few venues that cater more to the house-techno scene on certain days. But definitely more open format than anything. I took a break from gigging to get into the studio to finish up some projects. My last event in Philly, however, was with Chus & Ceballos at NOTO nightclub which is a really dope spot.5) What’s the biggest gig – it can be a festival or a nightclub, or even a private event – you’ve ever played? When/where was it? What made it so special that it stands-out? (Be specific.)TOMMY CAPRETTO: One of the biggest gigs I've played was an indoor festival at Levels Nightclub in Scranton, PA. It's such a cool spot with multiple levels.6) You’ve worked with some major record labels. Which ones/which releases? What’s different about your approach when working with major labels versus “indie” labels?TOMMY CAPRETTO: I've done a remix project for Dragonette on their song  which was an incredible record. Those three are so talented. They performed the remix on their tour which was amazing. I also did a few official mixes for Capitol and Universal Records on Niall Horan’s  as well as MNEK and Hailee Steinfeld’s  Currently, I'm working on another remix for Capitol Records on Fletcher’s 7) What’s the vision behind your Summoned Records label? What’s the label’s philosophy?TOMMY CAPRETTO: When I think of summoned, I think about summoning up your passion. Summon up your feelings and make what makes you move. My philosophy is to make music that summons people to the dancefloor.8) Where can fans expect to see you next (i.e. big shows, etc.)?TOMMY CAPRETTO: For Miami Music Week, I played 418 Mission Miami party at Fire & Ice Lounge in South Beach Wednesday the 27th. I did a set at Robbie Rivera’s Juicy Beach event at The Clevelander Friday, March 29th, and April 25th I'll be opening for Ice-T and Mr. X at Schimanski nightclub in Brooklyn for an EBE Nation event. Stay tuned for more!9) What upcoming releases (i.e. singles, Albums’s, Albums, remixes, etc.) can fans look forward from you, next?TOMMY CAPRETTO: My latest release just came out on Rippin Records called,  I also have another track coming out on Robbie Rivera’s label, Juicy Music, called, 10) In your opinion, what’s the most important thing for aspiring DJs/producers reading this to know about the music industry? What essential advice can you give them?TOMMY CAPRETTO: My ultimate advice is, MAKE FRIENDS! Build relationships with your peers. That’s so important. Most of all, make the kind of music that moves YOU!Instagram:

"2019 has been a massive year already for Morgan Page. With his latest original single  still riding high across clubland as well as 2 MEGA remixes already dominating radio waves across the USA, Morgan Page now turns his attention to Alessia Cara’s beautifully sublime single  delivering a remix worlds away from the energy of the original while still just as delicately produced.Where Cara’s original hit is a slow, dreamy whisper of a single, Page’s feet are firmly on the dance floor, injecting huge energy and drive into the production and completely transforming the cut. Cara’s vocal still floats effortlessly on top, Pageonce again proving his incredible ability to retain the pure sensibilities of pop music, but thrusting percussion, pared synths and rushing piano and organ sections quickly elevate the track into ‘hands-in-the-air’ territory.Check out this progressive beauty below!",articles9,['Morgan Page']
"“Words truly can't describe just how incredible it feels to have granted this wish for Kara. I've always known about Make-A-Wish and the incredible work they do but never in my life did I think I'd be able to offer anything of worth for them, let alone granting a wish! So when I first heard that Kara's wish was to record in a professional studio I thought “wow, I can actually make that happen, how cool is that!”… The feeling was so awesome that it made me nervous! When Kara arrived in LA she showed up with so much confidence, talent and a charismatic personality! I immediately felt this connection that I only get from the special artists who've worked with me for a long time. We recorded a lot of different ideas, and all of them were amazingly beautiful, especially this song ‘Ready To Start'. It's a song about hope, bravery and thinking about all the amazing things you want to do when you grow up. ‘Ready To Start' is about standing up proud, being strong, fighting fears and having the courage to just be who you are. To love and believe in yourself.”– Wish I Was says",articles9,"['Kara', '! So', 'Kara']"

"David Guetta is always a true wonder when he takes to main stages all over the world. All of his sets pail in comparison to what he does for Ultra Music Festival though. Even after nearly three decades of producing, Guetta leaves nothing to chance. This year during his Ultra 2019 main stage set, Guetta took no prisoners as he opened up his massive set with a new Edit of his forthcoming release with Tiesto. So far, all we can confirm is that this ID is a collaboration between the two legends. Past that, the release date and additional info is still unknown. That being said, being able to take a listen to this massive tune before it has seen an official label release is exciting. Take a listen below. We cannot wait until this one gets released.

"If there was any debate that The Chainsmokers are two of the hardest working guys in the dance music industry, their 2019 Ultra Main Stage set closes that case. Alex and Drew not only closed down the festival on its main stage but did so in spectacular fashion. While Ultra Music Festival is known for the massive amount of new music debuted over the weekend, The Chainsmokers took things a step further. Throughout their hour-plus set, the guys dropped THIRTEEN never before heard singles and edits. That's right – over 10 unreleased tunes graced this set throughout.

"In recent years, Zedd has demonstrated he has his finger on the pulse of both dance and popular music. After wracking up Grammy nominations, Charts-topping hits, and so much more, it is still a ton of fun to see Zedd really let things rip in an entirely EDM friendly environment. Zedd's Ultra 2019 Main Stage set has already been hallowed by fans, peers and critics alike. One of the most exciting moments in his mix is at the 23:40 mark. At this point, Zedd transitions into a true showstopper of a tune, which is yet to be identified by even the team over at 1001 Tracklists. We cannot even say for sure that this is a Zedd original.

"One of the most exciting performances at Ultra Music Festival this year was the return of Dog Blood. The side project consisting of Skrillex and Boys Noize is back in action after a year-long hiatus. The duo took to the stage at Buku Music Festival three weeks ago, but clearly, they were saving something special for Ultra. The duo dropped a ridiculous, almost criminal amount of unreleased tunes. Some of these IDs have been heard before in sets by Skrillex, but some are entirely Ultra exclusives. It is clear that both Dog Blood and Skrillex are sitting on a true wealth of new music.

"Martin Garrix's return to Ultra Music Festival this past weekend was a long time coming. After missing the flagship event last year, Garrix returned like Napoleon from Elba to tear down the Ultra Music Festival Mainstage. Martin wasted absolutely no time jumping into the mix as the crowd was met with an onslaught of absolute HEATERS. A few tracks stood out though. Throughout his hour+ set, Garrix dropped a few IDs. One of which we can confirm is his own production, the other is definitely on his label, but the producer is still unknown.

"What's going on dance music fans! We always love bringing you the best up and coming artists every single day here at EDMsauce.com! Today, we are featuring yet another incredible talent in our Artist of the Week Series; Please help us welcome CTZNJ!CTZNJ is an up and comer with a ton of talent combining a super groovy pop style with future bass sounds, original riffs, and a real taste making quality that we fail to find in new music from new artists. We would love to feature his newest track below, which is a remix of LANY's Malibu Nights that brings the lyrics to life with CTZNJ's heavy bass riffs, deeply sidechained kicks, and of course the quality you'd come to expect from such a young and professional talent!We were lucky enough to sit down with this awesome, young, talented artist to get a bit of insight into his creative process. His response was very interesting as he alluded to the fact that we are all small pieces to the music world and the sounds that we hear simply just bring us all together as one:“the vision for my music from the beginning has been to discover and craft the CTZNSND (Citizen Sound). I wanted to be this figure CTZNJ with the idea that if your name is Kris, you are CTZNK and we are all part of the broader CTZNSND.”Building off of his idea of creating a continuity with his music, we asked if CTZNJ can expand on this, which led to him divulging some inside information to up and coming music and his talents expand beyond the electronic world and include guitar and saxophone:“Bringing people together, spreading love through these tunes. I plan on releasing a remix of my homie Christian French’s song Love Ride next. Eventually I will collect these remixes into an Albums called the Heartbreak Headbanger Remixes. I play the sax and guitar – i'm working on my live show right now that incorporates these instruments.”We were so happy to be able to speak with such a creative mind and really get some insight, learning that CTZNJ really isn't making music for the sake of being famous, playing the largest stages in the world, rather, he is bringing us all together in a cohesive manner that manner talents overlook; this is at the heart of what CTZNJ brings to the table and allows us to honor him as our Artist of the week. Check out his socials below and be sure to follow CTZNJ! Thanks so much for tuning into yet another Artist of the Week Series!  ",articles9,"['! We', 'Kris', '! Thanks']"

Always sure to provide an onslaught of multi genre anthems, Danny has released a commercial-leaning track especially for his birthday festivities.This release follows a recent Hard Dance collaboration with Will Sparks. ‘Fat Beat’ allowed the dance music enthusiast to immerse himself in the harder-hitting genre.

As the first release from Danny’s new imprint, he’s expressed excitement at being unleashed from the limitations of labels. ‘Thinking About You' boasts melodic tones and hints of tropical appeal, suggesting that summer is, in fact, on its way.We look forward to more from this determined young talent (whose summer schedule is looking jam-packed), as well as the new freedom he finds in NUMB3R5.Check out ‘Thinking About You' below and don't forget to grab your copy .",articles9,[None]
"In an interesting development, Fyre Media CEO, Billy McFarland has announced the follow up to his failed 2017 venture, Fyre Festival. It seems that McFarland is dead set of creating an intimate experience as only a single ticket is available for purchase. The ticket starts at $27.4 Million, which oddly enough – is the exact same amount McFarland settled with the FTC to pay back. We spoke to McFarland in an exclusive interview about his decision to create a new Fyre Festival experience. We will say that McFarland only spoke with us after we agreed to put $30 on his books for “a few soups to trade with, some slides and a few shots of coffee”. “It is the ultimate exclusive experience,” said McFarland. “That is what went wrong last time, we tried to do too much. So this time, we are only offering one ticket, that way we cannot get overwhelmed.”When pressed on the location of Fyre Festival 2.0, McFarland only stated that it would be somewhere with amply water. “Yeah, we are trying to avoid anyone having to suck d*ck this year. That was a doozy after those EDM Documentary. My partner Ja Rule said that Flint, MI is always in the news having to do with something about water. So like, maybe we will have it there? Yeah, that sounds reall…”It seems that McFarland had more to say on the subject but our call was cut short when his federal prison phone account ran out of minutes. In a PR & Press Release written in crayon, and simply signed “King of New York”, it was explained that Fyre Festival 2.0 would feature performances by some interesting talent. Instead of promising anyone specific, the release simply stated that anyone the ticket holder wants to play “will absolutely show up”. The press release then devolved into ad hominem acts against 50 Cent. This is still a developing story, so stay tuned to EDM Sauce for more. Happy April 1, everyone.",articles9,"['EDM Documentary', 'Ja Rule']"
"After a wild ride of a first edition at its new location, Ultra Music Festival can officially call Virginia Key its home for the next year. The festival, which only had four months to plan for its new location, went off widely without a hitch. There were issues with transportation to and from the venue, specifically when traffic on the causeway leading to the island was shut down, forcing attendees to walk back to the mainland one night. While this was not the best look for Ultra, a 2 mile walk caused by issues out of the festival's control is not the end of the world. It is also important to remember that this is one of the largest music festivals in the world, and was produced in under 120 days. Marketing and New Media director of Ultra, Albert Berdellans echoed this belief in a recent tweet, which can be found below. Regardless of the hiccups of its initial edition on the island, fans were pleased with the festival across the board. Berdellans also explained that Ultra 2020 will take place on the island next year. If UMF could produce something this incredible in 4 short months, imagine what they can do with a full year…pretty tired and will have more complete thoughts on  later this week so I’ll just say this—it was an unbelievable festival with only 4 months of planningwith a full year to plan,  Miami in Virginia Key will be life-changing— Albert Berdellans (@EDMsnob) ",articles9,['…']

"Ultra Music Festival is still a memory glowing bright in the back of our heads. The festival ended not even 24 hours ago, but the experts over at 1001 Tracklists are already hard at work idenitfying every song from every single set. One of the most exciting moments from Day 1, was Tiesto's powerhouse of a mainstage set. The dance music legend took to the stage and immediately made it known that he meant business. Early on in his set, Tiesto dropped a new collaboration with Shaun Frank, which is still unreleased. Lucky for you, we have pinpointed the moment in the set when the madness begins.

"After over of a year of planning, and weeks of negative rumors, the 50th-anniversary celebration of Woodstock, set to take place this August in Watkins Glen, New York has been canceled. The festival confirmed that it would not be taking place in an official statement released to  which reads, “It’s a dream for agencies to work with iconic brands and to be associated with meaningful movements. We have a strong history of producing experiences that bring people together around common interests and causes which is why we chose to be a part of the Woodstock 50th Anniversary Festival.  But despite our tremendous investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the artists, partners, and attendees.”The cancelation comes after rumors of trouble brewing two weeks ago when ticket sales were delayed. This normally is a red flag for performing artists, as it indicates an issue exists with investors. The Black Keys also announced they would not be performing the festival which only added fuel to the rumor fire. At the end of the day, while it is unfortunate the event will not take place, it is for everyone's best interest that organizers do not try to throw something together which cannot live up to the standards of safety that it should.

Blanke has been killing the game with all of his recent  and this one lives up to his standard.This new track fits in perfectly with ATLiens current “Space Cult” tour theme. “Contact” is a dark and heavy track that lives up to each artists signature dark sound. Full of heavy basslines and stunning drops, “Contact” is not for the lighthearted. If an alien invasion were to happen, this track would definitely be playing.About halfway through the track, ATLiens and Blanke have added in some of the most intense drops I have ever heard in my life. It's not something you can prepare for but definitely adds to the feel of the track. All in all, ATLiens and Blanke have killed it in this collaboration and we can't wait to see what they have coming in the future.",articles9,[None]

While it's not a completely new track, we're happy for anything from the legendary group. The new version of “One” will be debuted at the tele2 Arena in Stockholm during Swedish House Mafia's performance on May 2nd.We're sure that the trio has more new music in the works under their recording deal with Columbia Records.

The DJ went to Twitter to announce the show postpones and then later updated fans on the exact reason for the cancelations.Illenium's girlfriend's health issue put her in the hospital for five days, so we can see why he would want to be there by her side.In his Twitter statements, he let fans know that refunds would be issues and that the shows will be rescheduled as soon as possible.Due to unforeseen circumstances unfortunately I need to postpone my upcoming performances in London, Cologne, and Haag.

"DJ Snake has been working tirelessly to bring his production skills into all realms of popular music. Getting his start firmly in dance and electronic the French Music Mastering For The Music Industry | EDM Sauce has recently branched out with collaborations with Justin Bieber, Cardi B, and now a host of modern-day rap superstars. In his latest release DJ Snake dives head first into modern day rap. Laying down verses on top of his beat are Offset, 21 Savage, Sheck Wes, and Gucci Mane. To say that this is a monster lineup is selling it short. ‘Enzo' is a brutal and intense track that falls right into rhythm with what is destroying modern day Charts. While it might be a bit early to tell, we have to imagine that you will be hearing this single all over the radio in no time at all. Check it out below.  ",articles9,['DJ Snake']
"This past week, massive waves were made when Fall Out Boy, Macklemore, and Martin Garrix all shared the same photo with the same caption. It was reported pretty quickly that the gang of Charts-topping artists was working on a project together. Nobody expected it to drop only a few days later. Today, Garrix, Macklemore and Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy released what will undoubtedly be a summer megahit, a single called ‘Summer Days'. The track is about what you would expect. It blends the styles of the collaborators together perfectly. This makes it instantly accessible to a very wide audience. While it might not make Martin Garrix super fans roll over in excitement, there is a lot of good to find in this unexpected collaboration.

"There are few artists' that can match the caliber and musical ingenuity than that of Sam Gellaitry. He is able to create alluring, beautiful and moving pieces of electronic music in a seemingly routine fashion. There is no doubt that he is full of talent and with all of his recent releases over the past couple years it is clear to see why this producer has been making so much noise.On Friday, April 26th, Sam Gellaitry will be performing for the first time in the Kings Hall at Avant Gardner in Brooklyn, NY. If you haven't seen him live before then this is the time to finally do it, this show is sure to be a magical event complete with everything an electronic music fan could ask for. He's an act that surely never disappoints and we cannot wait to see what he has in store for us at this amazing venue here in NYC.

"Coachella finally wrapped up its 2019 edition last night. The festival wrapped up its second weekend with a performance by Ariana Grande. That being said, a simple Ariana Grande performance would not be enough to send off Coachella in style. After all, if Coachella is known for one thing – it is special guests. Ariana Grande shocked the crowd by bringing out Justin Bieber to perform his hit song ‘Sorry'. While the appearance seemed a bit random, the fact that the pair share a manager helps lend some semblance of coherence to the performance. What cannot be excused throughout is how obvious Bieber's lip Sync was throughout his song. This was Ashley Simpson on SNL level rough. Many times the vocalist can be seen with the mic down by his waist while lyrics continue to be pumped out. While fans were excited none the less, we have to say this won't go down in history as one of Coachella's finer moments. Which is unfortunate as the rest of Grande's set was seriously impressive. The vocalist and songwriter is the youngest female headliner in the history of Coachella. Check out the clip below courtesy of TMZ.

"GESAFFELSTEIN is back and arguably better than ever folks. After the release of his most recent Albums and an astounding performance across both weekends at Coachella, the French industrial maestro is demonstrating that after a few years of silence, he still has mountains left to offer the electronic music scene. While his harsh, intense sound has been replicated in ways by the movement of midtempo artists such as REZZ and Deathpact, GESAFFELSTEIN still knows how to bring unique production elements that are both unexpected and immaculate. Today he has released a 10 date (9 date if you do not count Governor's Ball) tour across the US, beginning this fall. Want to see GESAFFELSTEIN live?

"It is about time folks. After over a year of writing about the new rumors around Skrillex's upcoming body of work. The man himself has acknowledged that something is underway. In a series of tweets this weekend, Skrillex touched on the fact that rumors have been flying for quite a while now. He has been tirelessly working on himself as well as helping his friends as a producer, but all that is about to change. Speaking vaguely, Skrillex told the public that it was time for him to once again focus on his own music, and do so with total concentration. After a few releases such as his collaborations with Joyryde and Boyz Noise, we are incredibly excited to hear that Skrillex will soon be dropping some personal work. It has been quite a long time coming but it appears the king is ready to take back his throne. Been taking long time off working on my friends Albums but more importantly myself. Been lots of rumors of an “Albums”. I don’t know what it is or what to call it….— Skrillex (@Skrillex) But I’m about to start putting in this new work , going full speed ahead , no turning back— Skrillex (@Skrillex) But this is just the warm up— Skrillex (@Skrillex) ",articles9,"['Joyryde', 'Boyz Noise', 'Albums']"
"There is a good reason as to why Austin City Limits is consistently ranked as one of the countries top music festivals. Every single year the festival improves. The grounds are expanded, the layout is modified, and of course, the lineup consistently grows to include more top tier acts than anyone thought possible. Last year, in my review of the 2018 edition of ACL, I noted how good of a job Austin City Limits does including all generations and genres of music. It is a family-friendly festival that does not trade any of its high-end appeals to be more demographically inclusive. It is hard to put into words what makes ACL so special. It is an event everyone who loves the festival circuit absolutely must attend at least once. If you have not had the pleasure of hitting Austin for the festival, 2019 serves as the perfect opportunity. This year ACL has pulled down some of the most renowned acts in the world. Headliners include Guns'n'Roses, Mumford & Sons, The Cure, Childish Gambino, Cardi B, Billie Eilish, and Tame Impala.The lineup's depth really is demonstrated when the undercard starts. Grammy award winner Kacey Musgraves will take to the stage as well as Charts-topping artists such as 21 Savage, Lil Uzi Vert, and James Blake. I am sure you are asking what about the EDM? This is an EDM website after all…Have no fear, ACL has enough high caliber acts to satiate even the most demanding of pallets. Griz, RL Grime, FISHER, Hippy Sabotage, Jai Wolf and Troyboi are just some of the noteworthy EDM acts to grace this lineup. Tickets for ACL are on sale and moving FAST. This is the kind of festival where both weekends will sell out, so do not delay. . We'll see you down in Austin this year, for another showstopping edition of America's finest festival.

"If you're a fan of Bass Music then I can almost guarantee that you've heard of a little festival called Lost Lands. I, along with the many other people who have attended this event, can definitely agree on the fact that it is truly a spectacle unlike any other. It is complete with almost everything a bass music fan could ask for filled with unimaginable attractions, huge production and the heaviest of bass. The full lineup for this years event was just recently announced and believe me when I say that it is seriously huge. The lineup includes both big names and small featuring the likes of some well known artists such as Eprom, Ekali, 12th Planet and Zeds Dead while also including some fast rising stars in the scene such as Phase One, Whipped Cream, YOOKiE and Shadient. It is set to be an extravaganza unlike anything we have seen in the past, with everything involved it seems like this festival only gets better year after year.

"One of the most exciting storylines to break last year was the creation of a 50th-anniversary festival to honor Woodstock. Soon details began to drip out. The festival would be hosted at Watkins Glen, NY. It would feature many prominent artists across many genres and generations of music. It would be a three-day camping event. It all sounded pretty incredible. Then the line up dropped. Immediately, fans had some mixed reactions, but overall the public was pleased. Then things went dark for a little bit, until this weekend when it was announced through a PR & Press Release that ticket sales would be delayed. They were expected to begin today. Billboard spoke with an anonymous source who works with one of the booked artists who explained that there is a lack of communication from organizers that is worrisome. It is known that most artists have been paid deposits for the event already. The ticket on-sale date being pushed back is not the end of the festivals worries either. One of the headlining artists has already pulled out. Fans who were looking forward to seeing The Black Keys at Woodstock should start to look for other events hosting the group. The Black Keys only gave a vague explanation for their decision to not play the festival, at this time we are not sure if it is related to internal struggles which have been reported. Is Woodstock 2019 heading towards cancelation? No firm answer can be given just yet, although there are some troublesome signs. Stay tuned as more information becomes available.

"What's going on Dance Music Fans?! We hope you are having a kick ass start to the festival season. As you know, we love bringing you our weekly Artist of the Week series, showing you the best in the up and coming dance music world. Today, we are bringing back a REPEAT, yes, a REPEAT Artist of the Week (they're that damn good) to our series. Please help me welcome back, Booyah Riot to our featured Artist!The group’s sixth original release is truly eargasmic. Channeling pop and deep house vibes, Booyah Riot’s “Don’t Waste My Time” is food for soul for anyone that feels their relationship is stuck.““Our newest release was really about us continuing to learn and grow as artists, trying different genres, vibes. Whatever we feel like doing at the moment. Don’t Waste My Time was something we have all felt at one point in a relationship, so we hope other’s feel it too”This lyric-focused track shows a softer side of this Miami-based DJ/Producer trio. It describes a woman that is confronting her partner about their level of commitment: “Take it or leave it, man up and make your move”.Soft strings lead in with crisp vocals that move the song forward. Once the track drops, electronic, pop and deep house elements come together to deliver a groovy feel good vibe.Though they have only been working together for a couple of years, Gio, Kong, and Wilemind have been making waves throughout many EDM circles. Previous releases, “2AM” reached #11 on the Billboard Dance Charts and their remix of “Macy Gray’s – “I Try” was featured on EDM Sauce, By The Wavs, and Rave Rafting, to name a few.We got an awesome chance to sit down with the trio again to ask them more about their creative process and where they delve their inspiration from:“Ideas come to us very randomly…anytime, anywhere. If at least 2/3 of us feel it, we run with it. Sometimes it begins with a melody, sometimes with a concept, other times with a just a lyric.”As for 2019, Booyah Riot is hoping to make a massive splashdown this Summer in the Festival Circuit:“We had a great 2018, playing amazing gigs like XS, Lavo and Encore Beach Club as well as some amazing events like Mad Decent and No Sugar Added. In 2019, we hope to match or surpass our #11 Billboard Dance Charts single “2AM” and looking to start touring…we don’t know how that works lol…so hopefully we meet someone that does soon. We love performing, we can’t wait to play our first festival, so that’s on the top of our list!”Be sure to checkout Booyah Riot on their socials @BooyahRiot.Great hanging out with you.

Lightning In A Bottle will also be moving away from the San Antonio Recreation Area in Bradley, California which they previously called home and will be moving the party to Bakersfield, California at the Buena Vista Aquatic Recreational Area.One thing that is guaranteed not to change, is Lightning In A Bottle's ongoing multi genre  stellar line up.

"Sure are a lot of butters out on the market these days. Of course there’s peanut — smooth not chunky, don’t be rude — but then you’ve got almond, sunflower, hazlenut, hemp, and that’s barely even scratching the surface! There’s a new kind of butter on the come-up though: Montreal-based three-piece artisanal kitchen Lungbutter, whose debut full-length  is due out next month via Constellation Records.If you prefer your butter to be super sludgy, like so thick you’ll need to hire a European strongman to stir all that oil around, then Lungbutter is right up your alley. It’s the kind of butter that’ll  stick to the roof of your mouth. Though only a three-piece, Lungbutter project an onslaught of sound far greater than just guitar, drums, and vocals. Mashing scuzzy riffs, pummeling drums, and speak-sing vocals, they conjure up a dynamic that falls somewhere on the ragged line between The Melvins and Life Without Buildings.Try and stir the sludge around for yourself by listening to “Flat White” off of Lungbutter’s  down below.

"Everything old is new again…except radio, which seems to occupy this weird space that’s simultaneously old as hell in technological terms and tremendously resistant to being totally replaced. Although the Buggles were  about “video kill[ing] the radio star” back in 1979, they neglected to acknowledge the extent to which people post-millennium  value both nostalgia and the inseparable nature of cars and station surfing. Like that comforting childhood “blankee” that we still can’t bring ourselves to get rid of, radio remains — and yet a lot of us still have a fuzzy feeling about it!Those who came of age during the 60s in 70s might know the feeling better than most.

"Like your sweaty legs on a summer day in Queensland, Aussie pals stick together! Or at least, that’s been James Rushford’s inclination since before the Melbourne native completed his PhD in Music at the renowned CalArts, as he had already collaborated with a number of experimentally-minded, Australian musicians. Rushford’s resume  includes work with such renowned artists/institutions as Michael Pisaro and the Krakow Sinfonietta, but when it comes to formal releases that have been propagated in physical or digital form, his Australian compatriots have tended to share the credits in some fashion. Joe Talia  for his initial albums (including one on Graham Lambkin’s Kye imprint), while subsequent to the release of those, Rushford has worked with Crys Cole (as Ora Clementi), Frances Plagne, Oren Ambarchi, and . Jaeger’s not actually Australian, but I hear the Parisian insists on a floor-to-ceiling cabinet dedicated to Tim Tams.The point is: collaborations have been an admirable tendency for Rushford, which might explain his just-announced new album for Oren Ambarchi’s Black Truffle label. The Aussie connection persists, but  is otherwise the first release where Rushford took total control of the process — and where his name isn’t adjacent to someone else’s on the cover. Rushford composed, performed, and recorded by himself; and the roughly 30-minute release ultimately amounts to an electroacoustic effort in “claustrophobia.” Field recordings and a borderline ridiculous array of instruments all help to push the walls inward.

"Australian electronic composer and lover of all things the color blue  has released a remix of the Warsaw-based cellist and  Resina’s “In In,” which is part of a larger remix album due out on May 31 via 130701, the label that kickstarted Max Richter and Johann Johannsson’s early careers. Originally a twinkling track built around a simple floor tom rhythm off Resina’s 2018 release , Frost’s remix of “In In” marries his industrious kicks and spacious, filtered synths with Resina’s crystalline strings, resulting in an uncomfortable matrimony you can’t help but gawk at. It unfolds when there are seemingly no creases left to unravel, and revives itself when you think it’s gone. Frost’s remix is premiering here today.

"One third of the beloved alt-rock stalwarts , singer and multi-instrumentalist Kazu Makino, has announced her very first solo album. The LP, titled  and released as KAZU, will be out later this year. Makino has also just shared a video for the first single off the album, “Salty.” It was directed by Paride Ambrogi and filmed on Italy’s Elba Island, where the artist has resided over the last several months. The Tuscan coastline has been an important source of inspiration for Makino, who found herself isolated enough to “put part of her personal history behind her, in search of a new perspective that would allow her to rediscover herself.” Not surprisingly, the wistful, aquatic techno-pop of “Salty” sounds a far cry from anything Blonde Redhead’s gotten us used to.   will be released via Makino’s own imprint of the same name, and distributed by !K7. The LP’s is going to boast contributions from Ryuichi Sakamoto, Mauro Refosco (Atoms for Peace, Red Hot Chili Peppers, David Byrne), and Ian Chang (Son Lux, Landlady).

"In a  with us, in which his chillness was fully on display and made a jealous man out of a prime Keanu Reeves, M. Geddes Gengras gave credence to the theory that his place in East LA is literally overflowing with music in every possible sense. His dogs at the time were seemingly fully accustomed to the regular and persistent cacophony, patch cables were frequently mistaken for a brand new type of pasta coming straight out of Italy, and when it comes to what the modular synth enthusiast had up his sleeve in terms of electronic explorations, he remarked on his ability to let things flow long enough that a “20-hour-long record” might just spontaneously materialize. Gengras’s recent album  ended up enveloping for a still-ridiculous 2.5 hours, leaving somebody crying “uncle!” as a result. (That person is probably the Grinch reincarnated.)For those of us who aren’t the Grinch reincarnated,  is the next wandering endeavor that promises to open the spaceship door rather than leave us on this turbulent and occasionally depressing Earth. The album is out May 19 via cassette and digital courtesy of the Hausu Mountain imprint, and musically, it’s 80 minutes of Gengras inadvertently polishing his professional reputation. Certainly, one could call on him in the event of synth zombie attack, where only those who speak LFO are able to protect and save the human race.Pre-orders for the album are .

Hailing from Haifa, the pair formed in 2018 but have already gone global, performing across the Middle East, Paris, Berlin, London, Amsterdam, South Korea, and Brazil (come to the United States sometime soon, mmmk?).With an EP available *exclusively* below for streaming ahead of its April 12 drop, it’s easy to discern why Zenobia is at the  of the Palestinian club scene (and some might say, part of the “” sound). Wild opener “KSR KSR KSR” deploys those deliciously intoxicating dabke synth leads cranked up to their sweaty, unrelenting extreme. “La Fou - Up” shows that the duo can write a slower jam as well as a banger, while “Tawahan,” a dabke-dub mix, is a joyous closer.Zenobia are working on an album currently, but for now, listen to their debut EP down below and pre-order it : EP tracklisting:01.

"Raves are the endurance tests of electronic music. The blistering kick drums, the pulsating, detuned sawtooths, the disorienting smoke-filled rooms, the cuddle puddles…makes it all worth it when you emerge into the daylight of morning (or *gulp* early afternoon), and see the rest of humanity acting like responsible people.Bogdan Raczynski brings us all the way back to the Wild Rave West with eighteen jittery, never-released tracks culled from his 90’s archives.

"After going a bit mild on last year’s ballad-heavy , the Titus Andronicus pendulum seems to have swung back in the other direction. Because on  — their sixth album out in June via Merge Records — Titus Andronicus are fixin’ to go a bit , baby! Shit. Well anyway, for the  iteration of Titus Andronicus, the band was staffed by Liam Betson, R.J. Gordon, Chris Wilson, and, of course, Patrick Stickles. Trimmed down to a lean four-piece, and without the assistance of any outside musicians (save for some backing vocals) or studio bells and whistles, the band set out to capture the energy of their live shows. Now, this may make the album sound like it’s “back to basics,” or “a return to their roots.”  refer to it as such. As the very wordy press release announcing this album’s existence explains, “This is not a return to the band’s roots — this is an excavation of the dirt beneath those roots which will leave no fingernail unsoiled for the band or its audience.”  also marks a first in the Titus Andronicus catalog, as it is their first album  recorded with Kevin McMahon at Marcata Recording in Upstate New York. Instead, the perennial east coast outfit traveled out Midwest to record at Steve Albini’s Chicago studio, under the producing tutelage of the one-and-only Bob Mould. Hear what a cross-generational punk team up between Titus Andronicus and Bob Mould sounds like by listening to “(I Blame) Society” off of  down below.

"If you’re living in a city, I really only see two possible avenues for music production. The first option is to create something that runs parallel to the noisy and frenetic explanation for why jackhammers and accented cursing are the sounds that backdrop both your dreams and your nightmares. The second (and ) option is to create something that foils the urban chaos by imposing an objective calm, which, point of fact, is more reminiscent of a desolate landscape than it is streets teeming with traffic and bodies and conspicuous wet spots on otherwise dry sidewalks. The latter approach serves to relieve, ultimately; and relief was partially the goal that Jacob Long a.k.a. Earthen Sea had in mind when he was in the process of making his new album on Kranky. “In response to living in a fairly hectic city, and at a very hectic time for the world at large, creating something more drawn back and restrained felt appropriate,” he says.Earthen Sea’s prior album  felt pretty restrained itself, but this newest one stops short of being something to which a person could even tap their increasingly nebulous foot. You occasionally think that a track’s gonna evolve into a sub-straining display of dub techno, but instead listeners can expect to be pleasantly displaced from all manner of activity. By way of example, check out “Existing Closer Or Deeper In Space” down below. I’ll leave it to the native New Yorkers to opine on the  activities from which they and Long would like to be displaced.  is out June 7 on Kranky, and you can pre-order it . tracklisting:01.

"As the old saying goes: every artist needs a home. And when you’re an artist with the tireless work ethic, vision, and conviction of, say, a veteran artisan carpenter (for example); it can often be more beneficial to build your own home than to rent out someone else’s. I’m sure this is the exact metaphor that producer Kangding Ray had in mind when he decided to launch his brand new label, ara.So, keeping with this figurative train of thought, let’s talk foundations: “ara is a platform for recording artists with unique sonic identities that seeks to induce deep emotion through sound; focusing on singular artistic endeavours, created with patience and dedication.” In practical terms, the label will focus on “parallel series of curated releases,” each concentrated around a particular musical or conceptual approach. If that doesn’t get your blood pumping like you’re hooked up to some kind of blood pump, try this block of text on for size:Okay, now let’s talk furniture (the logical next step after foundation building): a new EP by Kangding Ray called  will be the label’s first release.

The combined DVD and compilation is far removed from the brain-immolating fuzz-punk the San Franciscan act has churned out in recent years, but this throwback material is just as unearthly thanks to gelatinous reverb and songcraft that’s more suggested than concrete. Each track was recorded and filmed outside of the studio, floating lazily into the bay, forest, or whatever ecosystem the band happened to inhabit.

"Reading about Colin Huebert’s recent struggles with hyperacusis and related anxiety, you might find an easy explanation for why Siskiyou’s last album  had a palpable sense of desperation, which arrived primarily via the low-key vessel of Huebert’s raspy vocals and introspective songwriting. Certainly those health issues had an unintentional thematic effect on the album, as Huebert himself , but if you go back to Siskiyou’s , it’s not like the resultant listener inclination was to get up early in the morning solely for the purposes of waving hello to the springtime songbirds. The music was just as thoughtful back , so really, we should be considering an ode to Huebert for continuing his art despite changes that are more visible behind the scenes. (Seriously, imagine being a drummer or otherwise musician and suddenly developing a debilitating sound sensitivity. Only the passionate would persist!)The recording process for  had to change substantially, and Siskiyou’s new album , out May 17 on , is similarly a reflection of a new creative normal for Huebert. Where Peter Carruthers, Shaunn Watt, and Erik Arnesen (), were formerly all in on the Siskiyou project; it’s been revealed in official press that the new album is essentially a Huebert solo effort.

"Japanese producer Nobuyuki Sakuma has a new album coming out under his CVN moniker. Out in June via Orange Milk,  mixes beat music and abstract electronics in the creation of an ever-mutating album that refuses to be packed into a cohesive style. The track-to-track variance is meant to evoke walking through Tokyo, and how feelings and experiences evolve as the journey continues. Fittingly then, “成分 Seibun” — the album’s lead track and a collaboration with Japanese singer/producer NTsKi — creates this feeling of stepping foot into a nocturnal Tokyo for the first time. That sense of interwoven wonderment, peace, and trepidation you feel before surrendering yourself to the sights and sounds and maybe a smell or two. If Sakuma ever decides he’s going break with his principles of making whatever kind of music fits his mood to get into the world of vocal pop, “成分 Seibun” would be an ideal starting point.Listen to “成分 Seibun” down below, where you can also find the full tracklisting for  as well as Sakuma’s upcoming tour dates.

"There’s a lot of dumb music out there. Music whose entirely value prop is basically getting you not to think. That can be a great thing, but more often it is a very bad thing. Vancouver’s Dumb, on the other hand, make decidedly  music. One could easily call it smart, in fact.

"The next time somebody attempts to argue that the Internet has been a wash or a net negative for the music industry overall, first: stare at them in silence for a deliberately creepy amount of time — and second: kindly point them to reissues of albums like Sachiko Kanenobu’s , which few(er) people would be aware of absent the word of mouth that the World Wide Web so capably enables. The album was originally written, recorded, and released by the 18-year-old Kanenobu in 1972, and as if being sponsored by one of Japan’s first independent labels didn’t keep expectations low  when it came to national or international publicity, the Osaka-born guitarist wasn’t especially enamored by the thought of being arguably the country’s first female singer-songwriter. She met and married music critic Paul Williams, emigrated to the United States, and reportedly left promotion up to the poor saps at Underground Record Club. Kanenobu got back into music after a period of stateside acclimating, but  (which roughly translates to “beautiful sky,” by the way), by virtue of being stylistically unique for the period/country when and where it was released, has garnered a reputation as a hidden gem. It’s received a number of reissues from Japan-based labels since 1995; and now, the Seattle-based Light in the Attic label will be reissuing a deluxe edition of  come June 21. It’ll feature audio remastered from the original analog tapes, and extensive liner notes will offer background on the delicacy that Kanenobu easily delivered way back when.

"Next to that  in  where Tom Cruise’s character morphs into a delivery pizza and says, “you reheat… me” to Renee Zellweger, nothing warms my heart more than seeing electronic pioneers like  and Plaid continue to release music while maintaining a relationship with the label that helped get them started literal decades ago. Like Autechre, Plaid have remained more or less true to the original sound that they respectively propagated in the mid-1990s — and in all that respect, they’re like musical anchors that compel mental stability amid what might otherwise be CHAOS in one’s personal life. I mean, a former high school jock might now be exploring metallurgy in the warehouse of a distant philosopher cousin, until putting on the newest Plaid single triggers nostalgic memories where he or she threw that game-winning pass…uh, well okay, maybe not… is the name of Plaid’s super important 10th(!) album for Warp, and connections abound when you actually consider the molecular connotations behind that title. Andy Turner and Ed Handley thought that the “repetitious strength” and “endurance” of polymers allowed for a good theme; while at the same time, I’ve already alluded to how easily those adjectives apply to the influential duo from London. Synthetic polymers  attest to the computer-based production that Plaid have clearly perfected.Pre-order  ahead of its June 7 release, , and check out the track “Maru” down below, which combines that trademark organic sound with a surprising in-your-faceness: tracklisting:01.

"The term “sprawl” is normally used in a negative connotation, usually in connection to the suburban outgrowth practice “urban sprawl.” Although some planners with vision are trying to shape the landscape for the better, negotiating city expansion with care and responsibility for the environment, wildlife, farm life, traffic, and health/social impacts, they are few, and the tendency for more and more out-city development is mostly seen as a detrimental inevitability and a meandering mess.When it comes to music, though, “sprawl” has more positive over-and-undertones. Many of the beloved artists featured regularly on this site are masters of gorgeous sprawling pieces (and strong meandering messes) and few do it better than Hudson Valley, NY composer/writer/artist , who uses sprawl to his advantage, even in contained shorter tracks. Trecka has recorded with many others and under many guises (Pillars and Tongues, Dark Dark Dark, Drekka) but he will release his first full-length album under his own name on April 26.

"Diskolab hosted the Miami edition of Green Velvet’s La La Land at the Delano on Saturday March 30th. Artists that were included in this carefully curated lineup were: Eskuche, Mihalis Safras, Doorly, Prok | Fitch, Layton Giordani, Sonny Fodera b2b Dom Dolla, Patrick Topping, Gorgon City, and Dajae in addition to the headliner which consisted of the dynamic duo, Green Velvet and Claude Vonstroke. Both headliners are respectively known for being the boss man of their own labels: Relief Records and Dirtybird Records, they are also known to move crowds and keep the dance floors grooving into the night.Known for taking listeners on a journey into “La La Land”, Green Velvet says, “Good vibes, fun and love will surround them as they dance poolside in the sun. Partying in Chicago during the birth of House and given my many years in the House/Rave scene, I want to give my fans an experience that is true to its roots and at the same time filled with life changing surprises. I want my fans to feel transported to a place only experienced in their dreams. I hope to see you soon in…La La Land.”Although this promise was kept to the partygoers inside, partygoers outside felt the complete opposite. Things may not have gone as planned as there was a massive wait time starting at 4pm. I directly made my way to the table on the side to get my credentials and soon after I was told that the venue was at capacity and the fire marshals were inside so they wouldn’t even give me a wristband because it was not guaranteed that I would even make it in L. This brought back memories of last year where the same issue happened. After two hours of trying to be patient and talking to everyone possible, I made it to La La Land.Sonny Fodera was b2b with Dom Dolla who made his Miami debut and definitely did it in style. The crowd went wild when the Biscits Remix of Route 94’s “House and Pressure” dropped. Patrick Topping kept the momentum as he started playing his own “Be Sharp Say Nowt” which set off a round of co2 cannons at the front of the stage during the gospel wails in the song. The Delano during sunset is always a beautiful sight overlooking the beautiful Miami scenery.London producers, Gorgon City stole the show and guided us through an unforgettable journey of their catchiest tunes. “Mumma”-Jacky & Holmes John and the Terrace Dub of “Blame” from their Escape album featuring the vocals of Josh Barry kept us on our feet. Green Velvet’s solo set consisted of Dajae’s vocal elements during tracks like “Deep Dip”. Green Velvet can be found with a celebratory champagne glass at almost every show, even while busting out his signature moves and dropping his stand out collaboration with Prok & Fitch called “Sheeple”. His other collaboration with Eats Everything “Complex” and his big room banger with Chris Lake “Deceiver” made for a stand out show. Once Claude VonStroke joined to match the energy, the vibe at the Delano was unstoppable. I couldn’t give you an answer if you asked me to name a better duo. Playing as their joint alias, “Get Real”, they played tracks like “Walay (My Bae)- Claude VonStroke and “Maae”-Descartes. During the half way point of their highly anticipated b2b, “La La Land” starts playing and Green Velvet gets on the headphone mic to sing the lyrics. The party-centric track goes hand-in-hand with the fun loving vibe at La La Land.The time I spent at La La Land was a time filled with the best house and techno music that kept us on our feet. This was one of the best parties I attended during Miami Music Week. La La Land definitely did not disappoint and I can’t wait to see what Green Velvet does to outdo himself next year.",articles26,"['Prok | Fitch', 'Dom Dolla', 'Patrick Topping', 'Dajae', 'Green Velvet', 'Dom Dolla', 'Pressure', 'The Delano', 'Green Velvet’s', 'Dajae’s', 'Prok & Fitch', 'Green Velvet', 'Green Velvet']"
"Receiving another memorable airing in Garrix’s Ultra Miami set, where Seth Hills also jumped on stage during the STMPD RCRDS stage set, ‘Echo’ is finally ready to be unleashed on the world for all to enjoy and use for dancefloor destruction.Brooding atmospheric layers, gnarly bass and filtered acidic synths conjure a dark mood in the intro that gives a nod of what’s to come. Chattering snare rolls lift us to the drop, where a minimalist groove stutters away with throbbing sub and snapping, crunchy beats. Brief vocal cut-ups and more rhythm to the groove, and the stripped-back structure contrasts with the maximalist sound palette. The distorted acid rises in the breaks over on-beat claps and synth risers before the track again builds and slams us back into the manic groove. It’s an exercise in simplicity and subtlety, taking nods from techno as well as electro house.This is the fourth release on STMPD RCRDS for Seth Hills after the massive Julian Jordan collab ‘Backfire’. This new jam is set to propel this young talent into exciting new reaches.",articles26,[None]
"                                                                   Miami was ready to go DEEP and apparently so was Oliver Heldens at his Heldeep After Dark party which took place at The Florida Room in the Delano Hotel on Thursday, March 28th during Miami Music Week. The party never stopped from the second it started. Oliver put together an amazing lineup of Hook N Sling, Niko The Kid, Carta, and Anna Lunoe in addition to himself. Oliver ended up randomly popping at so many different parties this week including Kaskade & Friends and Shaq’s Fun House (where he went b2b with the legendary Armin Van Burren) but this being his first official headlining party, he came ready to show us what he got.The stunning Florida Room is an intimate setting by its size which gave the feeling of an underground illegal party in Europe. Illuminated by faint purple lighting, you are brought straight into the dancefloor after following a short corridor. Beautiful neon writing behind the DJ booth read “I’m never gonna dance again, the way I danced with you…” And what a true
statement that was.My feet did not stop moving until the night sadly came to an end. I arrived around 1am, and already there was commotion at the front door of fans trying to get into the venue. Anna Lunoe had the club going crazy with Will Clarke & Nick Monaco’s highly addictive track “Like A Girl”. Oliver arrived at around 2:15am and shared a short unexpected b2b with Lunoe until it was time for his headlining slot.For the next two hours, we were taken through a journey full of house, techno, bass and everything in between. One of the things I love more about an Oliver Heldens show in an intimate setting is that you really have no idea what he’s going to play and where the night is going to go. Some fan favorites like “Gecko (Overdrive)” “Men On Mars, “WTF,” and popular remixes of his such as “One Kiss” and “Le Freak” set off the crowd into a roar and was a great way to get the dancefloor on side. One of the most memorable moments throughout the night was when he started to showcase his techno side by playing “Astral Projection” by Enrico Sangiuliano which we learned on Sunday of Ultra Music Festival to be one of the highlights from his mainstage set. You can listen to the entire set here:4 am came and the night had come to an end but we were in for one more treat as
him and Carta ended up going back to back and brought out every last bit of energy
the crowd had left. I’ve always said Oliver really knows how to connect with the crowd and this night further proved my statement. As I waited for my Uber outside, I ended up having a brief interaction to let him know how great of a night it was and how I couldn’t wait to see him at Ultra on Sunday. He couldn’t have been sweeter and thanked me for the kind words. Nothing I love more than a DJ that has the same love and adoration for their fans. ",articles26,"['DEEP', 'Oliver Heldens', 'Thursday', 'Hook N Sling', 'Niko The Kid', 'Anna Lunoe', 'Shaq’s Fun House (', '…', 'Nick Monaco’s', 'Oliver Heldens', 'Enrico Sangiuliano']"
"ANTS Ibiza took over the Miami Music Week 2019 closing party at the National Hotel and what an unforgettable experience that was. Having been to an ANTS party in Ibiza and at BPM Festival in Mexico, I was excited to learn that for the first time it was being held in Miami during Miami Music Week. Aside from the endless parties happening on that Wednesday to Sunday, it is also an important week for artists to test out new music and network with other people in the music industry.The National Hotel is one of the most popular venues for pool parties to be held during this busy week. Check-in was seamless and the décor inside and outside of the hotel leading to the stage area is 5 star. Upon heading into the pool area, one of the first things I noticed was the unique layout of the party. The dancefloor area was sand adding to the beachy vibe.This year’s lineup consisted of all back to back sets. We arrived in time to catch the ending of Lauren Lane b2b Martin Buttrich. Their tracks, both deep and heavy, set the right mood for the afternoon. Even though it was still day time, the music made it feel like we were in a dark club. The atmosphere at the National was great and even with the crowd, there was still plenty of space to let loose and dance comfortably. Tiga b2b Davide Squillace kept the groove by playing tracks like “Multiply”- Skin on Skin, “Say Something”-Nasser Baker, and Blessed (Dirty Mix)-Tiga & Martinez Brothers.Adding to our viewing pleasure, there were professional ANTS’ dancers and co2 cannons that would go off every now and then covering the entire crowd during the build-up of a song. Steve Lawler did not disappoint with the big bass that rocked the crowd. He held his own and united the crowd when he played “I lost you”-Electronic Youth, Emeskay and “Music is the Answer”-Mike Vale.Towards the end of the night, I got word that Dennis Ferrer would not be making it to the show due to a back injury. Best wishes to him for a speedy recovery. As a huge fan, I was bummed but the show must go on. After Steve Lawler finished his solo set, Matthias Tanzmann joined for an unexpected b2b set to finish off the night.“Be sharp, say nowt”- Patrick Topping is what really did it for me. The gospel wails with crowd noises, a fat kick drum and synths, combine this track as one of the biggest bombs since its’ release in 2017. “Black Strobe”- Alexander Aurel was another crowd pleaser.ANTS is a party for people who are looking to truly DANCE and for people who don’t care about the mainstream house. Along with this carefully curated lineup, Miami is a great setting and the National Hotel provided an amazing sound system. ANTS is one hell of a party and worth the money spent if they are ever in your city.",articles26,"['Ibiza', 'ANTS', 'Ibiza', 'Aside', 'Martin Buttrich', 'Blessed (', 'Youth', 'Emeskay', 'Dennis Ferrer', 'Matthias Tanzmann', 'ANTS', 'ANTS']"
"AMSTERDAM, April 19, 2019 – Coming off of a phenomenal year both as a producer and on the live front, Rodg is known worldwide for making every minute count for himself and for his fans. As one who’s always looking to explore the farthest reaches of his own sound and the Progressive scene, he never fails to magnify the magic, ensuring that everyone gets to be high on life if only for a fleeting moment. Now, all of that comes together in his second artist album with an experimental touch: ‘Fate’.Listen to Rodg – FateCovering a wide range of captivating music that runs from deep Progressive to Trance to the wonderfully experimental stuff in between, ‘Fate’ is the culmination of every adventure Rodg committed himself to, every decision he’s made and every turn he’s taken throughout his increasingly impressive sonic journey. Featuring no less than eighteen mesmeric records that build toward the inevitable, yet undetermined ending we call ‘Fate’, the album juggles straightforward impressions and idyllic depictions with quirky hooks that unite people in their own way.Rodg: “I always thought of ‘Fate’ as something that life leads you to, no matter what you do or happens to you, whether good or bad, wonderful or stupid. So, in a way, life led me to writing this album. Though it’s different from what I’ve done in the past, I think it ties in even better with the music I play in my DJ sets. It’s more experimental than any album I’ve done before, and I hope that will lead to some more amazing memories and experiences in return.",articles26,['Fate’']

"We all have those moments we love to think back to, those happy times we shared with our friends and tell stories about. Norwegian dance music star Ørjan Nilsen had some old memories and favorite moments of his own to share and he does so with a brand-new release called ‘Reminiscence’, which is already touted as the indirect follow-up to one of his biggest hits to date, ‘Between The Rays’.Listen to Ørjan Nilsen – ReminiscenceA sublime track released on his own turf (In My Opinion), Ørjan Nilsen’s ‘Reminiscence’ marks the return of his classic signature sound. From the tempestuous basslines and emotive vocals to one of those brilliant signature melodies, ‘Reminiscence’ is a trip down memory lane ready to excite legions of fans today.Ørjan Nilsen: “It’s no secret that Trance has always been a huge part of my life and I figured it would be nice to reminisce about the good old times, back to the early ‘2000s era and my first ASOT shows. That’s exactly what ‘Reminiscence’ is about. It’s a combination of a lot of new techniques and ways of making music that I have developed in the past 10+ years and putting something into it that ties into the old sound I am known for. I truly believe this is an improved old-school Ørjan Nilsen piece of work and I hope it will bring some good memories to everyone.”In support of the release of ‘Reminiscence’, Ørjan Nilsen will ask his fans to share some of their stories with him as a way of reliving those wonderful moments. Additionally, the In My Opinion label boss will record a special live set on Facebook Live to play some of his favorite classics to set the mood for some musically inspired reminiscing.Catch Ørjan Nilsen at Marquee NYC this Saturday April 27th 2019 along with Gianluca Vacchi – Get your tickets here: BUY TICKETS",articles26,"['Ørjan Nilsen', 'Ørjan Nilsen’s', 'Reminiscence’', 'Reminiscence’', 'Reminiscence’', 'Ørjan Nilsen']"

"There’s always that one big event that we look forward to every year right before our annual trip to Miami every March. Although Miami Music Week revolves around Ultra Music Festival, there are plenty of day and night events that can keep you entertained without having to fork over $500+ on a 3 day ticket. From Wednesday to Sunday, you will spend every waking moment dancing and neglecting your sleep more than ever. You go through a set of emotions of being either hungry, tired, needing a shower, losing your voice and while there is great dance music in every directions you turn, sometimes you just want to Get Lost.Damian Lazarus has taken note of the potential and explored the opportunities to create something memorable during Miami Music Week. Get Lost returned to Lemon City Studios in Miami’s Little River neighborhood on March 30th for a solid 24 hours of dance music where artist and electronic fans alike can come to forget themselves and find the soul in the music. This open-air party with its’ signature bohemian aesthetic of sprawled out couches, art installations, tropical plant decorations, and carefully curated theme stages created such a mood that goes to show how much Lazarus spared no expense.We arrived at around 7 am to catch the ending of the Wizardry opening set. The supernatural trio, Damian Lazarus, DJ Tennis, and DJ Three have brought their afterhours sessions to North America’s temple of underground music for over a decade. The Theia stage located inside one of the small warehouse rooms was the only stage open at the time. We barely made it inside as it was already crowded and humid. The crowd unanimously lit up and roared as soon as the O’Gutta Mix of Kenny Dope’s “Be Your Freak” started playing. The room which was entirely lit up with red lights along with the ambiance turned Lemon City Studios into a mysterious playground to be absorbed in.Having never attended Get Lost, I was curious to venture off to the rest of the venue. We noticed that there were 3 other stages but none of them were opened and were still being set up. We saw a woman selling “Get Lost” inscribed coconuts which I thought was brilliant given how early it was. There was a tented area with people sitting on the floor so I asked my friend if she wanted to chill out for a little. As soon as we walk in, the sound turns on and Desert Hearts starts playing at the Lemuria Stage. I am a huge fan and at the time, I had no idea of the set times so I thought this was fate and it truly made my entire morning.“House, techno, and love” is quite possibly one of my favorite taglines that these boys live by and what I love about this group. Each member has their own physical aesthetic that makes it easy to tell them apart. Top hat wearing leader, Mikey Lion prefers more of the energetic, celebratory house sound, while Marbs is widely known for his very deep, dark, techno oriented selections. Once you add in Lee Reynolds’ whose electric sound and daft personality make for a stand out performance, you get a combination of absolute madness even at 8am. Alberto Ruiz’ remix of Pig & Dan’s “Saturn Storm” really got the crowd going. Unexpectedly, Marbs tested out a collaboration with Rinzen and Evan Casey which is currently untitled.The scene was surreal as the day followed with sights at every turn around the compound. At around 11am, the outside stage, Garden of Eden which was nestled in a corner, had set motion and shook off the morning chill as Doc Martin got on and played into the early afternoon. By this time, more people had arrived but the venue was far more spread out with its new openings than when we first arrived. Get Lost was a perfect reunion to reconnect with friends that I usually don’t get to see in New York. By 2pm, the second outside stage called Mu, had opened and Atish joined the party with his deep melodies and bumpy bass lines. Other memorable acts were, Danny Tenaglia, special guest Black Coffee, Jamie Jones, Guy Gerber, Jonas Rathsman, Cassy, Diplo, Dubfire, and Dennis Ferrer.I always appreciate a thought out venue. For a 24 hour journey, one would expect all of their needs to be taken into consideration in order to stay longer and make the most out of their time. I can surely say that Get Lost fulfilled. It was easy to “get lost” amidst the four unique stages, each with its own vibe, and lineup. This event has quickly been added to my event circuit during Miami Music Week and I cannot wait to come back next year. Thank you to Damian Lazarus and the entire Crosstown Rebels crew for putting on a sick event and taking me out of the UMF fomo.Take a look at more pictures below.

"Listen to the track belowLike the fading landscape of a dream just before you wake up, “Dawnbreaker” is at once beautiful and barely there. As a member of the vocal trio Mountain Man, Alexandra Sauser-Monnig found her lineage within a long history of folk music, stretching back to the traditional American songbook. The title track of her solo debut under the name Daughter of Swords sounds untethered to anything but her own drifting visions, delicate and hazy as it bends through the air.Sauser-Monnig’s fingerpicked guitar is casual and light, and her voice is so soft that, at times, it feels purely textural: a whistling breeze or a hushed flurry of birdsong. When perceptible, her lyrics speak to this ability to shapeshift. Listing a series of stray incarnations and visions, she whispers to herself what sounds like a prayer: “No meaning or no need.” In its serenity, “Dawnbreaker” makes an absence of clarity feel like a blessing, something to savor before it drifts away.",articles4,['Daughter']

"Longtime “Game of Thrones” composer Ramin Djawadi’s score for Sunday’s epic battle episode made its significant presence felt throughout nearly all of its 82 minutes, commanding attention with the same level of ferocity as little Lyanna Mormont. Djawadi came up as a protégé of Oscar winner Hans Zimmer, known for building cues large enough to match massive big-screen spectacles, and the showstopping music cues in the Battle of Winterfell were many: Dany  commanding dragon fire upon the army of wights after the Dothraki were decimated; Melisandre lighting the trenches on fire; the Night King taking flight with Dany and Jon on his tail. The stakes were high, the actual lines of dialogue were low, and the score did much of the heavy lifting.But a good score helps to regulate our adrenaline, offering moments of climax as well as opportunities for us to finally release the breath we didn’t realize we’d been holding during tense sequences. And the challenge in scoring an almost dialogue-free climactic battle sequence is that eventually you’re trying to do the same thing over and over. By the time the requisite “a character you love is about to die” strings floated in as a farewell to Lyanna, barely 40 minutes had passed, and a bunch of other beloved B-team characters still had to go. So what really saved the day here was silence: It made us worried for Arya in the Winterfell library and it heightened tension down in the crypts, where any sound penetrating the stony walls was cause for fear. When Beric and the Hound searched for Arya, the monstrous snarls of the wights were almost all you could hear.In the opening of 2016’s season six finale—the one where Cersei blows up the sept and half of King’s Landing, causing her son to step out of a window and enabling her to step into his tiny shoes as Queen—Djawadi leaned memorably on piano and organs in a piece called “Light of the Seven.” Those sounds were immediately set apart from the sweeping orchestra cues he usually favors; it was ominous, stuttering to life like Jon gasping for air under the crush of bodies in the Battle of the Bastards. The score had a “Kanye prolonging the intro to ‘Runaway’” feel to it, where you catch yourself wanting to hear another note and when it arrives a moment later than you expect, the levels of anxiety and anticipation only mount.Djawadi returned to the keys for “The Night King,” the score to the nine minutes of action this week that began with Sansa and Tyrion silently succumbing to their fate down in the crypts, and ended with Arya leaping soundlessly towards her target in the Godswood. The minutes in between felt endless and overwhelmingly hopeless, and that score served as a preemptive obituary. Jorah went down (RIP, forever in the friendzone); Jaime, Brienne, and Pod somehow didn’t (seems fake but OK); Sam cried; Jon engaged the zombie dragon in a screaming match. The wights finally stopped charging Theon and instead stood still as the Night King and his backing band of White Walkers approached, and Bran’s cloudy eyes snapped back into focus as he capped off Theon’s (ugh) long redemption arc.It was a beautiful extended moment, with that piano score creating a psychic link to the carnage of “Light of the Seven.” It prepared us to say goodbye, but the inverse occurred; the ruler went down while the masses—at least most of those high up on the episode’s call-sheet—stayed standing. Djawadi lit his flaming arrow, let it shudder for a  minute, suspended in a state of stress, before letting it loose with perfect aim. Like Cersei’s impending threat, the score was invisible but impossible to ignore.",articles4,"['Ramin Djawadi’s', 'Sunday’s', 'Djawadi', 'Arya', 'Hound', 'Arya', 'Queen—Djawadi', 'Seven', 'Djawadi', 'Sansa', 'Tyrion', 'Arya', 'Theon', 'Night King', 'Bran’s', 'Theon’s']"

"Nearly 20 years after the release of , the name D’Angelo still inspires lurid fantasies. The cover of the R&B singer’s iconic sophomore album and its matching video for “Untitled (How Does It Feel),” in which he’s shown in all his sculpted glory, certainly shaped D’Angelo’s image at the time. The clip catered to female desire: His pajama bottoms were just out of frame, creating the illusion that he was standing naked in front of you, showering you (and only you) with all of his attention. It was the launching point for “D’Angelo, sex god” in the wider mainstream—a reputation that, at least based on audience reactions during Saturday’s premiere of , remains very much intact. Wolf whistles, moans, and women yelling “thank you Jesus!” could be heard throughout the Tribeca Film Festival screening of the documentary, even as it detailed just how uncomfortable this had made the introverted, church-raised D’Angelo.Shortly after the tour for his platinum-selling , D’Angelo virtually disappeared from the public eye. He returned 14 years later with , his surprise third album. What happened in between has been speculated on endlessly, thanks to his multiple arrests (for assaulting a woman at a gas station, marijuana possession, carrying a concealed weapon, driving under the influence, and soliciting an undercover cop for sex), his time in rehab, and his generally reclusive personality.  doesn’t necessarily reveal more about those private years, but it does offer rare candid moments with D’Angelo regarding them. That he struggled with alcohol and drug abuse back then is well known by this point, but to hear it from the man himself—that he reached such a low point, he was incapable of making music—is especially heartbreaking.The director, Dutch filmmaker Carine Bijlsma, said during the post-film Q&A that she got the idea for  around 2010, while wondering (like so many of us) what had happened to D’Angelo. After tracking down the email of his collaborator Kendra Foster and proposing the project, Bijlsma was eventually invited on his 2015 Second Coming tour and filmed the footage herself over the course of two years. It’s quite possible D’Angelo would’ve clammed up around a bigger camera crew, but with just Bijlsma trailing him, he seems surprisingly at ease being himself in the film.It’s an interesting dynamic, considering  puts D’Angelo under the gaze of a female filmmaker when it was the female gaze that D’Angelo grappled with before his reclusion. The son of a Pentecostal preacher, D’Angelo grew up in a Virginia church where secular music had the power to scandalize. If he sought liberation by singing about making women wet between the thighs, he ultimately felt just as trapped by it. When he debuted in 1995 with , the 21-year-old was praised for his genre-shifting, well-beyond-his-years musicianship, but by the  tour, he could hardly get through a song without women yelling at him to take off his shirt. This created a chasm between D’Angelo the musician and D’Angelo the celebrity, with the singer experiencing residual guilt from his religious upbringing due to his sex-symbol status. In the film, Questlove says that D’Angelo also suffered from the kind of survivor’s guilt that often plagues black geniuses. He was gifted with a soul-penetrating voice and an unconventional sense of compositional arrangement, but it was the fame part of his career that tripped him up.Bijlsma’s camera eschews objectification. It is not leering, worshipping, or even judging. It is sympathetic of a man who was not emotionally equipped for the kind of spotlight he was thrown into. As a documentary, it’s fairly standard. The talking-head interviews—mostly with Questlove and D’Angelo’s tour manager Alan Leeds, who also executive-produced the doc—are a little too repetitive about D’Angelo being this elusive, introverted man (which is like stating that water is wet). When Bijlsma catches intimate glimpses of him, like when he’s excitedly jamming before a show, that’s when  feels enlightening. It may leave you wanting more of D’Angelo, though—a familiar sentiment.Though his comeback was met with overwhelming acclaim,  illuminates the anxiety and insecurity that still clouds the singer’s mind. Backstage after a show in 2015, D’Angelo’s manager reads aloud just few positive reactions from social media. D’Angelo, in quiet disbelief, responds, “That was from tonight?” It is endearing, and a bit heartrending as well. D’Angelo’s still haunted by his demons, but he’s in a good place now—specifically, the studio. The documentary ends with the news that he’s currently working on his fourth album. No word on the expected wait.",articles4,"['D’Angelo', 'D’Angelo’s', 'Bijlsma’s', 'D’Angelo’s']"

"A timeline of the mess that the 50th anniversary music festival finds itself inWhat is going on with Woodstock 50? The 50th anniversary celebration of the iconic 1969 festival was (is?) set to take place from August 16 to 18 in Watkins Glen, New York. This week, the festival’s investors announced that their company had “decided to cancel the festival.” However, Woodstock organizers claim that it will still happen, albeit with different financial backers. (The deep-sixing of Woodstock 50 would leave in the mud a lineup that didn’t come cheap. JAY-Z, Chance the Rapper, the Killers, Miley Cyrus, and other headliners have already received fees of $1 million to $3 million, reports .)The onset of problems is nothing new for Woodstock. The 1969 festival drove promoters almost into bankrupcy in its original year of “peace and love.” Woodstock ’94 featured artists fighting mud and rain, and, in the case of Green Day, literally fighting security guards. Woodstock ’99 notoriously descended into alleged violence and sexual assault.Was this golden-anniversary party doomed from the start? What happened? Here is a timeline attempting to piece together the key events that led to Woodstock 50’s possible collapse.Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, which sits on the original Woodstock site in Bethel, New York, announces that it will host a 50th-anniversary event. Bethel Woods Music and Culture Festival is billed as a “pan-generational music, culture and community event,” presented in partnership with Live Nation and branding agency INVNT. According to the , the announcement comes as Michael Lang, a co-producer of the original Woodstock, is prepping a separate celebration in nearby Watkins Glen.Lang announces Woodstock 50 in interviews with the  and . “We want this to be more than just coming to a concert,” he tells the , stressing that he wanted activism to play a significant role at the festival. Ticket prices aren’t unveiled, but Lang reportedly plans to sell 100,000 three-day passes. The bill, he tells , will be “eclectic… hip-hop and rock and some pop and some of the legacy bands from the original festival” while also potentially offering “some unique collaborations, maybe some reunions, and a lot of new and up-and-coming talent.” A press release claims that “a limited number of discounted pre-sale tickets will be available to college students ages 18-25 by the end of January.”The end of January, when pre-sale tickets were supposed to be available to college students, passes without any announcement from Woodstock 50.Rumors circle that Woodstock 50 is beset with financial problems.  claims that the reason no lineup had been announced was down to “issues regarding the raising of money and venue capacity.” Lang hits back at the speculation, telling , “There’s always been lots of rumors around Woodstock.”Woodstock 50 unveils its lineup, including JAY-Z, Chance the Rapper, the Killers, Miley Cyrus, Santana, Dead & Company, the Black Keys, Imagine Dragons, Halsey, Run the Jewels, and many more. Tickets, boasts a press release, “will go on sale on Earth Day, April 22.” (The press release makes no mention of the previously promised pre-sale for college students.)

We will get this information to you as soon as we receive it.”Tim O’Hearn, administrator of New York’s Schuyler County (which includes the Woodstock 50 venue site), tells the  that ticket sales couldn’t start until the state Department of Health issued a permit, and that the festival’s permit application is still under review. A Woodstock 50 rep told , “Just more rumors.”Woodstock 50’s website is updated to say that tickets will be available “soon,” not on Earth Day as previously announced.The original Woodstock site in Bethel finalizes the lineup for its 50th anniversary festivities. Bethel Woods Center for the Arts is set to host Ringo Starr, Santana, John Fogerty, and more, from August 16 to August 18. Santana and Fogerty are also scheduled to play at Woodstock 50 earlier that same weekend.Woodstock 50 organizers speak up about the ticket delay. “Woodstock 50 has delayed its on-sale while we refine logistical plans for what we anticipate will be an amazing festival in August at Watkins Glen, New York,” a statement by the Woodstock 50 partnership reads, as  reports. “Ticket on sale information will be available through Woodstock.com in the coming days.”O’Hearn, the Schuyler County Administrator, notes to  that the festival was forecasting an audience of 75,000, down from the earlier projection of 102,000—a reduction that implicitly raises the ticket prices Woodstock 50 would have to charge in order to meet its revenue expectations.During this week, a Woodstock 50 representative allegedly contacts Live Nation and AEG to ask about a $20 million rescue, and the two huge live entertainment companies both decline, according to .Dentsu Aegis Network, an investor in Woodstock 50, says that they have pulled the plug on the event. A statement to  reads:It’s a dream for agencies to work with iconic brands and to be
associated with meaningful movements. We have a strong history of
producing experiences that bring people together around common
interests and causes which is why we chose to be a part of the
Woodstock 50th Anniversary Festival. But despite our tremendous
investment of time, effort and commitment, we don’t believe the
production of the festival can be executed as an event worthy of the
Woodstock Brand name while also ensuring the health and safety of the
artists, partners and attendees. As a result and after careful
consideration, Dentsu Aegis Network’s Amplifi Live, a partner of
Woodstock 50, has decided to cancel the festival. As difficult as it
is, we believe this is the most prudent decision for all parties
involved.The New York State Department of Health spokesperson Erin Silk tells Pitchfork in a statement that the permit application pending with the agency didn’t cause the cancellation announcement. The statement reads:From the beginning planning stages, the New York State Department of
Health has worked closely and collaboratively with all parties
involved in Woodstock 50 to assure a safe and successful event.
Today’s cancellation announcement is not a result of the permit
application pending with the Department. The Department was surprised
to learn of today’s decision to cancel the event.Woodstock 50 organizers issue their own statement to Pitchfork denying the festival is canceled:We are committed to ensuring that the 50th Anniversary of Woodstock is
marked with a festival deserving of its iconic name and place in
American history and culture. Although our financial partner is
withdrawing, we will of course be continuing with the planning of the
festival and intend to bring on new partners. We would like to
acknowledge the State of New York and Schuyler County for all of their
hard work and support. The bottom line is, there is going to be a
Woodstock 50th Anniversary Festival, as there must be, and it’s going
to be a blast.Events company Superfly reportedly cuts ties with Woodstock 50. The festival’s production partner, which also works with Bonnaroo and Outside Lands, confirmed its withdrawal from the project to Rolling Stone. The same day, Lang was quoted as saying in an interview with Variety, “Superfly is on board at the moment, but I think we’re transitioning to another production entity.”Lang sends a letter to Dentsu claiming that the former investors “illegally swept approximately $17 million from the festival bank account.” He wrote, “We also have evidence that Dentsu representatives have gone so far as to say that should the talent back out of Woodstock, they would be seen favorably by Dentsu and that this could result in their performing the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where Dentsu is a major organizer.”Woodstock 50 asks for a court order against Dentsu. In a New York state court, the festival argued that its former investors should be required to “cease all communications relating to the Festival” and return $17.8 million to Woodstock’s bank account.Dentsu responds in court. In the filing, Dentsu claimed its Amplifi Live subsidiary had adhered to the festival’s contract, that the money from the bank account legally belonged to them, and that Lang had engaged in “misrepresentations, incompetence, and contractual breaches,” as Rolling Stone reports.The court’s ruling arrives, and it’s a mixed bag. A judge finds that while Woodstock 50 can continue as planned, Dentsu can keep the $17.8 million.Woodstock 50 gets new investors. Festival organizers said investment bank Oppenheimer & Co. had agreed to step in with financial backing.Woodstock 50 files an appeal for Dentsu to return some of the millions it withdrew from the festival’s bank account. Many details around the event’s financing, and future, remained unclear.Woodstock 50 loses its venue.

Last year’s  pored over internet-based anxieties while stripping song structures for parts, zeroing in on lonely floating synths or lithe guitar lines, influenced by freeform jazz and downtempo electronic music alike. Now the group have returned with “Mud,” yet another exercise in tension control that puts their signature intimate touch into practice. Padded with a bed of delicate synths and staggered drums, “Mud” finds vocalist Rahm Silverglade pondering his own “muddy mind” and feeling fettered to the tedium of day-to-day routine.“Mud” is sparse but affecting, enhanced by Silverglade’s murmuring, close-mic'd vocals. “Stuck in the mud all night while the brain rain pours,” he sings, his swampy metaphors standing in for everyday anxieties. “Make all the world go dry/Close your eyes until it does.” A chorus of eerie looped vocal samples flit in halfway through like a cloud of racing thoughts, while a spindly guitar line seems to coax Silverglade back from the edge by the song’s end. “Mud” serves as a further example of Altopalo’s skill at fusing the chilliness of technology with honest human feeling.",articles4,"['Altopalo', 'Altopalo’s']"

"Every month, Philip Sherburne locks into as many DJ mixes as his waking hours will allow, then sifts through the lot for the keepers. This month’s selections veer a little further left-of-center than usual, taking in eclectic club cuts from Philly’s DJ Haram, unreleased weirdness from Dublin’s Wah Wah Wino crew, and even a set of contemporary shoegaze from Alan Oldham, a Detroit techno icon.The New Jersey-bred, Philly-based DJ Haram delights in a kind of controlled chaos. This two-hour set for Rinse FM is a juggernaut of pile-driving kick drums, thundering breaks, and overdriven “Ha Dance” crashes. It covers a striking amount of ground, too: “Mentasm” stabs, polyrhythmic hand percussion, castanet techno, grime, Frank Ocean remixes, speedy Dance Mania sides, and (of course) saucy Jersey club. In the middle of all that madness, Toby Gale’s recent “Blessings” shimmers like a desert mirage, a harp-kissed deep-house refuge from the heavy artillery raining down all around.Solid Blake has been DJing as a member of Copenhagen’s Apeiron Crew since 2014, but only in the past couple of years has she begun putting out music under her own name, including an EP for her native Glasgow’s Outer Zone label in 2017 and a killer EP for Modeselektor’s Seilscheibenpfeiler imprint last year. Like those records, this set for Munich’s Ilian Tape goes hard on whip-cracking, bone-snapping electro beats backed with growling bass and eerie synthetic textures. Like the best electro, it’s imbued with a creeping sense of menace, steadily ratcheting up the tension to a breakbeat-smashing finale.In the late 1980s, while Detroit techno’s pioneers were stretching the fabric of space-time using synths and drum machines, bands across the pond were attempting a similar expansion of consciousness with guitars and fuzz pedals. So it’s not entirely surprising to discover that Alan Oldham, aka the Motor City veteran DJ T-1000, is a big shoegaze fan—big enough that this is his  mix devoted to the genre. His set avoids the obvious touchstones (My Bloody Valentine, Ride) in favor of latter-day acts capable of just as furious a swirl, like New Zealand’s Miniatures and Vancouver, British Columbia’s Palm Haze. Most of his selections date from this decade, and a surprising number are from just the last few years, making the set an excellent resource for anyone who’s long since worn out the grooves on their copy of . The mixing is clean and unobtrusive, concentrating mainly on getting from one reverb-soaked airlock chamber to the next, but no complaints there; this is as velvety an hour as you could ask for.On wryly titled records like  and Integrier Dich Du Yuppie (“Integrate Yourself, You Yuppie”), the Berlin musician known only as Mark has brought a cutting critical sensibility to equally sharp drum’n’bass tracks. His mixing, in this set for the Trilogy Tapes’ NTS Radio show, is right in line with the mood of his productions, layering ominously atmospheric drum’n’bass (Cybernet vs. Genetix’s 1996 single “Cyborg Two”) and tech-step (Sibilant’s 1998 cut “Mind the Step”) with jazz, postmodern folk, and even a few mind-bending selections from the Wire-related group P’O. The second half of the mix slows the tempo dramatically, shedding the breakbeat frenzy to sink into a slow-motion techno groove; the heavy mood lifts with the ambient free-jazz outro, as weirdly luminous as fog just before it burns off.Naemi is also known as exael, a Berlin-based musician who recently turned up alongside Huerco S. and uon in the trio Ghostride the Drift. As you might expect from those affiliations, ambient is the order of the day in this 90-minute mix for Melbourne’s Sanpo Disco series. But where exael’s solo work is a flickering, unstable fusion of beatless drones, dub techno, and abstract noise,  drops any pretense of being chilly or unapproachable, diving headfirst into jazzy downtempo, border-hopping dub, and private-press 1970s psych. Between the Jeru the Damaja instrumental and the vintage Spacetime Continuum cut, the set is shot through with the sensibility of 1990s chillout rooms at their most adventurous, full of gently thrilling twists and turns you never see coming.In a few short years, Dublin’s Wah Wah Wino label has established itself as one of the strangest outfits in leftfield dance music. Its catalog is only eight records deep, but every release so far—Davy Kehoe’s harmonica-soaked krautrock, Wino-D’s clattery post-punk—has been totally unique. In the first hour of this set for Belgium’s Meakusma Festival, Poppa Wino offers a preview of the crew’s upcoming material, snaking an unusual path through blues guitar, wriggly 2-step, and humid digi-dub. Hour two is allegedly an all-minidisc set recorded live at a Dublin music store “without the owner realising.” How that played out in practice is anybody’s guess: A DJ set on minidisc I can just about wrap my head around, but the gear-store connection? Was he actually playing the instruments on display? The results, regardless, are cryptic and captivating.Turn this set from London’s Shelley Parker up loud enough, and you may find the objects in your home vibrating in unexpected ways. Parker’s output straddles sound art and club music—she’s released both on the experimental hub Entr’acte and the totemic bass imprint Hessle Audio—but whatever the context, her music is unusually attentive to sound’s physical properties. This set, recorded in one take on CDJs, creeps up on you: It begins with throbbing low-end minimalism, goosebump-inducing trip-hop, and brain-melting instrumental hip-hop and gradually increases intensity, shifting through dubstep, electro, and, finally, full-on techno, climaxing with a killer acid jam by Lauren Flax. The hyperspeed finale is just the icing on her many-layered cake.Former  critic Ben Ratliff’s recent book  argues that the streaming era has facilitated increasingly fluid modes of listening, in which old categories like genre and period give way to qualities like slowness, density, and space. No surprise, then, that Ratliff’s approach to mixing proposes a similar perceptual shift, slicing diagonally across Balinese chant, Bo Diddley’s blues, and Paul Hindemith’s viola sonatas to reveal hidden links between the three. Tilted toward jazz and Brazilian music, the set’s full of provocative connections and individual moments of singular beauty—along with the occasional curveball that might knock you right out of your chair.",articles4,"['Philip Sherburne', 'Toby Gale’s', 'Solid Blake', 'Glasgow’s Outer Zone', 'Tape', 'Ride', 'New Zealand', 'British Columbia’s Palm Haze', 'Mark', 'Trilogy', 'Drift', 'Davy Kehoe', 'Parker’s', 'Lauren Flax', 'Ben Ratliff’s', 'Ratliff’s', 'Bo Diddley’s', 'Paul Hindemith’s']"
"Chvrches recently stated they were disappointed by recent collaborator Marshmello’s choice to work with Brown, who they described as an “abuser”Chvrches recently posted a statement on their social media expressing they were “really upset, confused, and disappointed” by recent collaborator Marshmello’s decision to work with Tyga and Chris Brown on the new single “Light It Up.” “We like and respect Mello as a person but working with people who are predators and abusers enables, excuses and ultimately tacitly endorses that behavior,” they wrote. “That is not something we can or will stand behind.”Today, Chris Brown took to Chvrches’ Instagram to leave a comment (viewed by Pitchfork) on one of their posts: “BUNCH OF LOSERS. these are the type of people I wish walked in front of a speeding bus full of mental patients.

"What if girls owned the world? Bikini Kill once wrote a song about that deeply utopian idea. “For Tammy Rae,” the melancholy daydream of a closer from 1993’s , was the first Bikini Kill song I ever saw live. I sat on a plastic chair and watched in disbelief. “We can’t hear a word they say,” Kathleen Hanna sang vulnerably. “Let’s pretend we own the world today.”It was November of 2017, and for three nights the feminist punks of New York City and beyond had overtaken the storied Manhattan art space The Kitchen. The occasion was a series of celebrations for the legendary UK punk band the Raincoats, loosely organized around my then-recent book on their 1979 debut album. At this final event, organized by Raincoat Shirley O’Loughlin and dubbed “The Raincoats and Friends,” I was slated to read in between a series of screenings and performances, including one from Bikini Kill drummer Tobi Vail. Just a few hours before doors, when the Raincoats’ live drummer, Vice Cooler, alerted me to the fact that “three members of Bikini Kill” were in the building, I spiraled quickly from puzzled to shook to awe to glee. No one knew this would happen. When Vail, bassist Kathi Wilcox, and singer-guitarist Kathleen Hanna took the stage together, linear time collapsed.The members of Bikini Kill hadn’t played together, let alone hung out, in 20 years. But when the Raincoats asked Vail to do a song at the Kitchen event, she agreed, not quite knowing what she would do. The Olympia-based Vail asked Wilcox, who lives in New York, to perform with her; they floated ideas. “Suddenly Kathi emailed me back and was like, ‘Would you be opposed to playing with Kathleen?’” Vail recalled to me when I reached her by phone on Wednesday, the day before Bikini Kill’s first proper reunion show, held last night at the Hollywood Palladium. At the time, Vail was caught off guard: “I said, ‘I’m not opposed, why would I be opposed?’ [].” She suggested they do a song from their early days as a three-piece. “For Tammy Rae” was, Vail told me, also a favorite Bikini Kill song of Kurt Cobain’s.Reunions can be complicated, and Bikini Kill had turned down offers for years. But something shifted in 2017. They meditated on the ideal scenario: just a few shows, see how it feels. Rehearsals quietly began last spring between New York and Los Angeles, where Hanna now lives. “We’ve been working up to it for quite a while but in little bursts,” Vail says. They also recruited a new guitarist in underground punk hero Erica Dawn Lyle, since original guitarist Billy Karren was unable to participate.When Bikini Kill announced the first string of shows in January, it was a legitimate shock. The wild demand for tickets and massive venue sizes were a testament to the several generations of all-ages fans for whom this band is not just like the Sex Pistols or the Beatles, but a kind of art-feminist scripture, ground zero of a way to live, like their peers Fugazi. In the late ’90s, Bikini Kill would have been more likely to play to several hundred people, not tens of thousands, as they will over their four-night run at the 5,000-capacity Hollywood Palladium, four sold-out NYC shows, and two in London.Tobi Vail at Bikini Kill’s first Palladium show. Photo by Michelle Groskopf.Both Hanna and Vail said that the Raincoats were a big reason for the reunion (“We were all very moved by seeing that show,” Vail adds). I’ve had many of my own transcendent experiences watching the Raincoats play: They are in their 60s and 70s and still perform regularly, exuding total unselfconscious joy and resilience, forging inspired cross-generational dialogue with their work. The Raincoats have been a source of inspiration for Vail since her teenage years (and friends since Bikini Kill toured the UK in 1993), but at The Kitchen she saw something more: older women continuing to make art with humor, ferocity, and deep friendship. “Our struggles as feminists in punk have been different, but I see it as a sort of similar thing, where maybe the world wasn’t ready for the Raincoats at the time,” Vail says. “I consider their music to be pretty threatening to the status quo, if we consider the status quo to be patriarchy and the music industry.”The two bands also share an “inherently anti-professional aesthetic,” Vail says, and both make work that highlights the process of punk. This has an instigating power: It was Bikini Kill’s goal to encourage all girls everywhere to start bands or make fanzines in order to help write the language of culture—to not just be consumers—and, in turn, help create the world. “In order to incite participation in the making of culture, it seems important to have an aesthetic that is a little bit messy or unpolished, so that girls and women can see the process of creating on stage as part of the performance,” Vail says. “It’s strange to see that move to the center of popular culture. Normally it would just happen in a basement or a squat. One question we’ve been asking is: What does it even mean that we’re doing this now, in this way? It’s interesting, we don’t know.”Bikini Kill’s insurrectionism feels more vital than ever. Their cool protest songs predicted and shaped our current cultural moment, in which recognizing the politics in art is non-negotiable. “It’s a different time, but it is and it isn’t,” Vail says. “Patriarchy still exists, sexism still exists. The structure of society has not changed. Dominant hierarchies reproduce themselves, whether it’s capitalism or white supremacy or homophobia. Part of the project becomes: How do we use our voices to help move things forward? We’re being given a voice again, or seizing that platform, so what are we going to do with it? That’s what we’re trying to figure out.” She echoed activist Angela Davis throughout our talk: “It’s a constant struggle.”The perilous state of the world created an urgency in Vail personally. In 2016, after both the Ghost Ship fire and the election of Trump, she fell into a depression. She found that she couldn’t read the news, couldn’t really do anything except play music every day. Vail learned Beatles songs on guitar, then turned back to the drums. “When I feel the least powerful, I try to figure out: What’s the most powerful I can be? What’s something I’m the best at?” she says. “It came down to a basic survival strategy: How am I gonna live? I realized that music is my survival strategy.”Among a charged punk songbook that often reads like it was written yesterday, Vail particularly mentions the guttural  cut “Lil Red,” an intense recasting of Little Red Riding Hood in which Hanna sings, “Here’s my life, why don’t you take it/Here’s my cunt, why don’t you rape it.” “Remember when everyone thought Trump wasn’t going to get elected because that video came out of him talking about grabbing the pussy?” Vail asks. “That just seems like the response.”“I don’t think any of us were interested in doing some kind of nostalgic exercise, but the songs need to be out there—and personally, we feel like playing them. So it’s a way to keep these songs alive,” she adds. “We’ll be in practice, and I’ll just be playing drums and I’ll get chills thinking about how the lyrics speak to what’s happening today, or somebody will start crying while we’re playing a song. In the course of our band, that feeling probably wore off towards the end. But now we’re feeling it.”That was palpable from the crowd. I came to the Palladium by myself, but this was not a show you really go to “alone”: Everyone was together. I had never seen a full Bikini Kill set—I was in elementary school when they broke up—but I have lived for at least a decade with the mythology of Bikini Kill shows from films like Lucy Thane’s . Their shows were thought to be not just “the frontline of teen-girl pain” but a war against patriarchy, embodied by the men who would come to just hassle the band. “Girls to the front” seemed like a daring Fluxus art instruction. The oxygen in those rooms seemed symbolic: a life force.The front row. Photo by Michelle Groskopf.My place in the audience was at an apex of wide eyes, shrieks, tears, neon hair, crowd surfers, and women collectively roaring—in the opener, “Carnival”—“I’ll win that Mötley Crüe mirror if it fucking kills me!” Everyone around me seemed very young, and when Hanna tried to compute the number of years it had been since Bikini Kill played a show (Japan, 1997), all the girls in front of me, who were clearly born in the late 1990s, shouted “22! 22!” The day before the show, I picked up my 14-year-old friend from LAX, who’d traveled from Olympia for the reunion; afterwards he told me it made him cry. This cross-generational aspect—extended by the opener, punk icon Alice Bag—added to the show’s electric purpose. Hanna sang a bit of Cher’s “Turn Back Time” before rendering the sentiment useless: She’d rather be here.Music fans today are cynical about reunions, and not without reason. But as I stood near the front, alternately moshing and pogoing and just getting pushed around the sticky sea of bodies, I felt something direct and ideal. I may have missed Bikini Kill in their first iteration, but an audience with only a couple of punisher bros—it brought me no pleasure to have the authentic Bikini Kill experience of shutting one down, to cheers around me—was a fair trade. (This was also, I’d wager, the best-sounding set in Bikini Kill history.) I saw the past catching up to the present, a historical corrective, a hard-earned platform, and a thrilling “no” to the fraudulent idea that women “punk rock performance artists over 30” (Hanna’s words) should just go away. Part of the genuine excitement of a Bikini Kill set still comes from how they swap instruments constantly—Wilcox exploring the drums, Vail shredding a deviant scream—as if the stage were a merry-go-round, a curiosity, breathing. It made the set feel like a conversation between themselves and with us. There was no fossilized version of punk here.They played 27 songs. Each one felt like real life, right now. “Resist Psychic Death” is the ultimate mantra of survival in the modern chains of mindless scrolling. “I Hate Danger” is a hammer to the plague of male condescension. “Capri Pants” is a Misfits-hop away from toxicity. In the brash anthem “Jigsaw Youth,” Hanna chants a quote from the James Dean movie : “We go with the kids/Yeah yeah yeah yeah.” Vail, who wore a T-shirt for young Olympia glam-punks Rik and the Pigs during part of the set, told me: “Youth under capitalism is kind of a bankrupt idea. You’re allowed a sort of freedom and then you have to eventually conform and go back to the square world, to the machine. [...] What does it mean to take that kind of freedom that capitalism allows young people into adulthood?”Every blazing note of this set was a potential response, ringing with triumph, with proof that there is a wrongness to everything real, with the vindication of having the exact right words to eviscerate someone who makes you feel smaller than you’ll ever be. To scream a Bikini Kill lyric is to let these emotions and philosophies coarse through your body. It is to locate the ecstasy of your heart and brain swelling in unison because of art that feels like it truly belongs to you. Every song was a celebration of that fact. “Your world has taught me nothing,” Hanna sang with fire on “Feels Blind,” a reminder of the grave inadequacy of society. For 90 minutes, it felt like we had built our own.",articles4,"['Suddenly Kathi', 'Kill’s', 'Sex Pistols', 'Fugazi', 'We’ll', 'Everyone', 'Fluxus', 'Photo', 'Everyone', 'Alice Bag', 'Cher', 'Misfits', 'Every']"

"Listen to the track below“This is where the country opens up and things get a little weird,” Bruce Springsteen writes in his memoir about a pivotal road trip out west. It was the early ’80s and he was learning, for the first time, how to cope with depression in a real way. “As Sisyphus can count on the rock,” he writes. “I can always count on the road, the music, and the miles for whatever ails me.” Here is the implicit promise of his music, presented with all the burdens and hard consequences attached. Remember: the door is open but the ride ain’t free.His gorgeous new song “Hello Sunshine” takes place somewhere on the journey. Its friendly, country arrangement sits within a long lineage of radio classics: “Everybody’s Talkin,’” “Gentle on My Mind,” “Good Time Charlie’s Got the Blues,” all songs borne from quiet barrooms in the early hours of the morning. As if to prove his place among them, Springsteen spends an entire verse humming along, strings guiding the way like light from a jukebox. Amid the glow, he’s surrounded by pedal steel raining on the windows, a hushed honky-tonk piano in the corner, a brush-stroked rhythm section that feels like running in place on a soft dirt road. Bold but lived-in, it’s the most vivid his music has sounded in at least two decades.The words are sparse but important. The road is “empty” not “open.” Sunshine is a passing stranger not an absent friend. “You walk too far, you walk away,” he cautions in a low, weathered croon. As the first single from an album that’s been sidelined for the better part of the decade—first for an Obama-era protest statement, later for a jubilant if backward-looking E Street Band tour, and most recently for a one-man Broadway show that turned the span of his songbook into a seemingly complete narrative with a (mostly) happy ending—its pulse feels particularly inspired. It’s a song about changing your ways while there are still miles left to travel, sung by someone with the landscape etched into his heart.",articles4,"['Bruce Springsteen', 'Springsteen', 'E Street Band']"

"The long-running hip-hop festival must stop using the title of LL’s 1985 single without the rapper’s permissionIn November, LL Cool J filed a lawsuit against the promoters behind the hip-hop music festival Rock the Bells—which bears the same name as LL’s 1985 hit single from his LP . Now, LL has won the lawsuit, Billboard reports and legal documents viewed by Pitchfork confirm.The initial suit alleged that in 2004, concert promoter Guerilla Union and its founder Chang Weisberg filed to trademark the title “Rock the Bells,” which they used for its web domain and social media channels in addition to the festival itself. LL later appealed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in an attempt to to cancel Guerilla Union’s Rock the Bells trademarks.Now, a California federal judge has ruled that Guerrilla Union must stop using the title “Rock the Bells” without the rapper’s permission. Guerrilla Union must permanently refrain from “manufacturing, transporting, promoting, importing, advertising, publicizing, distributing, offering for sale, or selling any goods or services” under the “Rock the Bells” name, naming LL Cool J the “exclusive owner” of that trademark. According to the judgment, Guerrilla Union must turn over all items bearing LL’s “Rock the Bells” trademark by May 10, so that they may be destroyed.LL will also gain account administration over the rockthebells.net website, “Rock the Bells” social media handles, and any email accounts associated with the name.",articles4,"['LL’s', 'Appeal Board']"

It’s rap as singer-songwriter coffee-shop music with performances so lukewarm the entire thing feels low effort by extension. The song, which also features Brockhampton members JOBA and bearface, and was produced by Jabari Manwa and Romil Hemnani with Jack Antonoff, is the kind of woozy, disaffected hybrid that’s become all too common among style benders like Cuco and Gus Dapperton. This modest team effort can’t help but feel looser and lesser in comparison. Abstract, of course, remains at the center of “Peach”—not to be confused with the Brockhampton outtake of the same name—which lives inside a romance it never really unpacks, content to operate in a fog of ambiguity (“Shit, man, you was just a baby/And I turned on you like Mother Nature”).

"Most vinyl fiends hunt that perfect, elusive gem. Los Angeles-based collector and musician Greg Wooten digs for distinctly imperfect records. Wooten’s new art book, Marred for Life!, is a curated slice of his massive collection of defaced records, featuring covers with additions and alterations ranging from blacked-out eyeballs to commentary like “sexist cover” (on a copy of Bow Wow Wow’s ).Wooten explains that his fascination with artfully vandalized records began with a copy of Jefferson Airplane’s , discovered at L.A.’s Amoeba Music about five years ago. “Someone had added hand-drawn rows of joints and pot leaves all over the brown bag outer sleeve,” he recalls over email. After that initial discovery, Wooten began purposefully seeking out defaced records. While he’s always looking for cleverly modified covers, he does have standards. “Covers with only names written on them don’t make the cut,” he says. “I also pass on defacement that is only radio station call letters, unless they have good placement. I have a Nina Simone cover with the station call letters written on her teeth.”By now, Wooten’s collection has grown to around 1,500 records. A network of digger friends and strangers also contributed their freaky finds to . Of this gigantic library, Wooten figures that he has the most copies of the Beatles’ White Album—the barren cover is an irresistible blank slate. “Simon & Garfunkel got hit pretty hard too, both individually and as a duo,” he adds. “Those big face covers were just asking for it!” His favorite spoiled treasure might be the one that appears on the book’s cover: a skeleton dancing across a 1957 album by the composer and trumpeter Billy May.For the book, Wooten whittled it down to 250 covers with the aid of photographer and art-book editor Jason Fulford. The result is a whimsical array of mischief that is very fun to flip through. Below, Wooten shares his thoughts on highlights from .“Someone masterfully painted a skeleton on the dancing woman,” Wooten says. “It’s so tightly executed it feels like it should be the original version. I also fondly remember exactly where I found it: in the crappy, cheap record bins of a Ventura thrift shop. It jumped out at me from a sea of Nancy Wilson and Bing Crosby records. The adrenaline rush from that discovery is unforgettable.”“This is a top five for me. I scored this at a garage record sale one Saturday morning in L.A. I almost died when I saw a guy holding it who was only interested in owning  and seemingly had no special interest in this fantastically altered (by pencil eraser) cover. When I miraculously found another copy with a ‘nice’ cover, I persuaded the other digger to swap with me! About a year later, I found Hendrix’s , also eraser-altered. I can’t help but think they were defaced by the same person, and it felt amazing to reunite them in the book. I’m not surprised that Jimi could conjure up this kind of synchronicity.”“There’s so much fun stuff in the details of this one. I love the  and [StarKist brand mascot] Charlie the Tuna references.”“I love the simplicity of the X on this handmade cover, with the creator clearly riffing on ‘eXodus.’” (Handmade [covers are] a subcategory of the defaced project—not really altered but rather, completely hand-drawn on a blank cover.) “This came with a whole collection found at Jacknife Records & Tapes in L.A., all hand-drawn with colored Sharpies.”“One of my favorites—someone diagonally yanked-off the often lenticular cover image and drew in cartoonish heads of the Fab Four, with just a bit of the Stones peeking out from behind. Considering the rivalry between these two bands, you gotta love this!”“One of just a few covers in the collection done by a known artist—in this case, Doug Erb. I really love Doug’s work and was happy to include him in otherwise anonymous territory.”“This Janis LP is a great example of the really intense, L.A.-style, Cholo-tagged defacing. It almost feels like it’s carved into the cover.”“There’s something really graphic and fun in a Warholian kind of way going on here. Found in New York City at Academy Records.”“I love the dichotomy going on between the music and the hand-drawn cover. It strikes me as funny that such a highly produced and sonically lush record received this incredibly naive, childlike cover drawing.”“This one kinda got snuck into the collection by a mysterious and notorious Long Beach character known as Wanksy.”“A gem from the ‘thought bubble’ subcategory—I find it to be a wonderful example of the silly humor found in the collection. It immediately brings to mind another one of my favorites [from the book]—Frank Marino and Mahogany Rush’s , where the defacer turned ‘unexpected’ into ‘expected’ and added a thought-bubble simply saying, ‘yawn.’ I’m assuming this was created by someone NOT a fan of guitar-god shredding!”“A nice example of collage being used for defacing—the googly eyes were drawn on paper and then pasted on. Jason did something really fun with the front and back covers of the book; he dropped in several defaced elements that appear on covers in the collection, to in essence deface our book. Those John Denver googly eyes look so awesome in gold foil, worked into the front cover design.”",articles4,"['Wooten’s', 'Bow Wow Wow’s', 'Wooten’s', 'Billy May', 'Ventura', 'Nancy Wilson', 'Hendrix’s', 'Tapes', 'Doug’s', 'Mahogany Rush’s', 'John Denver']"

He completed a probation sentence in that case in 2015. Since then, Brown has faced weapons charges as well as a civil suit by a woman who claimed she was sexually assaulted while on his property.In January 2019, Chris Brown was arrested in Paris, France after a woman filed a report of aggravated rape against him. The singer subsequently denied the allegations, was released from police custody, and authorized to leave France while an investigation was conducted. He also filed a countersuit against his accuser for defamation.In 2015, Tyga was criticized for lyrics alluding to sexual liasons with then-girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who was 17 at the time. His song “Pleazer” featured the line, “T nasty, 'bout to catch a felony for it/Vagina juice like orange juice in the mornin'.” (California law defines “statutory rape” or “unlawful sex with a minor” as the act of any individual having sexual intercourse with another individual under the age of 18.)In 2016, a 14-year-old girl claimed she had “uncomfortable” communication with Tyga over Instagram, and that she cut off contact with him once he asked to meet her in person. At the time, the rapper’s manager stated that the girl had falsely communicated that she was 17, and that Tyga had only contacted her about her music.When reached by Pitchfork, representatives for Chvrches offered no further comment.

"Listen to the track belowThe word “flamboyant” was originally used to describe the ostentatiousness and grandeur of gothic architecture. But, in some instances, it’s slipped into the English vernacular as a way to police queer people when they’re perceived as dressing or acting in non-heteronormative ways. On their new single “Flamboyant,” pop artist Dorian Electra (who appeared on Charli XCX’s Pop 2 track “Femmebot” alongside Mykki Blanco) proudly reclaims the titular word in their uniquely campy way. “I’m a very flaming, flammable guy/Some say my fire burns way too high,” they croon in a low, robotic growl over a downtempo electro-pop groove. Their manifesto of defiance is soon matched by maximal production, with ripping J-pop synth chords and dramatic musical flourishes, like a cartoon smack or a frantic organ run.To get the entire “Flamboyant” experience, though, you must watch the accompanying music video. Donning a collection of incredible ensembles, Electra serves glitter pirate Liberace, brooding  bachelor, and seapunk R&B singer from the ’90s. Wearing their signature blushing red eyeshadow and a tiny Sharpied-on moustache, they gaze into the camera, daring anyone to question their sartorial choices. When they begin to sing, “‘Turn down for what,’ they ask me,” in an earnestly weepy voice, it’s clear that they’re in on the joke. Their commitment to the bit is as courageous as it is outrageous.",articles4,"['Dorian Electra', 'Mykki Blanco']"

"Listen to the track belowLast spring, FKA twigs revealed in a post on Instagram that she had to have six fibroid tumors removed earlier that winter. “Thank you precious body for healing... you are a wonderful thing, now go create and be other once again,” she wrote. Those words were accompanied by a video of her cautiously practicing pole dancing moves, displaying pride in the emerging strength of her body after surgery. Ever since, she has been intermittently posting these videos of her pole dancing progress—in between clips of her martial arts training—showing her becoming more and more skillful and powerful. Now, one year after her operation, on her breathtaking new single “Cellophane,” twigs strips back her usual glitchy and twitchy electronic production to reveal her hypnotizing voice, more exposed than ever before.The musical elements accompanying twigs are minimal: there’s the warbling piano that moves at the glacial pace of Erik Satie, someone lightly making chugging noises through their teeth, the soft presence of strings, a random lurch of squelching mechanics. Synths drag in and out, sounding like a massive, rumbling UFO softly circling the song, deciding whether it wants to beam her up. But “Cellophane” doesn’t need much, as twigs’ delicate voice is just impossibly moving here. In between short gasps, she sings uncomplicated words that seem drenched with complicated feelings. “I don’t want to have to share our love,” she sings, like the words are burning the inside of her mouth. But by the end of the song, her falsetto soars, calling upon a philosophy that twigs has often invoked in her songwriting: Vulnerability is your greatest strength.In the accompanying video, directed by Bjӧrk collaborator Andrew Thomas Huang, twigs performs a stunning lyrical pole dancing routine, pulling off complicated spins and inverted holds at a level of proficiency that makes it hard to believe that she only started learning the art over a year ago. (In a statement, she revealed that she took it up for the sole purpose of including it in the “Cellophane” video.) She pulls herself high on the pole until it becomes a vine, and she encounters a robotic alien fly that has her face. After it kicks her down into an earthy underworld, scrambling women rush to cover her skin with red clay. It’s a mashup of the Icarus myth and the Phoenix myth: twigs’ fall and her rebirth.",articles4,"['Instagram', 'Those', 'Erik Satie']"

With the help of indie producer Will Yip, Mannequin Pussy polish their feverish rock into something more traditionally melodic.“Drunk II” opens on guitarist and vocalist Marisa Dabice in a post-breakup mania, evading despair by drinking and partying to excess. But despite her best efforts to self-anesthetize, sadness breaks through. “I still love you, you stupid fuck,” she barks with a bittersweet grimace. Yet the song quickly reveals itself to be more than sloshed yearning: Atop a melancholic and measured riff, Dabice wrangles with her behavior, revealing vulnerability with an intimate wistfulness: “And everyone says to me/‘Missy, you’re so strong!’/But what if I don’t want to be?”As Dabice unburdens herself of frustration, the band swells to an astringent high, and her anguished voice suddenly picks up a second track. “I am alone,” she murmurs, simultaneously shouting over herself: “Everyone gather round, I have the answer now.”",articles4,"['Pussy', 'Dabice']"
"The removal comes amid sexual assault allegations against singer Dahvie VanitySpotify removed every song by the electronic group Blood on the Dance Floor over the weekend, the company confirmed to Billboard and Pitchfork. Spotify also confirmed that the band’s songs were removed because of their content and not because of sexual abuse allegations against Jesus David Torres, the lead singer of the group, who performs under the name Dahvie Vanity. As  reports, it seems likely that the group’s music was taken down for violating the company’s prohibited content guidelines, which forbid “infringing content” and “hate content.”Spotify defines hate content as music that “promotes, advocates, or incites hatred or violence against a group or individual based on characteristics, including, race, religion, gender identity, sex, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, veteran status, or disability.” Blood on the Dance Floor have multiple songs that promote violence against women (including “Revenge Porn,” “Bitches Get Stitches,” and “Sluts Get Guts”).  Spotify did not specify its exact reason for the removal, other than confirming in general that it was due to the songs’ content. The company also did not comment on why other songs by other artists that promote violence against women have not been removed.Torres was the subject of recent reports in HuffPost and MetalSucks that outlined allegations of sexual abuse, including forced vaginal, anal, and oral sex from 21 different women. Many of those women were minors at the time of the alleged incidents. HuffPost also cites a 2007 police report that claims Torres apologized to police over the phone for allegedly forcing a 14-year-old girl to perform oral sex on him. As HuffPost reports, according to the detective who spoke with him, “that apology wasn’t interpreted as an official admission of guilt because Torres was speaking over the phone—not in a formal setting. Police didn’t feel the need to bring Torres in for proper questioning due to reasons including [the 14-year-old's] reluctance to cooperate with the investigation.”Pitchfork has reached out to Blood on the Dance Floor for further comment.Last year, Spotify rolled out its controversial “Hate Content & Hateful Conduct” policy, in which artists such as XXXTentacion and R. Kelly were removed from the platform’s editorial and algorithmic playlists. “When an artist or creator does something that is especially harmful or hateful (for example, violence against children and sexual violence), it may affect the ways we work with or support that artist or creator,” the company said in a statement at the time.Less than a month later, Spotify walked the policy back, announcing it was “moving away from implementing a policy around artist conduct.” Earlier this year, Spotify rolled out a “mute button” that allows users to block specific artists.",articles4,"['Spotify', 'Bitches Get Stitches', 'Spotify', 'Torres', 'Torres', 'Torres', 'Spotify', 'XXXTentacion', 'Earlier', 'Spotify']"

"It’s not even noon and Bikini Kill’s newest member is already waxing philosophic about punk. “Are we trying to make theory out of our DIY practice?” Erica Dawn Lyle casually asks during our video interview, her lips splashed with bright red lipstick. “Do we have a lived practice that becomes ideas afterwards? Or do we have a set of instructions that we're trying to follow, that becomes our lived practice?”Lyle has just gotten back to New York following a week of guerrilla filmmaking in Miami. Soon she’ll hit the West Coast for the first of Bikini Kill’s reunion shows, taking the place of original guitarist Billy Karren. Her road to one of punk’s most storied bands is accidental and circuitous, to say the least. Now 45, Lyle is a cat with nine lives who’s learned from every one of them.At 17, she escaped a violent home just outside of Miami, taking refuge in the southern Florida punk scene. She lived in squats, served free vegan meals via Food Not Bombs, and played in several bands. One of them, Chickenhead, was partially a response to skinhead activity in the Florida scene, and they used provocative stage performances, like breaking and rolling in glass, to discourage violence at shows. It was this group that first brought Lyle to the attention of Tobi Vail, Bikini Kill’s drummer.By 20, Lyle had relocated to San Francisco and turned more of her attention toward activism. Between 1995 and 2009, she organized around issues like war, homelessness, and gentrification, documenting these experiences for publications including her own longtime punk zine, , and her eventual book, . But as the cost of living in the Bay accelerated, Lyle’s building was converted into “micro-hotel rooms” and she found herself evicted.Since coming to New York a decade ago, Lyle has kept busy as a freelance art critic for the likes of  and , a co-founder of the Brooklyn art space 7 Belvidere, and an active guitarist and drummer. The next issue of  is in the works, and just this week Lyle and her longtime musical partner Ivy Jeanne dropped , a tender collection of folk-punk songs, sales of which will benefit the Emma Deboncoeur Trans Health Scholarship Fund. We caught up with her about joining Bikini Kill and a life well spent in punk activism.Erika Dawn Lyle: Tobi Vail and I were in a short-lived band in Olympia called Knife in the Eye around 2010. It’s phenomenal playing with Tobi because she’s a really powerful drummer—when I’m playing with someone with that kind of powerful beat, it’s like playing and dancing fuse together. I get so much somatic joy out of experiencing the songs as we’re playing. So when Tobi contacted me in 2017 and asked if I would consider playing with Bikini Kill, I was like, “Hmm, OK!” I felt like I was getting drafted or something.I can’t speak on behalf of the band, but as a longtime fan, it makes sense to me. A lot of people today don’t know what it was like when Bikini Kill was playing in the 1990s, but the stuff they went through was really gnarly. I only saw them play a couple of times, and I wasn't close with them then. But I remember they drew a lot of  negative energy from men and women who just didn’t want things to change. They really churned it up, but they took the hatred people gave them and used it to make music that was strong and enduring.To me, the band embodies a time in recent history when there was grassroots self-organizing among women on a massive scale. Music is a way of bringing people together, and Bikini Kill’s return offers encouragement and support to women looking to fight back during this tremendously misogynist moment in America. I also think there’s a lot of societal pressure for middle-aged women to simply disappear. It’s powerful for Bikini Kill to come back as older women and contribute their energies.A lot of what I’ve done over the years has been around creating alternatives. Punk was a way to plug into something outside of myself. To be in a really shitty family situation in a small town, then finding the agency to participate and make my own culture was really important. That’s what punk did for me. And I realized, if you make the thing—a band, a zine, whatever—then you find your people.Now I’m really looking for people who want to come together and have real-life conversations, not Facebook conversations or monetized conversations where we’re selling our subjectivity to each other in order to have status within a scene. I want people to have vulnerable conversations with each other about how we’re going to face the crisis of this moment, which is manifesting in things like gentrification and climate change. How are we going to take care of each other? How are we going to keep our culture alive? I try to create opportunities for that to happen.The magazine started as a way to document the life my friends and I were leading as teenagers, which was getting everything for free [through scams, stealing, and resource-sharing]. But it was also a way to participate in and broaden my community. As I got older, my interests changed. I became less interested specifically in punk and more involved in activism, and I started doing other self-publishing projects for a broader audience.  is sort of morphing into more longform, underground journalism, where I try to cover things outside of the mainstream but in a really careful and thoughtful way.It's important to me to still do because I don’t think subcultural communities think a lot about infrastructure. People are concerned with whether or not a band is on a major label but not how small labels survive. Where does the money come from? How do things get distributed? How is gentrification affecting access to things? So for me,  is about participating in an underground cultural network. It’s about my relationships with bookstores and distributors and readers and the people and places I cover.Emma was Ivy [Jeanne, Lyle collaborator]’s and my friend who passed away last year. For many years, I had wondered, “Am I going to transition?” [Lyle transitioned two and a half years ago], and Emma represented, to me, winning at being trans. She was a super beautiful, smart, rad, funny, interesting person who had a really wonderful romantic partner. She was well-respected in her community and was able to go to nursing school and do public health work. It’s difficult to transition. You receive hatred from society. But looking at Emma, I saw that you can actually carve out a wonderful space for yourself.After she died, Ivy mentioned being involved in starting a scholarship for transgender students
at UC Berkeley and UCSF, focused on transgender health and wellness. And I’m really interested in digital downloads as a way to raise money, because it’s immaterial. You don’t have to spend money to make the record or mail anything, so it seems like there’s a profit margin that could be exploited for a good cause.I’ve always longed for a lot of freedom. I figured out how to rig my life so that I can spend most of my time doing things that engage productively with other people. I’ve made a lot of choices to not have money or stability or security in order to be able to pursue that state of creative engagement.I’m not sure what’s driving me. When I was a kid, I was motivated by revenge, mostly because my parents tried to kill me. I was going to prove that I was not going to be killed. There’s still a healthy dose of that inside me. Also, who can  be motivated to fight against the horrific conditions that we’re living under right now?I have a profound sense that the world should be different. I want to be very visible and join others to change things. Visibility is a trap, though. On the one hand, if you’re visible you’re more in danger: Many trans women I know who have done political things in public have been doxxed or physically attacked. But on the other, being visible is the only way to explode the secrecy and shame around queer and trans lives. It’s the only way to change the mainstream’s mind about who transgender people are: by simply existing in a public way.",articles4,"['Health Scholarship Fund', 'I’m', 'Facebook', 'Ivy', 'Jeanne', 'Ivy']"

Now, the single has been officially released—that’s it below.The diss refers to 6ix9ine’s reported plea deal and cooperation with federal prosecutors following his November 2018 arrest. 6ix9ine was taken into custody for nine federal crime charges that include racketeering and firearm charges.YG has a history of sparring with the jailed rapper, reignited last year in his “Bulletproof” video.

"Listen to the track belowTwo-plus hours of  documentary film, a stellar accompanying live album, and still the Beyoncé vaults have more treasure to be found. “Sorry - Original Demo,” a previously unreleased version of the  track that appeared—along with the rest of the album—on streaming services today, envisions a full song crafted from what became the sorrowful final verse of the album cut. This “Sorry” demo doesn’t include the titular line, nor several other memorable  catchphrases—no “suck on my balls,” no “middle fingers up,” no “boy bye.” It’s an earlier draft not just of a song but of an emotion, the hurt fresher even as the frustration starts to boil.Sadness weighs heavy on the “Sorry” demo, both in the tear-stained instrumental loop and in Beyoncé’s softened delivery. A dreamy wisp of a chorus interpolates Snoop Dogg and Wiz Kahlifa’s “Young, Wild and Free”—an anthem for carefree good times that must’ve seemed like a distant fantasy amid the deceit that inspired “Sorry.” In this moment, Beyoncé hasn’t yet arrived at the defiance of an “I ain’t sorry.” She is, as she sings here, “Tryin’ to keep my family right,” and if she’s not quite feeling sorry for herself, certainly she’s sorry things turned out like this. “Better call Becky with the good hair/You only want me when I’m not there,” she sings, a devastating permutation of the lines ultimately inverted for maximum go-fuck-yourself impact.",articles4,"['Beyoncé’s', 'Free”—an', 'I’m']"
"DJ Paul says he and Travis Scott have talked about the lawsuit, which centers on the song’s similarity to “Tear Da Club Up”Three 6 Mafia’s DJ Paul has sued Travis Scott over his song “No Bystanders,” the Blast reports and Pitchfork can confirm. DJ Paul’s copyright infringement lawsuit claims that the Astroworld track contains a chant in which “the cadence and sound” is ”virtually identical and strikingly similar” to the titular hook from Three 6 Mafia’s 1997 song “Tear Da Club Up,” which DJ Paul co-wrote and performed. He claims Scott did not seek permission to use any portion of the Three 6 Mafia track. He’s seeking $20 million in damages.The lawsuit also points to Travis Scott’s 2019 Grammys performance of “No Bystanders” in which Scott changed the lyrics to “tear the club up” instead of the unedited version’s “fuck the club up.”DJ Paul said, via a representative, that he and Travis Scott have been in touch. “He is aware of the situation, as is his label,” DJ Paul said in a statement. Travis Scott’s representatives confirmed that the conversation took place. “Everything will be worked out accordingly with proper communication between he, Juicy J, and I,” DJ Paul said in a statement. “There is no beef, just business.”Though “Tear Da Club Up” is a Three 6 Mafia track, no other members of the group—including Juicy J and Gangsta Boo—are listed as plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

"Listen to the track belowFlying Lotus’ typically maximalist, psychedelic orbit is grounded in soul. Musings on the inevitability of death may be rendered in high-speed electronics, but FlyLo’s love of jazz and hip-hop tame the chaos and bring it down to earth. The new suite of songs “Spontaneous” and “Takashi,” which appear in sequence on his forthcoming album , offer a glimpse into FlyLo’s latest free-wheeling odyssey. “Spontaneous” is pop-minded and breezy with Little Dragon’s Yukimi Nagano cooing a headrush of romantic yearnings. “Catchin’ feelings, lost my words with you/Catch a feeling, catch a ride with you,” she sings, her voice slightly altered into a fluttering trill by what sounds like some newfangled vocal processor capable of expressing that gushy sensation of first love.“Spontaneous” flows into “Takashi,” named for Takashi Kudo of the teamLab artist collective, another boundary-pushing, multidisciplinary artist who casts wide nets for collaborations and inspirations alike. “Takashi” is a jazzy instrumental track that’s more astral-minded than “Spontaneous,” but no less vibrant. The song noodles into its own groove but there’s a nimble kind of levity here that sets it apart from FlyLo’s more ruminative past work. The brief suite is springy and light, a small key to the cosmic map of FlyLo’s latest creation.",articles4,"['Musings', 'Catch', 'FlyLo’s']"
"Mobile music-making apps have long been seen as gimmicks—something cool to futz around with during your commute, but not necessarily serious platforms made for professional musicians. That is starting to change, though; more and more apps are looking to level up, offering software that addresses the real needs of artists outside the studio. These programs lets users spark song ideas, keep better track of drafts and demos, sequence beats on the fly, tap into new synth sounds, and more. Artists with access to top equipment are even starting to embrace them: Damon Albarn made the 2011 Gorillaz album The Fall entirely using iPad apps, and the Internet guitarist Steve Lacy’s breakout EP was largely made with the mobile guitar simulator iRig.Here, we take a look at the best iPhone, iPad, and Android apps for hobbyists and professional musicians alike—programs that are worth your money and your storage space, don’t require external hardware to be used, and offer genuinely useful tools. Most of these apps let users export sounds or MIDI files, so your ideas can easily make the jump from mobile device to proper digital audio workstation (DAW) programs like Pro Tools or Logic. Some of the features listed below might sound intimidating for newbies, but don’t worry: All of these apps offer a low barrier to entry when it comes to making and recording music.$25 is a lot of cash to spend on an iPad app, but anyone looking to begin mobile music production will likely find Beatmaker a worthy investment. Sequencing MIDI notes and manipulating samples are simple; anyone accustomed to an MPC-style workflow (with the ability to quickly chop a sample across a 4x4 drum pad) or Ableton Live (with its ability to arrange music using “clips”) can easily pick it up in a manner of minutes. Beatmaker also takes full advantage of the iPad’s touch screen; a special “spectrum” controller makes it easy to play samples at different velocities, giving your beats nuance. Full integration with Dropbox means you can import your own sounds and bounce audio files of your work with ease. If you’ve never made a beat before, Beatmaker’s a good place to start.If you’re interested in a more straightforward app for audio recording, check out n-Track. Essentially a middle ground between mobile GarageBand and more “serious” desktop DAWs like Logic Pro X, n-Track is good at capturing quick guitar demos, trying different vocal arrangements, and more. There’s a bevy of processing options too, including proprietary vocal tuning and a fantastic reverb that emulates the spaces of actual rooms. Importing different audio from outside the app (like tracks and samples) is simple, and an effective input/output monitoring system makes n-Track a great mobile recording solution.Audiobus isn’t very sexy, but for on-the-fly iOS music-making, it’s essential. While you can’t actually use it to record or make beats, Audiobus acts as a host for a slew of other music apps, letting you use those other programs in conjunction with one another. With a clean interface, intuitive signal routing, and compatibility with hundreds of other App Store offerings and external MIDI devices, Audiobus lets you redirect the audio from any of your device’s synths and drum machines to a DAW app (like Beatmaker) without having to dump said audio to a computer.MV08 is a minimalistic drum machine that comes with over 200 samples, a classic XOX-style sequencer (a modern take on Roland’s iconic TR-808 and 909 units), and essential effects (EQ, distortion, reverb, delay). The iPad edition uses its extra screen real estate to display a grid-based visualizer, which makes it easier to make a longer beat; however, the iPhone version is just as versatile. Both versions let users program in odd time signatures, assign effects to trigger on specific drum hits in the sequence, and much more. Loops can easily be exported as .wav or .m4a files.ChordPolyPad allows you to map out chords to a 16-button layout, which you can then play with. It comes with a massive library of chords, the ability to write your own voicings on a musical keyboard and save pad presets, and even a function that offers up random chords for those in need of inspiration. While ChordPolyPad can’t export audio, it has full AudioBus support—so if you don’t like how your stuff sounds on the provided piano presets, you can easily play them on other synthesizers, both the physical kind and the ones on your computer screen. ChordPolyPad is a great solution for songwriters who are looking to quickly pair the melody in their heads with a basic chord structure when a keyboard isn’t handy.Ruismaker Noir allows any club kid to come up with drum patterns and scuzzy basslines worthy of a Berlin warehouse party. It’s a synthesizer/sequencer combo that can be used as a standalone app or as a plugin inside of compatible DAW programs. Instead of pads or a traditional sequencer, though, you get what looks like a series of beads and strings. Bigger beads mean louder hits, and the lower the bead is on the string, the lower the hit sounds. Techno heads and bass fiends will love how easy it is to get intricate patterns, which can then be saved, layered, and manipulated in programs like Beatmaker.Dropbox and Google Docs are tried-and-true methods for cataloging mix revisions, drafts of lyrics, songwriting credits, and other clerical aspects of music-making—but SongSpace is better. The web platform allows artists to consolidate all the digital materials they might need for a song in one place, whether it’s audio, photographs, or text. A tag system lets you sort your work by “moods” and “themes” (useful in the current playlisting era) and a simple songwriting tab makes it particularly useful for bands who want to keep track of multiple songwriters or producers who work with a bevy of artists.The cheapest app on this list won’t let you chop up samples or synthesize cool synth pads, but it might be the most useful one of the whole bunch. First published in 1975, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt’s Oblique Strategies is a deck of cards featuring commands and questions designed to spark creativity in artists of all disciplines who feel that they’ve hit a roadblock in a project. (Samples: “Use an unacceptable colour,” “Go outside. Shut the door.”) This unofficial app collects a version of the cards and serves them up in a minimalist fashion, meaning you’re never far from reading some wisdom that might help you finish your next song.",articles4,"['Damon Albarn', 'Internet', 'Steve Lacy’s', 'Android', 'Beatmaker', 'Ableton Live', 'Beatmaker', 'Dropbox', 'Beatmaker’s', 'Track', 'Beatmaker', 'Beatmaker', 'Dropbox', 'Brian Eno']"

"“It hurt to see people say, ‘Mac is trying to minimize a woman.’ Do people assume I would troll [Mitski]? That makes me sad.”Mac DeMarco has discussed his new album, mental health, and more in a new interview with Pitchfork contributor Eve Barlow for  magazine. The interview, Barlow writes, took place in Los Angeles on March 6, the day after DeMarco announced  and shared its lead single (“Nobody”), which sparked a small controversy online because of the title’s similarity to Mitski’s , which coincidentally also had a single titled “Nobody.”DeMarco said he did not anticipate much of a reaction to the album titles’ similarities, adding, “For some reason, I felt like Mitski would be chill with it, which she was.” He noted that he “talked to [Mitski] for a while” and continued:I didn’t know that one of her singles was “Nobody” till two days ago.
My manager told me and I thought, “Whoa, weird.” Even if I had known,
I don’t think I would’ve changed it. I didn’t think people were gonna
run with it that far. It’s ridiculous. It’s just music. Mitski’s song
and my song sound eons different. Most of the people talking about it
didn’t even listen to my song. With music today, [it seems] a lot of
it isn’t about music.DeMarco added that he was “not trying to troll Mitski” and that he “didn’t know who Mitski was!” After listening to , however, he said, “It’s really cool, and I think we might even cover one of the songs because it would be fun and we could try to make sense of the situation.”The interview also contains the following exchange about the #MeToo movement:As a man in music who’s been called out
for joking about rape onstage, where is your sense of responsibility
amid the #MeToo movement? Do you regret that stuff?Oh, tons of stuff. You learn. What you’re referring to... there’s a
bunch of different ways to look at that....You don’t think it was a problem?The conversations are important. I’ve learned a ton. Everyone’s
learning. It hurt yesterday to see people say, “Mac is trying to
minimize a woman.” Do people assume I would troll [Mitski]? That makes
me sad. At the same time, I know I wasn’t. Mistakes get made. I’ve
always tried to be positive. I understand that I am a man. I’m a white
man. I’m a white straight man. With this album, I just made a record.

My alcoholism stems from being scared of
playing. I don’t really drink when I’m at home. I don’t go out to
bars. It’s an “only at work” thing, which is fucked up. I like to be
with people, I like to party, I drink, I smoke. I’m just not as
interested any more. It was the only way to get through touring,
sleeping on floors every day, doing all the driving; you’re exhausted
and it’s an energizer. Now I’m getting close to 30. My hangovers last
two days. I’m sure people still like the idea of Mac being this rowdy,
fucked-up, stinky, party master guy.

"Listen to the track belowOne of the problems with living in the Anthropocene—our current epoch defined by humanity’s impact on Earth and its climate—is the difficulty of naming and shaming what exactly is destroying our planet. Climate change is such a vast and interconnected system of errors that no one event or cause can alone be held responsible. It is what theorist Timothy Morton refers to as a “hyperobject,” a concept so large and complex that it can never be properly comprehended. The ingredients of climate change are carbon emissions, political inaction, unethical consumption, and a host of other problems that are causing catastrophic weather events, rising global temperatures, and the displacement of millions of humans all around the world. Yet there is no icon of climate change, no galling and punchable face of this slow, interminable destruction that will inevitably disrupt global society by its sheer, unstoppable power.That is until last week, when novelty rapper Lil Dicky released a song called “Earth.” The song features 30 or so guests singing the voices of animals, places, people, or viruses that Lil Dicky finds funny. He convinced Ariana Grande to play a zebra, Miley Cyrus to play an elephant, Kevin Hart to play Kanye West, and Lil Yachty to play the HPV virus (for his part, Dicky is donating a “portion” of the profits from “Earth” to various charities.) The terrible song has this very specific canned quality to it as if everyone was committing to this half-baked bit under threat of blackmail. It sounds less like a charity single and more like a theme to a downmarket Disney clone made explicitly to launder money for an offshore criminal enterprise.But it is instructive, even good, that we have a song that takes the form of the hyperobject of climate change. Like the crisis it describes, “Earth” is something preventable, avoidable, created by humans, and emboldened by a vast network of power. It mimics the intractable march of manmade disaster. To sit in the ultraviolet rays of this song and watch its incomprehensibly dumb video is to feel our planet warming half a degree in seven minutes. Do you hear Justin Bieber as a baboon talking about how his “anus is huge”? Do you hear Lil Dicky saying, “We forgive you, Germany”? Do you hear Meaghan Trainor singing, “We love you, India”? What I hear is the low electrical hum of doom.",articles4,"['Earth', 'Lil Dicky', 'Lil Dicky', 'Ariana Grande', 'Kanye West', 'Lil Dicky']"

"Several architects of SoundCloud rap aren’t even old enough to rent their supercars for themselves, and yet the style has already had many permutations. At the center of this constantly expanding sound is UnoTheActivist, the squalling Atlanta rapper who debuted in 2015 with Migos-indebted grumbled flows and prototypical mumbled raps. He’s since evolved to a more fluid delivery reliant on a blabbering singsong approach, becoming one of the platform’s defining voices and among its most unheralded.On “WAYDT,” his latest SoundCloud upload, he looses melodic mush-mouth flows that settle somewhere between the yips of Playboi Carti and the bawled emo raps of Lil Uzi Vert. His liquid raps slip through slits in xylophonic riffs, as a buzzing array of ambient noise hums just beneath the surface. Mining the less decipherable sections of his verse reveals little zinger gems (“Put Chanel on your hoe out of spite”), but when he transforms it’s as if a different rapper has taken over—less nasally, more plainspoken, and more bar-oriented. “I’m strikin’ these fuck niggas out, it’s craps/I’m ridin’ around wit the K, that’s laps,” he raps. On “WAYDT,” UnoTheActivist continues to set himself apart as a premier stylist.",articles4,['Lil Uzi Vert']
"Over the past three decades, New Queer Cinema innovator Gregg Araki has established a gloriously anarchist cinematic language: sexually fluid characters who speak in arch, ultrahip, and periodically made-up lingo; garishly colorful backdrops and eye-popping cinematography; twisty storylines that encompass reptilian humanoids, doomsday prophecies, and lurid flashes of violence. All of these characteristics shine through in “Now Apocalypse,” Araki’s new sci-fi adventure comedy on Starz. The series revolves around a doe-eyed Angeleno stoner who finds himself tangled in a convoluted government plot that ropes in everyone from a Grindr one-night stand to a crackpot YouTube conspiracy theorist (played by Henry Rollins, naturally).The surreal first season of “Now Apocalypse” also boasts an inspired soundtrack, ranging from the Jesus and Mary Chain to Burial. The director is fastidious about the music in his projects and adds specific cues to scripts, with his favorite shoegaze songs forming a hazy throughline across his work. With the first season of “Now Apocalypse” now available to stream, Araki called in from L.A. to detail what music he currently has on rotation.Slowdive is my spirit animal. There are four or five Slowdive songs in “Now Apocalypse”—“Star Roving” was sort of the theme song of the pilot episode. I kept going back to them. Their new album is fantastic. When they got back together and did their reunion tour, I went both nights they played L.A., and it was literally like being in a spaceship. It took me to this completely other place, it was so overpowering. It’s just transformative. That’s what it is about [shoegaze], and particularly a certain style of shoegaze that takes that My Bloody Valentine noise and the ethereal romantic beauty of the Cocteau Twins and melds them together. Slowdive really had a big influence on me.Another band that’s in the show a lot is this group called Airiel. They’re a nu-gaze band out of Chicago and their latest album, , is super fantastic. My boyfriend listens to KCRW [storied NPR affiliate in Santa Monica] a lot, so we get a lot of new music in an old-school way. I’ll also look online or a friend will tell me about a band. It’s all through different sources, but it’s just the way it’s always been. I don’t really listen to mainstream radio. I’m not into super pop music, it’s more things I hear about and check out.The Radio Dept. have so much in their music that is right up my alley. They also have a few songs in “Now Apocalypse”—episode nine has “Token of Gratitude,” off , which is one of my all-time favorite songs of theirs. It’s also one of my favorite cues in the whole show.I always say my movies are like my kids, and I love all of them. But it’s always the most recent kid that I love most.

"Playlists were supposed to render the greatest-hits album obsolete, but it seems no one’s told the Rolling Stones. On Friday, the veteran rockers released their 4,832nd compilation, , which comes a mere seven years and one new album after their previous compilation, .  is essentially a tracklist update disguised as a new best-of collection, supplementing the group’s biggest hits from their post-ABKCO years with the tacked-on bonus tracks from their most recent best-of collections, and a smattering of blues covers from 2016’s .The new compilation distinguishes itself slightly by giving the band’s oft-derided post-’80s catalog more than a passing glance, but the very title of  serves to further entrench the popular perception of the Stones as brash, harmonica-slobbering blues-rock purists. It’s the conceit that their entire brand has been built on since day one. The press-fabricated rivalry between the Stones and the Beatles was largely waged on aesthetic terms: the bad-boy rockers versus the sophisticated pop band. But over the years, it’s come to represent the ideological poles that every rock’n’roll artist since has had to navigate—the perennial push/pull between primitivism and experimentation.The truth is, the Stones could be every bit as musically adventurous as the Beatles. But their experiments remained just that—brief trial runs that never fundamentally altered their DNA. Anytime they’ve strayed from their base to explore more au courant sounds, they’ve always been sure to hedge their bets by counterbalancing their albums with songs that reassure us how much they still love rockin’. Even their most atypical genre exercises rarely break free from traditional verse/chorus/verse schematics. The Stones are essentially like those foodies who are eager to Instagram the most exotic dish at their neighborhood’s new poke bar, only to hit up the McDonald’s drive-thru on the way home.There’s been just a handful of magical moments where they’ve transcended themselves completely. The tracks collected below would’ve been considered extreme outliers in the Stones catalog at the time of their release, and in some cases, met with outright derision by old-school fans. Now, there’s a real case to be made that they’ve aged far better than canon fodder like “Brown Sugar.” Any tune with Mick Jagger singing on it will inherently sound like the Stones, but these songs represent the band’s boldest leaps beyond their usual muddy waters.SpotifyApple MusicAppears on: The rarities collection 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: the RonettesWhile pretty much every Stones original carries the Jagger-Richards imprimatur, this 1964 outtake is credited to Richards and the band’s first manager, Andrew Loog-Oldham. Though it’s sung from the perspective of a guy who prefers to hang out with his pals over his date, “I’d Much Rather Be With the Boys” sounds tailor-made for an innocent girl group, complete with a Spector-sized backbeat and high-pitched harmonies that waft through the song like a gentle breeze. Feeling it was a touch too off-brand for a band with a nasty reputation to uphold, the Stones handed the song off to fellow Brit beat combo the Toggery Five (whose version changed the chorus to “I’d rather be out with the boys,” reportedly to defuse the original’s homoerotic undertones). A half-century later, the song finally found its rightful home when Ronnie Spector covered it (as “I’d Much Rather Be With the Girls”) for her 2016 album .Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: psychedelic BeatlesThe Stones’ relationship with psychedelia was, to put it mildly, complicated. Though their 1967 album  has held up better than its second-rate- reputation suggests, the Stones never made for the most convincing hippies; check out Mick’s thoroughly unenthused “I can’t believe my mom dressed me as a wizard for Halloween” look on the album’s front cover. Their brief flower-power flirtation did yield a few eternal classics, the most underrated of which is this non-album single from the summer of ’67. Recorded while Mick and Keith were embroiled in an infamous drug-arrest scandal, “We Love You” is psychedelia dripping with cynicism. They clang jail-cell doors and turn hippy-dippy platitudes into sneering taunts directed at the police and prosecutors. With the song’s needling piano line, buzzing mellotrons, thundering drums, and ecstatic harmonies (courtesy of an uncredited John Lennon and Paul McCartney) all sucked into a cyclonic swirl, “We Love You” is essentially the Stones’ “Tomorrow Never Knows.” (Also check “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” B-side “Child of the Moon,” aka the Stones’ “Rain.”)Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: gospel as remixed by Lee “Scratch” PerryThe Stones’ 1972 double-album messterpiece was born in a heroin-induced haze of glamor and squalor, as the Stones hid out from the taxman in the dank basement of Keith’s French Riviera mansion, letting the tape roll into the wee hours. Amid ’s burnt-spoon blend of blues, country, soul, and rockabilly, the uncanny “I Just Want to See His Face” raises you from the moldy cellar like a fleeting out-of-body experience. It’s ostensibly a church hymn, but one whose murky, mercurial production and warbling electric-piano tones make it sound like it was surreptitiously recorded at Sunday service through a pocket dial.Album: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: Astral WeeksArriving after one of the most hallowed four-album runs in rock history,  revealed the first chink in the Stones’ armor, showing early signs of the aesthetic power struggle between trendspotting and traditionalism that’s played out on pretty much every Stones record since. But the divine “Winter” exists in a universe all its own. Though seemingly cut from the same cloth as strung-out ballads like “Moonlight Mile” and “Wild Horses,” it possesses a celestial aura and stream-of-consciousness drift that elevates it to an astral plane the Stones would never strive toward again.Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: It’s tempting to say Santana, but the iconic “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking” already pulled off that trick more blatantly, so let’s go with “tropicália Steely Dan.”Though he was a member of the Stones for less than 10 percent of their existence, guitarist Mick Taylor was a crucial contributor to the band’s early-’70s canon, with soulful solos that brought a greater degree of melodic sophistication and emotional depth to even their raunchiest rockers. This Brazilian-spiced standout from the otherwise workmanlike , Taylor’s final album as a Stone, serves as a fitting epitaph for his brief but fruitful tenure in the band. The Stones could always jam with the best of ‘em, but Taylor’s graceful extended fretboard workout pushes them to uncharted realms of psych-jazz improvisation.Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: Neu! 75“Shattered” is probably the most well-known Stones song included here, making regular appearances on past compilations and set lists. But that doesn’t make it any less of a bizarre anomaly in their canon. The song was famously part of the Stones’ response to punk, but in contrast to fellow  aggressors like “Lies” and “Respectable,” it doesn’t rock in a typically trashy garage-band fashion. Rather, the dry, vacuum-sealed production and relentless motorik minimalism of “Shattered” stake the middle ground between CBGB and the Autobahn, while the band’s stoner-doo-wop backing vocals goad Jagger into the most hysterical performance of his career. (For more quality Stones-on-punk snarl, check out ’s “Where the Boys Go,” in which Mick goes full Pete Shelley.)Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: peak hour at the Paradise GarageIf the Stones’ 1978 club crossover hit “Miss You” was the sound of Mick cooly slinking into the discotheque at sunset, the more intoxicated “Dance Pt. 1” finds him still on the floor several hours later, soaked in sweat, grinding his teeth, and jabbering nonsense into random strangers’ ears.Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: chillwaveWhile  marked the Stones’ exile from beat street, the album’s ballad-heavy second side still gave Jagger plenty of opportunities to flex his smooth falsetto for a slow dance. Amid the canon of mellow Stones songs, none are as strange and sublime as “Heaven.” Atop a featherweight snare-rim rhythm, Jagger’s eerily airy voice blurs into a vapor trail of guitar lines and wind-chimed mysticism, yielding a song that’s as alluring and ambiguous as a desert mirage.Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: an Arthur Russell 12-inchIntimations of violence were always baked into the Stones’ most powerful songs, but as their music got slicker and more streamlined, their attempts at provocation became more flagrant—and, in some cases, more laughable. “Too Much Blood” has the distinction of boasting both Jagger’s most cringe-worthy vocal turn (in the form of a spoken-word freestyle about cannibalistic serial killers and  hot takes) and one of the Stones’ most hypnotic grooves—a strobe-lit, proto-house pulse that cranked up the cowbell-clanking freakiness even more in Arthur Baker’s companion dub remix.Appears on: 
The closest the Stones ever got to sounding like: yacht rockEven the most committed Stones fan has to concede that the band’s catalog stopped feeling vital from the mid-1980s onward, as they settled into their role as elder statesmen of the stadium circuit and released increasingly sporadic albums. To the group’s credit, they resisted the slide into syrupy dentist-office pop that knee-capped many of their fellow ’60s-rock survivors during the ’80s. However, this sleek mid-tempo ballad from the better-than-you-might-remember  suggests an adult-contemporary Stones might not have been such a bad thing. With its glassy piano strokes, new-agey acoustic picking, and shoulder-rubbing “ooh ooh oohs,” “Almost Hear You Sigh” is just begging for a cover by Bon Hornsby.",articles4,"['Playlists', 'The Stones', 'Mick Jagger', 'Toggery Five', 'Mick’s', 'Paul McCartney', 'Mick Taylor', 'Taylor’s', 'The Stones', 'Taylor’s', 'Autobahn', 'Jagger’s', 'Arthur Baker']"

"Although tickets won’t go on sale April 22, as planned, organizers state the fest will not be canceledWoodstock 50, a new event to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the historic 1969 music festival, is slated to take place August 16-18 at the Watkins Glen International speedway in upstate New York. Tickets were due to go on sale April 22, but as  and  report, the on-sale date has been pushed back, with no exact reason given for the delay. One possible hiccup, however, is that, as of Friday, April 19, the Woodstock 50 organizers have yet to acquire a mass gathering permit from the New York State Department of Health (DOH), Pitchfork can confirm.According to Tim O’Hearn, administrator of Schuyler County (which includes the village of Watkins Glen), Watkins Glen International filed a mass gathering permit application to DOH on Monday, April 15. “The health department is reviewing to determine if a conditional permit may be issued that would allow for ticket sales to commence,” he told Pitchfork. “At this point there is no on-sale date set.”New York State DOH spokesperson Erin Silk told Watkins Glen-area newspaper  in March that a conditional permit would allow for ticket sales to commence during the full permit review and approval process. Without a permit or conditional permit in place, tickets cannot be sold.Silk issued the following statement to Pitchfork on April 15: “The Department continues to work closely with the applicant and event promoters to assure that all requirements are met for a mass gathering permit before ticket sales begin.” At this time, it is unclear when a permit is expected to be delivered. When reached on April 21, Silk stated that DOH is in “the process of completing its review” of the permit application.Michael Lang, one of the organizers of the original festival, is the promoter behind Woodstock 50. He is the co-owner of Woodstock Ventures, which owns the original trademark to the fest. In a statement to , Lang said that Woodstock 50 will not be canceled, calling fears of cancelation “rumors.” Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Woodstock 50 for further comment.Update (04/25, 11:04 a.m. ET): A representative for Woodstock 50 has confirmed the ticket on-sale delay and issued the following statement to Pitchfork:Woodstock 50 has delayed its on sale while we refine logistical plans

"Perhaps more than anything else, ""Stranger Things"" is famous for taking 1980s nostalgia to meta new extremes—so it makes some kind of sense that the creators of the Netflix hit would eventually get sued for being derivative. But it wasn’t Steven Spielberg or Stephen King who called them out. In the spring of 2018, a previously obscure filmmaker named Charlie Kessler claimed that “Stranger Things” creators Matt and Ross Duffer flat-out stole his idea.Fast-forward to this week, when a California judge cleared the way for a trial on Kessler’s claim, that “Stranger Things” breaches an “implied contract” he had with the Duffer brothers. Kessler claims that he presented a pitch for a feature-length movie based on his 2012 short film  to the Duffers, with the mutual understanding that they wouldn’t use his ideas without paying him. But just because the claim, which the Duffers have repeatedly denied, has now headed to a jury trial doesn’t automatically mean Kessler should be prepping his Chief Hopper Dance. According to several entertainment lawyers who spoke with Pitchfork, Kessler still has his work cut out for him when the case goes to trial on May 6. Nevertheless, his lawsuit might spawn its own copycats.Kessler says his “presentation” happened on April 21, 2014. Left unstated in the original lawsuit was the fact that this date fell during the Tribeca Film Festival, where the Duffers claim that all he did was talk casually with them for 10 to 15 minutes at a cocktail party.“This whole thing is a tire fire,” says Meredith Rose, policy counsel at Public Knowledge, a nonprofit that advocates free expression. “You cannot copyright a concept.” To that end, Kessler isn’t suing the Duffers for copyright infringement. He’s suing them for breaking their implied contract. “In human speak, this translates to, ‘We talked, we all walked away thinking we’d committed to partnering up for this project, the other guys did not partner up with me, and I think they used the ideas I gave them in that conversation anyway,’” says Rose. Proving all that, especially the part about everyone walking away thinking they’d committed to partnering up, “is insanely hard to do,” she adds. “It’s why you always get your contracts in writing.”When Los Angeles Superior Judge Michael Stern ruled earlier this week that the case could proceed to trial, that wasn’t any indication of whether he thought the case might actually  at trial. “These types of cases are so fact-specific that judges are typically hesitant to rule without a jury to decide the facts issues,” says Mattias Eng, a lawyer at entertainment firm King, Holmes, Paterno & Soriano. Essentially, the judge punted it over to a jury to figure out whether the Duffers really broke a deal with Kessler.If the case does come down to a cocktail party pitch, Kessler might have trouble convincing many people that’s the same as a binding contract. “Kessler has a very steep hill to climb to convince a jury that he shared his ideas with the Duffer brothers under sufficiently clear circumstances,” says Jeff Becker, who heads the entertainment practice at another law firm, Swanson, Martin & Bell.Then there’s the matter that the “concept” Kessler is claiming as his own is based on an old conspiracy theory called the Montauk Project, which holds that there were secret U.S. government experiments involving psychological warfare, time travel, and teleportation at a military base on Montauk, Long Island. “This further undermines Kessler’s claim of originality,” Becker says. “Even before ‘Stranger Things,’ there was the , a film that was also inspired by the Montauk Project.”More broadly, Kessler’s lawsuit might, in its own way, prove as inspirational as he claims his ideas were to the Duffers. “The judge has set the court system up for many more weak idea theft cases by allowing this case to go to trial,” says Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris Law, which focuses on intellectual property. “People can’t even have casual conversations without worrying about implied contracts and lawsuits. It creates a fearful environment where the establishment refuses to hear out the newcomers for fear of being sued.” Bill Hochberg, a lawyer at entertainment firm Greenberg Glusker, agrees that this new precedent could stifle creativity in the world of TV and film: “If every time someone came up to you at a party with an interesting idea, you had to stop and enter into a non-disclosure agreement, it wouldn’t be a very fun party.”The immediate outcome of Kessler’s case against the Duffers may well be a settlement. (A jury trial, Hochberg notes, is “an expensive crap shoot.”) But whether the influence can be traced back to this case or not, the battle over whether “Stranger Things” was ripped off from another filmmaker certainly won’t be the last of its kind. “These kinds of fights are both really common and really, really difficult to prove procedurally,” says Rose, of Public Knowledge. “People talk through their ideas with other people. People pitch other people. But there’s usually no formal or even contemporaneous record of those conversations, so proving exactly what was said at the time, and exactly how each party interpreted it, is basically a nightmare scenario for a fact finder.” Sounds almost like the type of argument someone might dream about after a night spent binging “Stranger Things.”",articles4,"['Stranger Things', 'Stephen King', 'Meredith Rose', 'Mattias Eng', 'Holmes', 'Essentially', 'Duffers', 'Public Knowledge']"

"Listen to the track belowDJ Koze knows the power of a good loop. On last year’s misty-eyed disco-house anthem “Pick Up,” he sank his teeth into a simple two-bar phrase—a winsome swirl of strings and guitar layered over a streamlined drum groove—and shook it with abandon, like an overjoyed dog with a favorite rag.He does something similar on a new remix of Gerry Read’s forthcoming single “It’ll All Be Over,” due out on Koze’s Pampa Records on May 10. He cuts right to the chase, zooming in on the song’s refrain and blowing it up until it fills the frame, then lavishing attention on every lively detail: jazzy guitar licks, blocky Rhodes chords, unstoppable cowbells, even a brief outburst from what sounds like a particularly mournful kazoo. With a chorus like this, who needs a verse? “It’ll all be over,” a small choir sings, over and over again, in wistful harmony. Much as he did with Gladys Knight’s heartbroken lines on “Pick Up,” Koze wrings every last drop of bittersweet out of the song’s vocal hook—dropping it out, bringing it back, teasing the listener on, and keeping the song’s promised finale dancing forever just out of reach. The lyrics prophesy sweet release, but Koze gives us something even better than a happy ending: a delirious, life-affirming, never-ending .",articles4,"['Gerry Read’s', 'Gladys Knight’s']"

"Listen to the track below“Power Is Power” sounds like someone trying to fake their way through a conversation about “Game of Thrones.” Crowns and queens. Fire and ice. Something something stabbed in the heart. “I was born of the ice and snow/With the winter wolves and the dark, alone,” the Weeknd sings, channeling Jon Snow, or maybe Robert Plant. As a work of vapid and self-serious fantasy pop that carries only trace amounts of what’s special about fantasy or pop, this  alliance with SZA and Travis Scott is unadventurous to the point of passivity—everything the show, at its best, isn’t.The song takes its title from one of the most enduring, delicious moments from the show’s second season. As the drab synth tones drip into glitchy drum programming, each member of the trio takes a turn on the Iron Throne, grasping at this elusive flex. They want to be Queen Cersei Lannister, witty and in control, but really they’re the bumbling footsoldiers of the Queen’s Guard: beholden to the authority of their overlord. Their lazy and ultimately empty allusions to the show and its plotting are bogged down by performances as unfeeling and mindless as a wight plowed through with a burning sword.The Weeknd and SZA are no strangers to switching on autopilot for “music inspired by” Hollywood behemoths. Both had turns producing generic, lifeless singles for the Marvel Studios juggernaut . Both are better than this. There are but a few landmark events left in our shrinking monoculture, and operating on behalf of huge brands can cause some artists to lose sight of themselves in the face of so much IP.

"For reasons that include war, a flood, and the pesky reality of birth order, there are few photos of me as a child, and even fewer as a baby. There are definitely no home videos. I am often grateful that I have little ambition to become a public figure, for one, because there wouldn’t be much material to fold into a documentary, as has become common these days. It can be difficult to affirm the memories and contexts that shaped you without having tangible proof of them, as if you’re just taking the world’s word that you exist. I’ve always vowed to correct this in adulthood, and I’ve mostly failed. Perhaps that’s why I’m especially touched by Beyoncé’s hardcore commitment to archiving, both personal and professional.That instinct is on full display in her new Netflix special, . The movie is part traditional concert film, part documentary—an effective hybrid genre that Beyoncé first experimented with six years ago, with the HBO release . While that doc focused on the run-up to a series of 2012 shows in Atlantic City and the experience of being pregnant with her daughter Blue,  commemorates the grueling preparations for her historic Coachella 2018 performance, in the wake of her twins’ birth. Insightful moments from Beyoncé’s four-month training and rehearsal schedule are included, drawn from what must be hundreds of hours of alternately mundane and thrilling material. appears deeply personal, but only in the effective, manicured way Beyoncé has perfected in recent years. There are specifics about her complicated pregnancy with Rumi and Sir, a relatable glimpse into the nature of her marriage and self-image, and behind-the-scenes access to her process as, to quote her husband, the world’s best performer. Under her own direction and executive producing, there are no traditional interviews; Beyoncé appears to have delivered her commentary via voice memos, her narration supplementing cuts of analog footage. The whole thing is meticulously edited.At times  illuminates Beyoncé’s work ethic and leadership style, but also her intention behind the performance: to celebrate HBCUs in particular and black cultural expression in general, bolstered by quotes from Toni Morrison, W.E.B. Du Bois, and more. In 2013, during the  era, Beyoncé was coming into her feminism, finding language for the gender inequalities she had perceived throughout her life and career. Now, she’s become more specific, boldly centering her own cultural heritage.Of course, the performance itself is flawless and inspired. Across two hours, Beyoncé reinterprets dozens of songs from her 22-year career, spanning Destiny’s Child classics, beloved solo material, and recent guest appearances that show off her underappreciated skills as a rapper. There’s an emotional reunion with Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, and JAY-Z shows up for a bit, sweetly fumbling his way through a couple of their collaborations. But the musical arrangements, in service of the “homecoming” theme, are unreal; the show is a baptism of horns, strings, and musical references including Nina Simone, the black national anthem, and O.T. Genasis. Beyoncé generously connects the dots between decades of black culture with what can best be described as extreme swag. Who else could turn the phrase “suck on my balls” into a moment of cultural significance?As ever, Beyoncé opens the door to her life but only allows viewers to stand in the entryway. The nuts-and-bolt details that I truly want, that fans have come to expect from other celebrities, are unsurprisingly absent from . As much as her creative instincts, obsession with detail, and peerless commitment are undeniable, much of her power comes from the clearly ingenious infrastructure that is Parkwood Entertainment, the management and production company whose employees have helped execute her vision for a decade now. How did she build it? Does she have one assistant or three? What time does she wake up? Does she agree that email is dead? How does she manage her schedule? Who handles her logistics, and what can we learn from them? What many of us want from Beyoncé, after all, is to show us how we can become more like our own versions of Beyoncé.That will likely never happen, but she did offer a rare, fascinating clue in a 2013  profile, which noted that Beyoncé has an elaborate, painstakingly updated personal archive. Writer Amy Wallace described a “long, narrow room [in Manhattan] that contains the official Beyoncé archive, a temperature-controlled digital-storage facility.” Its contents form a nearly complete record of her image: years and years of photographs, interviews, shows, PhotoBooth confessionals, and footage taken by a dedicated visual director. The archive is said to be modeled on NBC’s library, complete with “labeling, date-stamping, and cross-referencing.” An unearthed job posting for Beyoncé’s archivist asked for “experience with servers and enterprise class storage and be able to recommend hardware solutions.”Nearly 15 years ago, before livestreams and selfies became everyday modes of communication, Beyoncé began shooting “practically her every waking moment, up to 16 hours a day, since 2005.” Over time, people reacted snidely to this news.  described it as narcissistic,  called her a hoarder. Some people who didn’t have immediate concerns about the representation of their own likeness had neither grasped her cultural significance nor the prescient genius of archiving your own existence. Tess Webre, then an intern at the National Digital Information Infrastructure and Preservation Program at the Library of Congress, took another tack. “In an era where every celebrity is expected to have social media consultants, yogis, personal assistants, pet groomers and every other kind of service in their entourage, there is a noticeable lack of archivists,” she wrote in a post on the library’s official blog. “Why is that?”Many of us have made the assumption that life’s digital ephemera will be collected on our behalf by the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world. And while tech companies are motivated to profit off our data, they also have shown no real desire to preserve it. Our lives are stored in sequences of ones and zeros, and they can disappear in an instant, as platforms cycle in and out of relevance. Just ask anyone who has tried to find an erstwhile Angelfire page, or their Myspace uploads, or work they published on a now-shuttered, unarchived site like MTV Iggy. It’s an untenable form of optimism to expect such material to persist.Of course, it’s a slightly different scenario for celebrities, whose days are documented by paparazzi and professional videographers, and whose careers facilitate more built-in archiving than the average person. But still: “It is commendable that this celebrity has taken responsibility for her own digital assets and it should be viewed as an act of empowerment,” Webre continued. “She wishes to control the destiny of her records and understands the work necessary for this. The employment of her digital archivist proves that maintenance of digital materials is a worthwhile investment.” confirms what many of us have known about Beyoncé for years: She is a phenomenal artist. But it also points to the breadth of her strategy, that she does not take shortcuts, and that she understands the world in a way that few of her peers do. The act of documenting her life and work means that she controls her image and how it’s used, that she can track her growth in the short- and long term, and that it is crucial to be an agent in the making of your own representation. Perhaps informed by the way too many brilliant women are erased from history, Beyoncé intervened on her own behalf, quietly out-thinking the media and the music industry. Her legacy is as secure as her archive.",articles4,"['I’m', 'Beyoncé’s', 'Beyoncé’s', 'Kelly Rowland', 'Michelle Williams', 'JAY-Z', 'O.T.

"Lizzo is good at many things: singing, rapping, twerking… and playing the flute.  The very presence of a chubby black woman performing in front of thousands, wearing extravagant show costumes, proudly throwing her ass in a circle, and simply not giving a fuck, is pretty radical in and of itself. But there’s also never been a pop star who can do all that  virtuosically shred on the flute .A classically trained flautist, the artist born Melissa Jefferson first picked up the instrument 20 years ago to play in her Houston junior high marching band. She first started getting recognition for her flute skills on her 2016 song “Coconut Oil,” but really started going viral when she shared a cover of Future’s “Mask Off” the following year. Since then, she’s uploaded dozens more videos of her mind-blowing performances; the more famous she gets, the more she breaks preconceptions that flautists are only band geeks, black tie-clad first chairs at the Philharmonic, or old prog rock dudes. “One day there’s gonna be a person that fucks up the flute and twerk way harder than me and I’m gonna be so proud I paved the way for that bitch,” she recently tweeted.In anticipation of this week’s release of Lizzo’s new album , we’ve gathered, in chronological order, the most impressive—and often hilarious—Lizzo flute footage. From a cover of Kendrick Lamar’s “Big Shot” to a showdown with Ron Burgundy, these are Lizzo’s best flute moments.
            Loading
          The first Lizzo flute video most people saw was her March 2017 octave-jumping cover of Future’s “Mask Off.” In her Instagram caption, she indicates that she was inspired by the Twitter user @BonafideTye, a fellow black female flautist who slayed her take on the flute-sampling Metro Boomin-produced beat and sparked a trend of “Mask Off” instrumental covers.

          In a handful of clips that can be referred to as the “Suck My Dick” series, Lizzo delivers a grouping of crazy classical runs before pausing and singing “suck my diiiick” in an operatic voice. “The only clout I have to offer is my self worth,” she wrote in the caption of a September 2018 clip. “When you come to my shows there won’t be a viral moment, but there will be a real moment.” Lizzo doesn’t make flute videos for the internet fame. She makes them because she loves showing her full Lizzo-ness to the world.https://twitter.com/lizzo/status/1053517705037471744In October 2018, Lizzo posted a video of her playing the flute at hyperspeed to a reworking of Kendrick Lamar’s “Big Shot,” only stopping to spit out a ferocious “BITCH!” Perfectly on beat, she finished a rapid trill and quickly launched into the viral “Shoot” dance in sync with her backup dancers. She captioned the clip: “HAVE U EVER SEEN A BITCH PLAY FLUTE THEN HIT THE SHOOT?” The internet collectively realized that the answer was “no.”

          New Orleans’ Voodoo Music and Arts Experience took place on the weekend before Halloween last year. For the occasion, Lizzo went all out by performing dressed as Sailor Moon (with her backup dancers dressed as all the other Sailor Moon characters). In this video, Lizzo is trilling on top of a trap beat while a Sailor Mars-dressed dancer goes off behind her.

          When rumors came out that Disney was working on a live-action version of , some Lizzo fans pointed out that the singer’s evil villain laugh was proof enough that she could be an amazing contender to play Ursula. To continue this “Lizzo for Ursula” campaign, in a November 2018 video, Lizzo dressed up as the sea witch and started playing a few notes of “Under the Sea” on the flute. But immediately, the “Knuck If You Buck” beat starts, she does a mini-twerk, and plays along.
            Loading
          In a November 2018 message to her haters, Lizzo addresses allegations that her flute-playing videos are doctored. “There are people who are doubting that I’m classically trained flautist, that these videos are fake,” she begins. “I just really think that that’s a sign that I’m finally popping! I’m going to celebrate by actually putting my flute together and actually blowing notes out of it, so you hoes can shut the fuck up.” She then explains the details of her particular flute (which she named “Sasha Flute” after Beyonce’s alter-ego) before playing “her favorite note of the whole scale”: F natural for “fuck y’all.”

          In this clip from January 2019 of Lizzo performing at a Los Angeles strip club, she plays a ripping flute solo during a breakdown of “Juice.” She’s crouching on the stage with bills strewn around her, a backup dancer holding the microphone up to her mouth. As soon as she releases the final note of the solo, Lizzo grabs the mic and launches straight into a wailing ad-lib. Since that appearance, Lizzo has brought that solo to “Ellen,” the GLAAD Awards, “The Today Show,” and “TRL.”While appearing on Jessica Williams and Phoebe Robinson’s “2 Dope Queens” HBO special in February, Lizzo demonstrated her trademark flute and twerk. While Williams and Robinson watched on, mouths with flutes in hand, Lizzo turned her backside to the audience and somehow shook her booty to the exact same tempo as her trills.

          Also in February, Lizzo uploaded a cover in honor of the 20th anniversary of Juvenile’s “Back That Azz Up.” Standing in a beautiful Amsterdam plaza with her friends, wearing a green ombre wig, Lizzo starts playing the synth part to the classic twerk anthem, awaiting the beat to drop. And when it does, they all shake their asses at once.Lizzo is the hottest flautist in pop culture since Will Ferrell’s Ron Burgundy character set a flute on fire in . To prove it, in March, she recreated that iconic scene from the 2004 comedy in a sketch video in which she casually rips out a rendition of her single “Juice” at a smoky jazz bar. (Este Haim makes a cameo). And yes, she sucks up a bystander’s margarita with the flute and then ignites the end of the barrel. The elaborate, extremely accurate  replication was Lizzo’s latest move in an ongoing “jazz flute duel” that she challenged Ferrell to last November.

Martine’s studio has served as a frequent recording spot for the Decemberists, who have used the space throughout its multiple locations and adaptations; in Martine’s home basement, a barn in Happy Valley, Oregon, and a studio space in North Portland. Sadly, a new, in-progress iteration of Flora was robbed of approximately $70,000 worth of equipment.In an email to the Decemberists’ mailing list, Colin Meloy has announced that he and his band will play “what may be our one and only show in 2019” at Portland’s Crystal Ballroom alongside Blind Pilot and “a few more as-yet unannounced guests.” “We’re determined to help Tucker get back on his feet, reclaim or replace the stolen gear, and finish out this latest and greatest iteration of Flora Recording and Playback,” Meloy wrote. Find his full statement below, and grab tickets to the concert here.Adored Mailing List Recipients,We’ve got some good news and some bad news.The bad news is that our friend Tucker Martine’s studio, Flora, was robbed last month. The burglars made off with about $70,000 worth of guitars, microphones, and various pieces of gear, much of it irreplaceable. The studio was still a work in progress when the robbery occurred; Tucker had just bought the location, had moved all his stuff over from the old Flora, and was in the process of finishing the build-out of what was to be Flora’s fifth and hopefully final residence. You can imagine what kind of hit that would be, both financially and emotionally. Tucker and his family are heartbroken, trying to move on and finish the studio, all the while dealing with an insurance company that has been difficult in the aftermath of the robbery.As you likely know, The Decemberists' relationship with Tucker and Flora goes way back; he co-produced The Crane Wife with Chris Walla in 2006. We went on to make three more records with Tucker, using whichever iteration of Flora was assembled at the time: Flora was Tucker’s home basement; it was a barn in Happy Valley, OR, where he’d moved most of his outboard gear for one recording session; it was, later, a well-appointed studio in North Portland. We did one-off recordings, demos, and EPs at Flora with Tucker. I recorded two audiobooks, the second and third Wildwood books, at Flora. Most of my vocal takes that are currently out there in the world on songs and records were recorded on the microphones that were stolen from Flora a month ago.So that’s the bad news.The good news is this: We’re determined to help Tucker get back on his feet, reclaim or replace the stolen gear, and finish out this latest and greatest iteration of Flora Recording and Playback. We’ve decided to reach out to some friends and organize a benefit concert.In what may be our one and only show in 2019, The Decemberists are performing at the Crystal Ballroom on June 3rd with Blind Pilot and a few more as-yet unannounced guests. All proceeds from this concert will go to a fund to help defray the costs of the theft at Flora. If you’d like to support further, there’s also a Gofundme campaign underway. Any amount helps!We’d love it if you came out and showed support for Tucker, his family, and his studio.Yours,
Colin Meloy

"Listen to the track belowIt should come as a surprise to precisely no one that Madonna rides the Latin pop wave for her first single in four years. From “La Isla Bonita” to , Madonna’s occasional flirtation with Latin America over the years has yielded some career highlights. That, combined with the fact that Madge practically invented the now-common pop-star move of vampiring all that is young and hot from album to album, leads us down to Medellín, Colombia. The reggaeton singer Maluma guides the way, carrying the sultry, dembow-tinged song with his whispered Spanish responses to his duet partner’s eerily still verses. On a track that opens with Madonna counting off a cha-cha-chá like she’s in an ASMR video, Maluma stands out, via actual singing, as the heart and soul really selling this fever dream of young love. The chorus pops off into a joyous celebration because of him.“Medellín” may end up being a bigger moment for Maluma than Madonna, but as far as the pop icon’s semi-recent cool-hunting exploits go, the song sits closer to the top of the heap than the bottom. It is more sonically restrained than her EDM phase, leaving room in the production for tactile details that mostly work (though the echo  Auto-Tune on her vocals is a bit much). Madonna has struggled at times in her late career to find a balance between campy bangers and more mature balladry; “Medellín” is something of a sexy, stylish middle ground. Of course, she couldn’t let a whole song this decade go by without at least one cringe-y moment. “We built a cartel just for love,” she declares, turning the titular city’s violent drug trafficking history into lyrical myopia.",articles4,"['Madonna’s', 'Madge', 'Madonna', 'Auto-Tune', 'Madonna']"

"Chance the Rapper called it “the greatest show to ever happen.” Adele performed a suite of living-room dance tributes. And Janelle Monáe tweeted in reverence: “You continuously make me feel so proud to be a Black woman & artist. We must protect you at all costs!” Now, in the concert film , Beyoncé has directed and executive produced a testament to her historic Beychella performance from last year, as well as its physically and spiritually taxing eight-month gestation. As you delve into the Netflix film and its accompanying live album, here are a few things to know. largely pays tribute to the monumental feat that was Beychella by following the modern concert film format: bursts of multi-camera footage from the show, flashes of behind-the-scenes humor, and just enough voice-over vulnerability to carry you along on the artist’s journey. In another sense, though, it’s a spectacle in its own right, living up to Bey’s goal, as she says here, to make people “feel like they’re watching magic.”Canny editing is key. Bey and her 200-strong backing troupe wore whole new wardrobes for each of their two Coachella 2018 performances—yellow jerseys turned to pink, and even Bey’s Nefertiti cape got a studded silver overhaul. By splicing footage from both sets together,  throws the visuals into dramatic contrast. So meticulous is the choreography that, throughout the nearly two-and-a-half-hour film, seamless transitions seem to occur in the same shot. The illusion of costume changes happening before your eyes, as if between frames of film, is testament to the inch-perfect production.Beychella marked the culmination of Bey’s mission to advance visions of Black unity on the stage. But it was also a staggering musical achievement. From the triumphal brass to the whiplash beat pivots and her upcycling of deep cuts like “Me, Myself and I,”  plays less like Bey’s Greatest Hits—a generally spiritless concept in pop music—than a wholesale reinvention of her catalog.The entire show warrants repeat viewings, if only to study the crowd’s delirious faces. A personal favorite: Pause around the 1:49:50 mark—toward the end of “Run the World (Girls)”—and gaze upon a sea of adults turned into giddy kids, their faces so joyfully contorted that, without context, they could be either blissed-out angels or horrified characters in some bloody Renaissance painting. Plus: Solange’s dance showdown is still a delight, and the siblings’ second-weekend stage tumble makes the final cut here.Footage of the concert is broken up by behind-the-scenes interludes that give rare insight into one of the most shielded personalities in pop. In rehearsals, Beyoncé hashes out schedules and leads dancers in prayer, or bounds into uptempo choreography mid-step. One montage shows her family and friends—including Pharrell, Cardi B, and SZA—frolicking with her at parties. But these in-between moments sometimes strike a more reflective tone: In several scenes, Bey addresses the cancellation of her slated 2017 Coachella set due to pregnancy, which she describes as “unexpected.”“I was 218 pounds the day I gave birth,” she says, over hospital footage in which she cradles her newborn twins. “I had an extremely difficult pregnancy. I had high blood pressure, I developed toxemia, preeclampsia, and, in the womb, one of my baby’s heartbeat paused a few times, so I had to get an emergency C-section.” After returning to rehearsals, she describes working 15-hour days—with occasional breastfeeding breaks—while on a diet that strictly prohibited bread, sugar, dairy, meat, fish, and alcohol.Elsewhere, we see Bey directing the film itself in the same giant hall that housed rehearsals for the show. In one striking scene, she sternly tells her film crew that the dynamic boom-clap-rumble of the stage floor “is not translating on film.” Frustrated, she adds: “And until I see some of my notes applied, it doesn’t make sense for me to make more.” The camera zooms in on JAY-Z beside her, gazing with exhausted awe. Once she’s finished, an understanding voice off-camera tells the superstar couple: “All right. Have a good anniversary.”The film’s first break from concert footage plays under a Nina Simone monologue in which she speaks of her responsibility to Black listeners. Simone’s job, she says, is “to somehow make them curious enough, or persuade them, by hook or crook, to get more aware of themselves, and where they came from, and what they are into, and what is already there, and to bring it out.” Bey’s complementary philosophy is the substance of , as well as of her family life: In one adorable scene, Blue Ivy sings the Black National Anthem, “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” hiding her face with her elbow.As Bey puts it in the film: “When I decided to do Coachella, instead of me pulling out my flower crown”—she chuckles—“it was more important that I brought  culture to Coachella.” In addition to the concert’s musical nods to Black pioneers including Sister Nancy and Fela Kuti, the film laces in quotes and voiceovers from icons such as Alice Walker, Audre Lorde, W. E. B. DuBois, and Toni Morrison.At one point, the voice of Maya Angelou offers advice to the next generation: “Tell the truth, to yourself first, and to the children. Live in the present. Don’t deny the past.... And know the charge on you is to make this country more than it is today.” As the camera returns to whooping California crowds, the implication is that Bey has done exactly that: On those nights, in that desert, she made the country more than it was.",articles4,"['Chance the Rapper', 'Adele', 'Beychella', 'Pharrell', 'Cardi B', 'Have', 'Simone’s', 'Blue Ivy', 'Every Voice', 'Sister Nancy', 'Fela Kuti', 'Alice Walker', 'Maya Angelou']"
"Listen to the track belowThe Welsh singer-songwriter Cate Le Bon’s last couple of releases—her 2016 album  and 2018’s , from her duo DRINKS, with Tim Presley—have been deceptively prickly affairs. Le Bon has a cool, dulcet voice imbued with the cryptic poise of a sighing aristocrat, or an Edward Gorey character; her early work wrapped clean-toned guitar around muted moods and harmonies. But she has increasingly gravitated toward tone clusters that bristle with dissonance, and her arrangements tend to resemble Tinker Toys: round, innocuous forms with brightly colored sticks jutting out at improbable angles.She walks back the strangeness slightly on “Home to You,” the latest single from her forthcoming album . Plucked electric bass and soft chimes situate the song squarely within the sounds of the 1960s that she loves so much; a mixture of staccato pulses and gently worn textures, it bounces like the coils of a boarding-house sofa. Aside from a chilly trace of new wave in the song’s flanged guitar counterpoints, it’s a cozy, reassuring sound, smooth as a slow dance on hardwood floors. But her lyrics are anything but familiar. They read like someone’s dream journal with every other page torn out, or half the words rendered illegible—by tears, perhaps, or droplets of old tea. Ironic, given that it’s a song about memories.“Home to you/Is a neighborhood in the night kitchen/Home to you/Is atrocity in the town,” she sings, with the quiet determination of a clairvoyant tracing haunted blueprints. She seeks out the source of the disturbance one fragmentary word at a time, finally homing in on a refrain—“Last time for all time gone”—that cycles like a song in the round, its parts jumbled, the time forever out of joint. Even at her most seemingly straightforward, Le Bon can’t resist prying up the floorboards, mischievously throwing everything ever so slightly out of whack.",articles4,"['Cate Le Bon’s', 'Le Bon', 'Le Bon']"
"There is a cluster of highways you have to pass through to get to the center of Sheffield, England. Built in 1961, this knot of roads is notorious for trapping drivers and then spitting them out all over town. In 2003, my old band, the Walkmen, got stuck in this three-mile loop and went around, no joke,  looking for a club called The Leadmill. Each time, we went a little slower in front of a sign diagramming the system’s shape, arguing a little more pointedly. A few more times around, and they would have had to put us on the sign.This type of nonsense doesn’t happen to bands much anymore, thanks to smartphones and GPS. At the very least, getting lost is now measured in minutes rather than hours or whole afternoons. But there was a time, not so long ago, when you could go wildly off course and drive to Chicago by accident—which we actually did once.I don’t miss driving in circles, but I do miss the slapstick comedy of touring. It could be one of the best parts. The Walkmen wedged our van in the Drive Thru Tree in Leggett, California, causing a traffic jam on Drive Thru Tree Road. Spoon frontman Britt Daniel tells me about finishing a tour in San Diego and, five minutes into a two-day drive back to Texas, accidentally getting in the line to Mexico, eventually crossing into Tijuana at about 2 a.m. When the band turned around, U.S. Customs asked, “How long were you in Mexico?” To which they responded,“Ten minutes?” Their bus was searched top to bottom.Tim Kingsbury of Arcade Fire recalls losing his red-headed, 6-foot-5 bandmate Richard Reed Parry on multiple occasions. In 2004, on their first tour through the South, they had a day off in Austin and went swimming in a nearby spring. The hour to meet at the van arrived, but Parry wasn’t around. Time passed, and folks might have been getting annoyed when Parry finally wandered up, a little dazed. Apparently, he had been swimming in the lake when a snake swam by on the surface of the water. Impressed, he followed it across the lake and then down along a dirt path. Eventually, the snake led him to a beautiful little waterfall. The snake hopped back into the water, and Parry looked up to see two girls in bikinis, taking pictures of each other. They asked Parry to take some pictures of them, and he said yes.The days of touring modestly without phones and GPS could inspire a sense of purpose. Alex Scally of Beach House describes how he used to happily print out a little booklet of MapQuest maps for each tour, studying highways and byways in advance. Like him, I enjoyed plotting routes and taking an interest in where we were traveling through, and we both agree that we miss having a little less information in general. Cities rarely looked the way you expected them to. We rolled into Cincinnati for the first time in 1994 and found ourselves in a neighborhood, Over-the-Rhine, that looked shockingly similar to Manhattan’s Lower East Side, where we had started 10 hours earlier. The first time we went to Los Angeles we drove through the entire thing without realizing it—it just wasn’t what we thought it would be.Ultimately, though, it was the threat of genuine disaster that made for the most remarkable—and unifying—parts of pre-phone touring. People really could get left behind. And getting separated from the group could be downright frightening. There was another instance when Parry was nowhere to be found, and Arcade Fire was forced to start a show in a particularly questionable area of Birmingham, Alabama without him. Kingsbury remembers thinking to himself, “Oh my God, Richard’s dead.” He wasn’t. But, in the moment, there was no way to know for sure.Facing serious problems on the road has united some of the most stable, long-lasting bands I know. The National frontman Matt Berninger tells me of a nighttime drive through the Italian Alps towards France. They took what looked like a reasonable shortcut on the map but didn’t comprehend the elevations involved, and the road just went up and up and up. Too far to turn around, but also running out of gas, they started to see abandoned trucks along the increasingly icy route. I’ve been in a couple of situations like this, where you have to call a band meeting to deal with a real problem—as opposed to discussing, like, how to record a bass guitar. It’s inherently funny because it never seems like the forum for legitimate problem solving. But you can get desperate enough in these situations to stop finger-pointing. In the end, the slippery climb was an important moment for the National, who eventually arrived at an empty customs house at the top of the Alps, with nobody for miles. They coasted down the other side.For the Walkmen, the survival moment came in 2005, when we drove directly into Hurricane Rita (“just look at this hotel deal…”) and were awakened by air raid sirens and a mandatory evacuation of Beaumont, Texas. We spent 18 hours, through a night and a day, in traffic to get 40 miles out of the evacuation zone, complete with extraordinary heat, ominous road fires, a bug orgy, and people pointing guns at one another in traffic. All the while, we pushed our opening band’s gasless rental car with a pillow tied to our bumper. This sweet move landed us on the front page of the  with a headline that wasn’t far from “Fucking Idiot Band Drives Into Hurricane.” The article closed with this wise quote from our drummer, Matt Barrick: “In the future we probably will try to avoid driving to the town that a hurricane is heading right toward in an attempt to get a leisurely sleep.”If this stuff was happening every day it would have finished us, but it didn’t. And when we were lucky, getting lost could offer little pleasures and surprises. In Sheffield, we spoke with a lot of sweet, older English couples; after the inevitable “oh dear,” they would almost always tell us to go straight, even though England is all roundabouts. We tried around 10 exits in Phoenix before finding a series of graffitied cactuses that led to the club. And one memorable day, looking for a Florence and the Machine concert we were set to open, we took a wrong turn and drove into the middle of the Indianapolis Zoo. There’s some debate in our collective memory as to whether we drove into the giraffe exhibit or the ostrich house. But if you argue too much in a band, nobody is going to want to be in a band with you. So let’s just say it was something with a long neck.",articles4,"['Walkmen', 'The Walkmen', 'Britt Daniel', 'Arcade Fire', 'Arcade Fire', 'Richard’s', 'Indianapolis Zoo']"

Check out the song’s accompanying video, directed by Flying Lotus (aka steve) and David Firth (the “Salad Fingers” creator), below.“I’d been working on stuff for the past five years, but it was always all over the place. I’d always had this thematic idea in mind—a lingering concept about fire, an eternal flame sitting on a hill,” Flying Lotus said in a statement. “Some people love it, some people hate it. Some people would go on dates there and some people would burn love letters in the fire. Then I went to this party and heard David Lynch saying the words that he wound up saying on the record. And I was like, ‘that’s it, we’re just going to go in that direction.” has a stacked list of guest contributors. In addition to Lynch, Solange, George Clinton, Tierra Whack, Anderson .Paak, Thundercat, Little Dragon, Shabazz Palaces, Toro Y Moi, Denzel Curry, and more appear on the new record. The album also features two songs in tribute to the late Mac Miller: “Find Your Own Way Home” and “Thank U Malcolm.” Flying Lotus said of the album in a statement:This album has been a refuge for pain and trying to make the most out
of that pain. Music can heal and in the wake of that tragedy it
reminded me what I’m here to do. As we get older, we start to figure
out what our purpose is and embrace it and I want to do good things
with my work. I want it to be able to help people through tough times
and inspire them to be creative.Flying Lotus has stayed busy with several other projects in recent years.

"“Come on, join us,” a voice beckons toward the end of “The Colors That You Bring,” the first single from the new project by Chicago’s improvisational scene mainstay Damon Locks. It’s a fitting welcome to what began as a solo effort but then developed into the 15-strong Black Monument Ensemble. Taken from the upcoming album , which documents their live debut at the city’s Garfield Park Conservatory, “The Colors That You Bring” draws from dusty hip-hop, astral jazz, and full-throated gospel, for an eclectic stew that’s like the Celestial Choir’s “Stand on the Word” if performed live by the Sun Ra Arkestra. But there’s a crucial activist ingredient, too. Locks has said the work was inspired by his time teaching art to maximum-security prisoners, as well as by police killings of unarmed black men. The song feels its most free, and freeing, after a spoken-word sample of singer, activist, and Civil Rights Movement heroine Lena Horne declaring, “I’m not gonna stop.” That’s when all the instruments drop out except for percussion, and we’re invited to rejoice with the ensemble as it belts out an exultant, collective statement of faith: “I still believe in us.”",articles4,"['Chicago’s', 'Black Monument Ensemble', 'Taken', 'Locks', 'Lena Horne']"

Some of those things—particularly the Universal thing—was taking forever.”He adds that he was “so high-strung over the record and all the business shit around it, the magazine [Boys Don’t Cry] was a reprieve. It stopped me from feeling like my life was on pause because of those things. It made me feel like my life was very much being fully experienced.” He also jokingly disputes ASAP Rocky’s version of his label woes in a Hot 97 interview this year, joking that he told him, “‘Rocky, I think we gotta review the CliffsNotes of that situation because you got a couple parts a little fucked up.’”Ocean goes on to elaborate on his relationship with the industry. “Fucking with major music companies, you’re going to be… deflowered,” he says. “Anytime you get into the business side of the arts, there has to be some degree of objectification or commodification that you’re comfortable with, of yourself and of your work.... A lot of people I talk to about careers in the music industry, their ideas of success have to do with nostalgia. They have to do with tropes of success, things they’ve been shown over the years that represent what a successful career is. I think that helps you become prey, because somebody can manipulate you with those things.”He also discusses the philosophy of songwriting alone—“If I’m working on lyrics, I might as well be in a vacuum-sealed container”—versus collaborating: “Sometimes the energy of having an audience, even if they don’t say shit, that adrenaline or whatever that is. Which is probably a good cocktail of performance-enhancing chemicals that make you a tiny amount more on point than when you’re totally relaxed and at ease....

"Coachella is one of the biggest music festivals in the world, run by an army of people and attracting tens of thousands of attendees. But even the most well-oiled machines act up sometimes: During the first weekend of this year’s festival, headliner Ariana Grande battled audio issues during a surprise guest appearance by Nicki Minaj, Lizzo powered through sound problems of her own, and Billie Eilish brought out Vince Staples, only for his mic to be dead. This wasn’t the first time Coachella has been beset by these problems; famously, two years ago, headliners Radiohead were forced to leave the stage twice due to technical difficulties.Representatives for Coachella promoter Goldenvoice, as well as representatives for Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj, Vince Staples, and Lizzo did not immediately respond to Pitchfork’s requests for comment. A spokesperson for Billie Eilish declined to comment, as did the founder of Rat Sound, a long-time Coachella audio vendor.Pitchfork spoke to several experts in the live audio field, who explained some of the ways sound can fail, no matter how big the stage.The problem at Radiohead’s ill-fated Coachella set was an equipment failure, says Michael Prowda, a veteran monitor engineer who has worked with Nine Inch Nails, the late David Bowie, and Radiohead (including  show). “We’re dealing with computers, and it was just a manufacturer malfunction,” Prowda says. “A defect, right? Nothing you can do about that. The thing just decided to act up and be defective during one of the biggest shows they’re going to do. They fixed it, and the show went on. So a mechanical or electronic malfunction could be one thing.”Chris Hoffman, manager of production and engineering at The New School’s College of Performing Arts, speculates that equipment might be partly to blame for last weekend’s issues as well. “What it sounds like is that systems were crashing,” he says. “My guess would be that someone is cutting back on the production side of the sound equipment in order to save more money. That would be my first assumption if things are systematically crashing for multiple artists.”But one Midwest-based audio engineer who has worked with festivals in the past dismisses the idea that Coachella would cut corners on sound. “We’re looking at potentially dozens of possible reasons. It’s not as simple as one or two. It’s just built into festivals, for better or worse,” the engineer says. “What I know of Coachella, they hire a phenomenal production team for that and a phenomenal sound team. If you’re trying to look for budget cuts, I don’t think that’s the case.”The most likely culprit, according to Prowda, was an error with how the mixing console was programmed. “If [Ariana Grande’s] up there and she can’t hear herself or can’t hear the person she’s performing with—that to me sounds like it was a programming thing,” he says. “You push a button and then all of a sudden the screen goes blank, the sound goes off.”Prowda explains: “All of the actual mixing consoles now, 99% of them are computers running on some kind of operating system. That needs to be programmed. The way we program shows, it’s like a Word document, and the next page is the next song. Say you’re Ariana Grande. That was probably not her normal touring show. She added guests. If, when you are programming, you don’t at least leave yourself room to add an extra microphone or an extra person that needs monitoring, and something comes up last minute, you’ve gotta program that stuff on the fly.”Programming these consoles under the pressure of a live Coachella audience sounds almost as difficult as performing onstage. “If it’s really last minute, we’re bringing up something and you don’t have anything programmed, it’s really difficult to do stuff in a situation like that on the fly,” Prowda says. “Do they have a person talented enough to be able to do stuff on the fly? If you don’t have any contingency plan, and they just throw something at you during the show, it’s really difficult. I feel for those people.”According to Hoffman, these explanations—programming issues or a totally last-minute guest—would also make sense. “The equipment is for every band on that stage,” Hoffman says. “So if they were showing up and they were like, ‘Oh, we lose a channel and there’s no extra channel on this console,’ or if it’s a quick, like, ‘let’s fix this in the middle of the set,’ that’s super difficult.”The Midwest audio engineer points out that in cases like this, a clear answer rarely emerges. “You will see issues happen where something happens with the sound and the artist has their own audio crew, the venue has their own audio crew, and they immediately point fingers at each other,” this person says. “Nobody’s going to take accountability for it. You’re also talking about a culture where virtually everybody involved is a contractor. Any incident that gets attached to their name could be career suicide.”",articles4,"['Ariana Grande', 'Nicki Minaj', 'Billie Eilish', 'Vince Staples', 'Radiohead', 'Ariana Grande', 'Nicki Minaj', 'Vince Staples', 'Billie Eilish', 'Radiohead’s', 'Radiohead', 'Midwest', 'Ariana Grande’s', 'Midwest']"

"On April 5, a YouTuber known as Gibi ASMR uploaded a surreal track-by-track tribute to Billie Eilish’s debut album,  It’s not your typical YouTube pop tribute.In the 38-minute clip, Gibi—who has 1.8 million subscribers and keeps her last name secret for privacy reasons—does not play an instrument or sing, at least not in any normal, hummable sense. Instead, she converts Eilish’s bedroom-pop bangers into the dominant language of the ASMR universe: close-miked whispers. Every sound and lyric is gently enunciated to maximize what is frequently referred to as “tingles”—the inexplicably pleasurable sensation some people experience as a result of aural or tactile triggers, like whispering or head massages. Throughout the mesmerizing, expertly produced performance, Gibi also stimulates the warm buzz of ASMR by rubbing her fingernails against a blanket, drawing in a sketchbook, and tapping quietly on a tiny mirror.The video has amassed more than a million views.Eilish isn’t just a goth-pop icon for disaffected teens. With her whispery vocals and woozy, bass-driven pop, the 17-year-old is becoming uniquely beloved among fans of ASMR, or autonomous sensory meridian response. Enthusiasts mainly turn to YouTube—a tingle hub with more than 13 million ASMR videos to choose from—to get their fix. Lately, a handful of those videos incorporate Eilish’s music. As one of the many comments beneath Gibi’s video puts it: “If u do ASMR and you don’t listen to Billie Eilish, do you really do ASMR?﻿”Over email, Gibi tells me that she first discovered Eilish through an ASMR cover of her song “lovely.” Then, when  came out, Gibi was contacted by someone at the singer’s UK distributor, Polydor Records, and asked if she was interested in performing a read-through of the album. She immediately said yes. “I hope [Eilish] enjoyed the video and it didn’t freak her out too much!” Gibi adds. (While Gibi says she wasn’t paid by Polydor, she was offered free merch and tickets to an upcoming Eilish show.)Gibi isn’t the only ASMR YouTuber captivated by Eilish. In November, a YouTube channel called Darkling ASMR posted a video titled “[ASMR] Softly Singing Billie Eilish Songs,” in which the star’s early songs are delivered in a breathy croon. And when Eilish’s full-length debut arrived in late March, another popular “ASMRtist” who goes by SophieMichelle ASMR released her own whisper tribute to the album—listening to it is like hearing someone stealthily record an audiobook in a crowded library.The link between Eilish and ASMR makes a strange kind of sense. Eilish, like most ASMR creators, records in her bedroom, giving her work an emotional and sonic intimacy. She is young and female, as are the vast majority of leading ASMR YouTubers. And her approach to pop production is hushed and slightly dreamlike; the songs, while catchy, do not have blaring, screamable hooks.“Billie Eilish’s vocals convey a sense of tranquility, which is further enhanced by her relaxed facial expression,” says Craig Richard, a physiologist who researches ASMR and even wrote a book, , about it. “She is not belting or pushing out vocals, her volume is low key, and her tone stays level. Her voice and disposition may be eliciting comfort and calmness, which is reminiscent of ASMR artists on YouTube.”Also reminiscent of ASMR: Eilish’s album begins with the slurpy sound of her Invisalign being removed. (Some ASMR fans enjoy mouth sounds; others detest them.) Both Eilish and ASMR seem to be particularly popular among Gen-Z—and both phenomena germinated on the internet, then spread to the larger pop consciousness.Eilish could be the first major pop star whose work reflects, or at least passively benefits from, the remarkable rise of ASMR audio techniques. Though she does not seem to have addressed the subject publicly and wasn’t available to comment for this piece, critics frequently mention ASMR when writing about her work. Here’s : “Eilish’s music is a weird mix of pop and punk, like noir ASMR that you can dance to.” And , summarizing the album’s production: “If this all sounds a bit fussy and like ASMR bait, well, it is.” And BBC Radio 1 host Jack Saunders  tweeted this observation about one of Eilish’s recent hits: “Billie Eilish - bury a friend is like asmr to me.”But does Eilish’s voice actually give Saunders ASMR? Well, no. “I didn’t experience tingles whilst listening to the song,” he clarifies over the phone. “But I certainly listened to it like I would listen to ASMR. The way she delivers it is so soft. And quite personal. Which is very similar to ASMR.” In other words, he didn’t experience ASMR, but he was  of ASMR—a small, but important, distinction.It’s possible that ASMR has now entered the popular lexicon to the point that its meaning has been diluted. Anything that is quiet or vaguely soothing gets tossed into the category. (Yes, you might feel relaxed or nostalgic while listening to Dave Matthews Band; no, Dave Matthews Band is not ASMR.)But other fans say they  gotten tingles from Eilish’s songs. Helen Holmes, an  reporter, says she’s felt it as a result of the singer’s “little giggles and intonations, and the way her intonation ‘falls off’ at the end of sentences.” On Twitter, Holmes coined a new genre category: “billie eilish is post-ASMR.” Victoria Kassab, an 18-year-old fan from Michigan, felt an involuntary shiver along her face and down her neck while listening to a remixed “8D” version of Eilish’s song “Bad Guy” that uses spatial reverb to give listeners the disorienting sense that the music is moving in circles around them. “Hearing her voice move between my ears, coupled with the way she sort of whispers when she’s singing, gave me the response,” Kassab says.Richard, who has extensively studied both the physiological effects of ASMR and the triggers that summon it, is skeptical. “Music doesn’t generally stimulate ASMR,” he explains. “The reason is that music tends to stimulate emotional arousal—in short, joy—which is usually associated with increased alertness and heart rate. But ASMR tends to stimulate relaxation and calmness, which has been shown to be associated with decreased heart rate.” This is why popular ASMR triggers tend to be… well, boring: people tapping on microphones, unwrapping plastic, reading safety instructions. You’re supposed to be lulled into a trance, not shot full of passion.That view seems to be supported by a 2017 study, in which more than 71 percent of respondents said that background music “inhibits strong tingles.” I sent Eilish’s music to the co-author of that study, Emma Barratt, a British researcher who has studied ASMR at length. Her verdict? “There are definitely some ASMR elements in here: the whispers, the finger clicking, the really strict rhythm of it,” Barratt explains. “Though our research found that background music in traditionally shot YouTube ASMR videos was generally found to be distracting, this might change when trigger sounds are organized into music, making the song the main focus rather than a distraction.”This trend might be bigger than Eilish. Plenty of other artists have found ways to dabble in ASMR. Last year, Eleanor Friedberger created an ASMR-inspired music video. Cardi B, a known tingle enthusiast, filmed a whisper video for  magazine. And comedian Brandon Wardell delivered an entire ASMR-themed comedy album, in which the jokes are all whispered.But while those excursions were handled with a wink and a nod, Eilish absorbs the tingly aesthetic into the whole of her art, without cheapening it or playing it up for laughs. Perhaps pop stars of the future will take explicit cues from ASMR culture. There’s a distinct possibility that as ASMR grows ever more mainstream, pop music might start to become quieter and more serene, reflecting the established audience desire for calming sighs and clicks instead of screams.Gibi, for one, welcomes our new whispery pop-star overlords: “The generation of ‘chill’ is upon us! Thank goodness.”",articles4,"['Billie Eilish', 'Every', 'Polydor', 'YouTubers', '“Billie Eilish', 'Craig Richard', 'ASMR', 'ASMR', 'Gen-Z', 'ASMR', 'ASMR', 'ASMR', '”But', 'ASMR', 'ASMR', 'ASMR', 'ASMR', 'Yes', 'Dave Matthews Band', 'Holmes', '”This', 'Eleanor Friedberger', '!

"Mayhem Mal was sentenced to prison over “terroristic threats” because of a 2014 songThe Supreme Court has declined to review the case of *Jamal Knox v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania*. The case revolves around Knox, a Pittsburgh rapper known professionally as Mayhem Mal, who was charged with terroristic threats and witness intimidation over lyrics in a 2012 song called “Fuck the Police.” After prosecutors alleged his lyrics targeted specific police officers in Pittsburgh, Knox was convicted and sentenced to 2-6 years in prison in 2014. Knox’s attorney argued on appeal that the song was constitutionally protected through the first amendment, but the ruling was upheld by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.The Supreme Court rejection follows the recent  brief filed by Run the Jewels’ Killer Mike and a group of other rappers—including Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, 21 Savage, Yo Gotti, Styles P, and more—in support of Knox. The brief contains a “primer on rap music and hip-hop” and claims Knox’s song is “a work of poetry” that is “told from the perspective of two invented characters in the style of rap music.”",articles4,"['Supreme Court', 'Pennsylvania*.

Finalists included James Romig—for his solo piano composition —and Andrew Norman, for his orchestral work .The late Aretha Franklin was also awarded a “Special Citation,” for “her indelible contribution to American music and culture for more than five decades.”Ellen Reid is a composer based in Los Angeles and New York. , her debut opera, focuses on the psychological trauma following sexual assault, told through a surreal story taking place between a mother and daughter in a “pristine sanctuary” where they are “locked away from the world.” Its premiere made Reid the very first composer to be commissioned by all four of Los Angeles’ major classical music institutions: the Los Angeles Philharmonic, L.A. Master Chorale, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, and L.A. Opera. The libretto was written by Roxie Perkins, and it was directed by James Darrah.In a statement, Reid said:I am blown away and incredibly honored to receive this year’s Pulitzer
Prize in music. Composing  was a challenging, rewarding and
deeply personal experience, and I hope this opera will help shed light
on the experience of surviving sexual assault. While Roxie and I did

"At this point, flailing covers of Robyn’s “Dancing on My Own” are plentiful—go to any upstanding karaoke bar on almost any night and you will most likely find  belting it out. But it’s a whole other thing to cover Robyn , as Elle Fanning does in her new movie, .As part of her audition for a singing show, Fanning’s character Violet offers a velvety rendition of Robyn’s modern dance-pop classic. With eyes closed, she slowly tilts from side to side in front of the microphone, her mind flashing back to glimpses of the life she’s is desperately trying to escape. As she moves through the ranks, the socially awkward Violet finds strength in transformative pop songs by women including Ellie Goulding, Tegan and Sara, Annie Lennox, and Sigrid.Known for her roles in award-winning, female-fronted indies like  and , Fanning has also showed off her musical side before. She delivered an a cappella take on Prince’s “Kiss” for an off-the-cuff web video, performed with the French musician Woodkid (and a full orchestra) at Switzerland’s Montreux Jazz Festival, and even duetted with A$AP Ferg on a cover of “Moon River.” Calling from this year’s SXSW Film Festival hours before ’s U.S. premiere, the 20-year-old actress spoke to us about what she’s singing along to at the moment.This song is very romantic but also kind of angry! At the start it’s so faint and soft, so when I listen on my headphones I turn it all the way up—and then the chorus comes in, and you’re like, “Oh no, the volume’s up!” It’s always a surprise. I blast it in the car, and you can really head bang to it. I love the message of the song, like, “As much as you want to put me into this box, I’m sorry, I wish I could but I can’t.” I also love at the beginning when she says, “If I could, I’d be your little spoon.” That’s such a great line.My friend Jena Malone does these Instagram stories where she puts her son to bed and then records herself dancing to different songs that she likes. In one of them, she was playing 6LACK. I had never heard of him before, so I looked up the lyrics, and it was “Pretty Little Fears.” I like to listen to this song when I’m taking off on an airplane, in that feeling of thoughtfulness. It’s great to dance to, but also moody and chill.Johnny Cash is my ultimate crush. My family loves country music, and I grew up listening to Johnny Cash and Dolly Parton in the car. This is not one of his most well-known songs but it’s a hype song for me. I listen to it, and it curdles my blood. It feels very cinematic because of the way he tells a story. I love that, from beginning to end, he never repeats a line while telling the story of someone who’s literally walking to his death and only has 25 more minutes of life. I like the live version he performed at Folsom Prison because you can also hear all of the inmates laughing and screaming. It adds such an energy to it, because they think it’s hilarious. Even though it’s depressing, the song has a lot of humor in it—at the very end, he’s being hung, but the way he sings about it is very silly. It’s a great, weirdly uplifting song about a very, very dark subject, which is something Johnny Cash does really well.",articles4,"['Elle Fanning', 'Robyn’s', 'Ellie Goulding', 'Tegan and Sara', 'Annie Lennox', 'Prince', 'I’m', 'Instagram', '6LACK', 'I’m', 'Johnny Cash', 'Dolly Parton', 'Johnny Cash']"

"Listen to the track belowInland, aka Ed Davenport, is part of a noble tradition of techno Brits in Berlin; there is something of that city’s darkly muscular sound to this release. Above all, though, “Time Leak”—the title track from his latest EP—is simple. At its heart is a nagging two-note riff, the kind of musical idea only a galaxy-brain savant would consider basing a track around. It writhes at the center of a rock-hard drum pattern and fluttering synth touches, as Davenport teases out its potential with touches of echo, filter, and delay. The track eventually builds into an eruptive climax of eye-bulging, neck-straining intensity that brings to mind the ecstatic release of rave.The track fades into darkness, like a rookie astronaut passing out on a G-force simulator, only to gather its bearings and build once more, to a climax that is slightly gentler but no less satisfying.

"As Donald Glover was headlining Coachella as Childish Gambino this weekend, he was also simultaneously launching another festival: In the new movie , which premiered on the Coachella grounds Thursday night before streaming on Amazon Prime following the Childish Gambino set Friday night, Glover plays Deni Maroon, an idealist musician trying to bring a day of festivity to his otherwise overworked island community. Produced by much of the creative team behind Glover’s hit series “Atlanta,” including director Hiro Murai and screenwriter Stephen Glover (Donald’s brother), the 55-minute-long feature isn’t really a “tropical thriller,” as it’s described in official promotional language. It’s really more of a very long commercial for Childish Gambino songs dressed up as a love story centered around a labor conflict in a tainted wonderland. While gorgeous to look at, the film gets too bogged down in romantic, albeit somewhat witless, ideas about overcoming those who’d pave paradise to put up a parking lot.Through narration (and animation), Kofi (Rihanna) opens the film by recounting a story her mother told her every night at bedtime: a long time ago, the gods created Guava, a paradise that bore rare silks produced by rare creatures called clayworms. Inevitably, though, capitalism invaded: The Red family took control of Guava’s silk industry and became the nation’s plutocrats. As the ruling class, they replaced this Shangri-La with enterprise, spreading greed among the people and tarnishing much of the island’s natural beauty. (The vibrant and colorful opening animated sequence, which, as it turns out, establishes nearly all of the plot, is a highlight of the film.)Guava has since become home to a repressed people of a West Indian-like islet culture where they speak both English and Spanish. (The movie was shot in Cuba.) Deni longs to write a song that unites them and reminds everyone of the magic Guava once had, the same magic Kofi’s mother told stories of, even if for only one day.Deni works at Red’s Cargo, the export arm of the silk operation, headed by Red Cargo (Nonso Anozie) and also hosts a popular local radio broadcast. The musician plans to throw a festival for the Guavan working class, which endures a grueling seven-day work week in accordance with the Red family’s demands for producing silk. The festival threatens to upset the lopsided work-life balance the family has established.Music follows Deni wherever he goes—it’s literally playing every time he’s on screen. He is the town’s Music Man, always carrying his guitar like an unnecessary reminder. All he does in the film is perform, and set up performances. The movie goes to great lengths trying to prove that the music Deni makes is energizing a country in stasis; in one montage, his radio broadcast is shown being dispersed like mana amongst a starving populace.Despite his inconsistent accent, Glover can be inviting as Deni, full of life and full of purpose. He represents the last bastion of Guavan magic that hasn’t been commodified by the Red family. “We live in paradise but none of us have the time or the means to actually  here,” he tells a coworker. But it’s unclear how his planned festival will remedy this injustice in the long run. Instead of a festival, why doesn’t he organize a strike?When one cargo worker explains his plan to save enough to bribe his way to America, Deni scoffs. He knows America to be no less money-grubbing than Guava, no less devoid of opportunity. “America is a concept,” he pontificates. “Anywhere where in order to get rich you have to make someone else richer is America.” Cue a rendition of “This Is America” performed as a musical number with the cargo contraptions as instruments and workers as back-up dancers. Unlike the other performances in the movie, it’s the only one that feels totally surreal. Murai, who also directed the whirlwind violence of the “This is America” video, loosely transposes its choreography to address a new context: wherever you go, even in the Land of the Free, there is no escape from the tyranny of evil men. Better to stay and fight for home. Better the enemy you know.These are the core ideals of : stand up to local tyrants for the sake of a better community and find the fuel to persevere through music. The message is a noble one, if not a bit idealist, but Glover and Murai and their team have banked too heavily on aesthetics and star power to be bogged down by empty dialogue and thin plotting.Rihanna, who was born and raised in Barbados, is in her element as a woman from a small island with big dreams, and she plays Kofi as cynical and knowing. But she doesn’t get to exist beyond being Deni’s muse. She is a supposed pragmatist who doesn’t see their home through the same rose-colored glasses, offsetting Deni’s free-spirited idealism, but because the universe of  revolves around him, she can’t help but be awed by his optimism. Her drives get lost in his, until he becomes her only motivation. As if to add insult to injury, Rihanna never performs a song, despite being the superior artist. Watching her carefully maneuver within Glover’s orbit here, staying a chronically underused talent as he erects a monument to himself, can be maddening.Many of the best episodes of “Atlanta” were written by Stephen Glover and directed by Hiro Murai, but  doesn’t share that same careful sketch work. The scenes they create together on the show are often masterful in their intimate portrayals of black humanity, balancing the humor and fucked-up-ness of persisting as struggling artists in slice of life vignettes.  misses the mark while seeking a similar destination. It almost never gives its capable cast anything to actually do. There aren’t nearly enough meaningful characters to purposefully populate an island this poorly conceived.As a vehicle for Childish Gambino songs,  makes for a pretty good music video. As a movie,  is little more than coherent. The creative team behind the film want to imagine that a paradise lost can be found again in song. At its best, it’s hard to take seriously. At its worst, it’s utterly self-indulgent.",articles4,"['Donald Glover', 'Thursday', 'Glover’s', 'Stephen Glover', 'Donald’s', 'Guava', 'Guava’s', 'Better', 'Barbados', 'Stephen Glover']"

After Portnow’s controversial comment, he apologized, saying his remarks “do not convey my beliefs and the point I was trying to make.” The Grammys then announced an independent task force, led by Time’s Up co-founder Tina Tchen, to address biases against women in the music industry.Read “Grammys Boss Neil Portnow on Race, Boycotts, and Working with Washington” on the Pitch.",articles4,"['Deborah Dugan', 'Academy’s']"

"Listen to the track belowBTS’ new album, , nabbed over 3 million pre-orders, and the music video for lead single “Boy With Luv” is on track to set world records for its already-impressive view count. Given all this success, one might assume that the group’s seven members are strangers to sadness. The album’s standout track, “HOME,” projects an image of carefree luxury. If you were to latch onto the song’s English lyrics, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is a track about flaunting wealth and reveling in one’s come-up. But despite this talk of “big cars” and “shin[ing] with flashin’ lights,” BTS find themselves unsatisfied. “The more I fill up the emptier I get/The more I’m with people the more I feel alone,” sings Jimin in the pre-chorus. Suddenly, the song’s glossy sheen feels like a facade.As spokespersons for South Korea at large, BTS are undoubtedly faced with an insurmountable amount of pressure to represent their country with grace. Last year, BTS leader RM released a solo single that hinted at his conflicted feelings about such a position. That song, however, was outwardly melancholic—a huge contrast to the glimmering confidence that “HOME” seems to exude.In a sense, “HOME” represents their current situation; while the majority of the world will find this to be a cozy R&B song, BTS harbor an unseen pain. They talk about wanting to spend time with a lover and how this person makes them feel rich—at home. By the end of the song, they’re in this lover’s presence, finding comfort at last. While BTS fans have looked to their socially conscious messages for hope and inspiration, the chart-topping K-pop group make clear that they need consolation from others too, that even though they are literally the biggest band in the world right now, they’re still human.",articles4,['I’m']

"Leonard Cohen feels like a terrible subject for a museum retrospective—his austere elegance and quiet, mordant wit would seemingly never translate to the world of recessed track lighting, vacuum-sealed stage costumes, and jostling crowds that such exhibits inevitably become. In a life marked by monastic seclusion, Cohen offered a mindfulness that seemed removed from modernity, and music that rewarded our own meditations. Even rarer, his art felt secondary to his spirituality, by his own encouragement: As he once put it, “Poetry is just the evidence of life. If your life is burning well, poetry is just the ash.” Plus, is there really much demand for branded blue raincoats in that gift shop?But before he died in 2016, the man himself gave his blessing to “Leonard Cohen: A Crack in Everything,” an exhibition that debuted in his hometown of Montreal the following year. It’s now on view at the Jewish Museum on Manhattan’s Upper East Side through September, after which it will continue an international tour. Comprising almost two-dozen new works inspired by his music and poetry, as well as a collection of covers by Feist, the National, and others, the exhibition is more a consideration of Cohen’s work than a straightforward retrospective of his career, with just enough moments of kindly irreverence to do him justice.The vast staging at the Jewish Museum hides the exhibit’s innovations, at first. Spread across three floors, it opens with a large array of screens, the type of immersive, front-and-side video entombing recently favored by Björk and particularly expensive IMAX showings. Assembled by the Montreal artist George Fok, it cribs together performance and biography clips, splicing footage of a young Cohen’s concerts with ones decades later—an unsurprising, reverential strategy, but still enjoyable. A narcotically gentle, 35-year-old Cohen sings “Bird on the Wire” at 1970’s Isle of Wight Festival, soothing the infamously riotous audience; then, swiftly, he is in his mid-70s, murmuring the same song onstage in a dark arena, still debonair in his fedora and booming delivery. Other grainy footage spans Hydra, the Greek island of his bohemian youth, along with many, many adoring women giving him doe eyes.George Fok’s video installation , pictured at the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal. Courtesy of the artist. Photo by Guy L’Heureux.This room is flanked by several smaller video installations that are less true to Cohen’s spirit, including a reel of perfunctory interview clips about his religious practices, and a maximalist rework of Cohen reciting his droll 1964 poem “The Only Tourist in Havana Turns His Thoughts Homeward” overlaid with dense new vocal harmonies. Nearby, the American artist Taryn Simon contributes an even more tonally dissonant piece: A copy of ’ front-page Cohen obituary from November 16, 2016, trumpeting the singer’s international celebrity and significance. It’s not hard to imagine him hating such blatant lionizing.Opposite that paper is the exhibition’s answer to an infinity room—an immersive installation for one viewer at a time, with a mounting queue that I instantly join with blithe, unquestioning obedience. It isn’t until a man asks me, “Are you here for the ?”—and I ask him which Cohen song that lyric is from—that I learn we are waiting for Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman’s much-hyped work, which uses video projections and illustrations to animate the experience of despair, all to “Famous Blue Raincoat.” With heightening eloquence, its cartoons build and overwhelm into a tragic climax, contrasting the cocooning comfort of Cohen’s voice. It is truly heartrending.A few other rooms of “A Crack in Everything” share ’s ingenuity. There’s an octagonal bench draped with microphones to be used for participatory humming to “Hallelujah,” and in-the-round videos of a diverse assemblage of men singing “I’m Your Man,” quavering and joyful. (One of them, a middle-aged, visibly nervous gent in a Heisenberg T-shirt, stole my heart.) Lit with jewel tones and strewn with bean bag chairs, a listening room where you can hear new Cohen covers gives off clear psychotropic vibes. Of this mostly excellent playlist, the French singer Lou Doillon’s throaty, glacial take on “Famous Blue Raincoat” is a standout, as is Julia Holter’s slightly acidic piano cover of “Take This Waltz.” Jarvis Cocker and Chilly Gonzales’ version of “Paper Thin Hotel” offers a welcome wink of louche energy, while the National collaborate with Sufjan Stevens, Richard Reed Parry, and Ragnar Kjartansson to bring an eerie doo-wop energy to “Memories.” Moby’s vaguely goth, gravelly, whistling take on “Suzanne”... also exists.Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller’s The Poetry Machine, pictured at the Musée d’art contemporain de Montréal. Courtesy of the artists, Luhring Augustine, New York, Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco, and Koyanagi Gallery, Tokyo. Photo by Guy L’Heureux.The best installation in the show is Janet Cardiff and George Bures Miller’s , a bespoke Wurlitzer organ surrounded by stacks of speakers. Each key connects to an audio clip of Cohen reciting a poem from his 2006 collection, . When pressed together, in a chord, these stanzas clash, judder discordantly, and, occasionally, harmonize. After I paw at the organ for a little while, a woman in a blue gown slides onto the bench and begins stabbing the keys with the sharp, ostentatious movements of a concert pianist, as Cohen’s voice falls over itself in surreal volubility. It feels fitting. Poetry, to Cohen, could have a melody, but it didn’t require one; it just needed to be lived.",articles4,"['Leonard Cohen', 'Björk', 'Hydra', 'Lou Doillon’s', 'Julia Holter’s', 'Sufjan Stevens', 'Richard Reed Parry', 'Ragnar Kjartansson', 'Moby’s', 'George Bures Miller’s The Poetry Machine', 'Koyanagi Gallery', 'George Bures Miller’s', 'Wurlitzer']"
"Listen to the track belowKevin Parker is on a journey toward the end of psych rock. The waypoints that made Tame Impala’s early work sound like a Beatles starter kit were transformed into the bulbous psych-pop sound of 2015’s spectacular Currents. “Borderline”—the second single the band has released this year—is somewhere way off the psychedelic map, caught between early-era Weeknd and late-era Steely Dan. It is a product of Parker’s vibrant studio nerdery and the porous music era we find ourselves in. Standing amid the song’s lead electric piano, pan flutes, and a stew of lyrics about how Los Angeles is—spoiler alert—the land of fame-sex-drugs-pain-pleasure-and-doubt, you feel a bit lost in the oxygenless soft rock and, perhaps, you do not trust the guy who led you there.It can be difficult to connect to Parker’s idea of pop music. “Borderline” is less looking at a lava lamp and more looking at an Instagram of a lava lamp. It doesn’t pull your ear to one corner with a neat synth element or hold your gaze as it becomes fascinated with a word or riff. Instead, it’s just a dense whorl of synths, auxiliary percussion, and ascending vocal lines. A highlight here is Parker’s voice, newly spry and soulful, able to convey real emotion that is nevertheless surrounded by a Jell-o-mold of sound. “Will I be known and loved/Is there one that I trust,” Parker sings on the chorus, bouncing deftly between high and low notes as if in conversation with himself. His uncertainty captures the feeling here too perfectly.",articles4,"['Parker', 'Tame Impala', 'Parker’s', 'Parker’s', 'Parker’s']"

"RPM-RIP is a Record Store Day benefit paying tribute to some great shops we’ve lostCoinciding with Record Store Day 2019, Danish headphone brand AIAIAI will launch a benefit T-shirt series called RPM-RIP. Curated by Trevor Jackson, the series features contributions from six designers to six cities that have lost iconic record stores in recent years, including London’s Groove Records, Tokyo’s Cisco, and New York City’s Kim’s Video & Music. Proceeds from RPM-RIP will go towards establishing AIAIAI’s RPM Foundation, which is a fund to help support projects by artists and musicians. T-shirts will be limited to 50 per city—see AIAIAI’s website for more information and check out some of the designs below.“I spent a large part of my youth in a basement of record stores obsessively digging through racks of vinyl learning as much about design as I did record labels, writers, musicians, producers, and engineers,” Jackson said in a statement. “None of these stores exist anymore, rents rise, cities evolve, formats change, but the cultural impact of them live on.”Read Pitchfork’s Guide to Record Store Day 2019.",articles4,"['T-', 'Trevor Jackson']"

"The “Empire” actor’s felony charges were dropped, but a new lawsuit claims he’s on the hook for over $130,000“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has been sued by the City of Chicago over the cost of the criminal investigation spurred by his allegedly false police report,  reports. City officials confirmed plans to file the lawsuit last week. The lawsuit, viewed by Pitchfork, argues that because Smollett staged an attack and filed a false police report, he must reimburse the cost of the police investigation—calculated at $130,106—plus more in penalty fees. Pitchfork has reached out to Smollett’s legal representation.In February, Smollett was charged with 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report about an incident initially treated a hate crime. Last month, the charges were dropped, the judge sealed the case, and Smollet’s record was expunged. Outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel reacted to the news by calling it a “whitewash of justice.”On January 29, it was reported that Smollett was attacked in Chicago by two men that he claimed called him homophobic and racist slurs. He also claimed they put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him, and yelled “this is MAGA country.” Brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were arrested and questioned by police in connection with the alleged attack; two days later, the Osundairos were released without criminal charges and Smollet became a suspect in the case.Smollett pled not guilty after turning himself in on February 21. Following his arrest, “Empire” producers announced that Smollett would be cut from the rest of the show’s current season.",articles4,"['Jussie Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollet’s', 'Smollet', 'Smollett']"

"“It’s up to all of us now to make sure that these recommendations are implemented”In 2012, Radiohead’s drum tech, 33-year-old Scott Johnson, was killed when the stage collapsed before the band’s scheduled performance in Toronto’s Downsview Park. Earlier this year, Ontario’s chief coroner began a new inquest into Johnson’s death, after a judge stayed the case in 2017. The five-person jury returned yesterday, April 10, with a set of non-binding recommendations. Radiohead have now shared a statement upon the conclusion of the inquest. Read it below.The Inquest into the death of our friend and crew member, Scott
Johnson, has now concluded. The Inquest itself was conducted in a
constructive, thorough and fair-minded way. It revealed the negligence
and failings that led to Scott’s death.A verdict of Accidental Death
was returned, which feels frustratingly insufficient given that the
stage collapse was shown to be preventable. The Jury have made sound
and practical recommendations to prevent such an accident happening
again and to ensure the future safety of show crews and audiences.
It’s up to all of us now to make sure that these recommendations are
implemented.We’d like to express our gratitude to the Coroner’s
Office and the Jury for their tireless work in the Inquest. Our love
and respect go out to Ken and Sue Johnson, Scott’s parents. He will be
forever in our thoughts.https://twitter.com/radiohead/status/1116385227851673600",articles4,"['Radiohead’s', 'Earlier', 'Johnson’s', 'Radiohead', 'Inquest', 'Inquest', 'The Jury', 'Inquest']"

"Listen to the track belowSince the early 1990s, the Japanese-born Kazu Makino has been the voice of Blonde Redhead, perfecting a weightless, ethereal style that’s often imitated and rarely equaled. This year, Makino will release her first solo album, , which finds her moving away from rock instrumentation in favor of synthesizers, samplers, and looping techniques. First single “Salty” hovers between a pop song and a fluid electronic composition, underlining gentle pulsations with sine-wave synths and a quietly insistent drumbeat.Having relocated to escape stress and pollution in New York City, Makino wrote her new songs at home on the Italian island of Elba, inspired by the calm of a seaside environment. “Salty” speaks particularly to her passion for equestrianism; the lyrics officially include two horse emojis. “Eyes talk, my mind/Led by whatever you do...move,” she sings, an impressionistic capture of the nonverbal bond between horse and rider. Like a long summer sunset, “Salty” spends a third of its time winding down, but as the synthesizer devolves into pointillist blips and Makino begins to mix fragments of English with Japanese, her style remains unmistakable.",articles4,['Blonde Redhead']
"Kendrick opens up about early days touring with Nipsey: “I watched a young, ambitious black male orchestrate fellowship amongst the men around him on that tour”Today, a memorial service for the late rapper Nipsey Hussle is being held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. “Nipsey Hussle’s Celebration of Life” featured performances by Jhené Aiko and others, as well as the reading of a letter written by former president Barack Obama. In the event program handed out to attendees, many of Nipsey’s friends paid tribute, including artists like JAY-Z, YG, and the Game, as well as athletes such as Russell Westbrook and James Harden.Among the written tributes is an essay from Kendrick Lamar, who featured on Nipsey’s Victory Lap song “Dedication.” He wrote about his early days meeting and touring with Nipsey. Read the tribute in its entirety below.In 2009, I remember trekking cities alongside Nipsey and family. Both
performing as opening acts on The Game LAX tour. Our sprinter van
trailed their mobile home from state to state.Though I was there as support for my brother Jay Rock, Nipsey greeted
me as one of his own. And that was very commendable. Casually, I would
go out to the crowd and listen to the substance he spewed on stage.
Thinking to myself, this is the type of talent I want to be a part of.
His charisma and way with words was powerful. But his integrity as a
person made me even more enthused.I watched a young, ambitious black male orchestrate fellowship amongst
the men around him on that tour. Determined to execute one thing—and
that was Greatness. Greatness in knowledge, greatness in wealth, and
greatness in self. My curiosity about who he really was started to
grow from that moment in time. Was he a product of Crenshaw and
Slauson? Was he a radical? Or was he a thinker? That mystique kept me
engaged throughout his life and career. The years progressed, and my
admiration grew from up close and from afar. Watching his interviews,
his philosophies, and his work amongst the black community.Time surely revealed itself. I realized Nipsey was all of those
perspectives. But most importantly, he was a vessel from God. As my
heart aches for him and his family, I understand that the Most High
doesn’t make mistakes. I pray that Ermias Foundation continues to
blossom. I pray for those who trespass against it.A true King will be tested in adversity. To stand in fearlessness in
what he believes will impact on the earth, as well as in heaven. So
thank you Nipsey the Radical. Nipsey the Thinker. Nipsey the Father.

Great. And from now on, Nipsey the Messenger…...Shalom.Read “Nipsey Hussle’s Legacy Is Bigger Than Rap” on Levels.",articles4,"['Nipsey Hussle', 'Barack Obama', 'Nipsey’s', 'JAY-Z', 'James Harden', 'Crenshaw', 'Shalom']"

daughters, and after his passing, I had the chance to learn more about
his transformation and his community work.While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up
and see only gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw potential. He saw
hope. He saw a community that, even through its flaws, taught him to
always keep going. His choice to invest in that community rather than
ignore it—to build a skills training center and a coworking space in
Crenshaw; to lift up the Eritrean American community; to set an
example for young people to follow—is a legacy worthy of celebration.
I hope his memory inspires more good work in Crenshaw and communities
like it.Michelle and I send our sympathies to Lauren, Emani, Kross, and the

"After weeks of testimony about the 2012 stage collapse that killed Scott Johnson, a Toronto jury returns with its recommendationsBefore Radiohead’s scheduled 2012 set at Downsview Park in Toronto, the stage collapsed, killing the band's drum technician, 33-year-old Scott Johnson. The Ontario Ministry of Labour brought charges against promoter Live Nation, scaffolding company Optex Staging and Services, and engineer Domenic Cugliari in 2013. After multiple delays, a judge stayed the charges in September 2017, ruling that the case took too long.Ontario’s chief coroner began a new inquest on March 25 to investigate what caused Scott Johnson’s death. The five-person inquest jury heard more than two weeks of testimony, including statements from Radiohead drummer Philip Selway and Ken Johnson, the drum technician’s father.As BBC News reports, the jury returned today (April 10) with a set of 28 non-binding recommendations. One proposal was the creation of a working group to determine and update best practices for the live performance industry. Ken Johnson, who advises on scaffolding safety in the UK,  was invited to participate in the group. A number of the jury’s other recommendations focused on improving oversight of safety rules for building temporary stages in Ontario.As the Canadian Press reports, Ken Johnson told reporters outside the coroner’s court today that he “would be disappointed” if nothing changed as a result of the investigation. “For us, we sort of accept that life is different and we expect that emotional rollercoaster, we don’t see a way out for that,” he said. “I think it just brings some closure, at least. There’s hardly a month gone by in the last seven years where I’m not involved in some dialogue about Scott and what’s happened, so I quite look forward to perhaps not having that dialogue.”Live Nation has denied any wrongdoing, stating in 2013, “We absolutely maintain that Live Nation and our employees did everything possible to ensure the safety of anyone who was on or near the stage involved in the tragic incident that led to the unfortunate death of Mr. Scott Johnson.”Radiohead have expressed dismay and outrage multiple times. In 2018, at their first performance in Toronto since the incident, Thom Yorke said to the crowd, “The people who should be held accountable are still not being held accountable in your city. The silence is fucking deafening.” Philip Selway sat down for an interview about Johnson with the BBC last summer. “It’s very frustrating. The court case broke down on a technicality,” Selway said, referring to how the court case against Live Nation and other parties allegedly responsible for the incident came to a standstill last fall. “So there have been no real answers. Without the answers we can’t ensure that an accident like this can’t happen again.”Radiohead dedicated their latest album, 2016's , to Johnson’s memory.",articles4,"['Radiohead’s', 'Domenic Cugliari', 'Scott Johnson’s', 'Ken Johnson', 'I’m', 'Thom Yorke', 'Selway', '”Radiohead', 'Johnson’s']"

"Republican leader Mitch McConnell says bill will not pass in the SenateToday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Save the Internet Act, a bill to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted to repeal in 2017, as The New York Times reports. The 232-190 vote fell across party lines. The bill faces a difficult road ahead, as Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has avowed to block its passage (calling it “dead on arrival”) and the Office of Management and Budget has advised President Trump to veto it should it get to his desk.In May 2018, the Senate voted to halt the FCC’s vote to repeal the Obama-era net neutrality protections. Those protections were previously approved by the FCC in 2015 to prevent internet service providers from potentially speeding up, slowing down, or banning specific websites and apps, and charging users for faster access to certain content. The Save the Internet Act would be a regulatory action against internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon and Comcast, stopping them from throttling speeds for certain websites.Many musicians have called for Congress to stop the FFC’s plan to kill net neutrality protections. In December 2017, Tom Morello, Michael Stipe, Talib Kweli, and many others signed a letter in support of net neutrality.Read “Musicians Have Fought Too Damn Hard to Let Trump Kill Net Neutrality Now” on the Pitch.",articles4,"['SenateToday', 'Talib Kweli']"

"Listen to the track belowLike a legion of indie-pop acts before them, Brooklyn foursome Charly Bliss reject the notion that dark subject matter must be mirrored by a somber tone. On their latest single “Hard to Believe,” the band transform the struggle to break away from a toxic relationship into bouncy power-pop. While the first two songs off their upcoming sophomore record, , explored bubbly synths, here Charly Bliss return to the sugar rush of their 2017 debut .Against a relentless guitar riff, singer and guitarist Eva Hendricks confronts a romantic conflict that remains perversely enticing despite undeniable pain. “I’m kissing everything that moves/I’m kissing anything that takes me far away from you,” she professes, before revealing how tangled up she truly is: “But I would rather eat than starve/I would rather kiss you hard.” As Hendricks searches for an escape, the band chugs on, backing off just long enough to allow her to confront reality: “Tomorrow is coming/I know you don’t love me.” By the song’s conclusion, she hasn’t quite severed the loop of self-doubt, an incongruously upbeat reminder that it’s hard to believe in anyone, even yourself.",articles4,"['Charly Bliss', 'Charly Bliss']"

"This summer, there are more music festivals to choose between than ever, in ever-more exotic locations, and with more famous names on the main stages. But it takes more than A-list talent and a nice sunset to make a festival worth your time and travel. Here, we break down the best offerings of the year from around the globe, in chronological order. We believe these have the best talent, the most interesting settings, and the purest love of music in all its weird and wonderful forms. Grab your passport and jump in.New Orleans
April 25-May 5
Featuring: Katy Perry, J Balvin, Herbie HancockIt’s an understatement to say the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival offers a diverse lineup: Do you long for the days of early 2010s pop music? Katy Perry is here. Are you hip to reggaeton? You will be once J Balvin lays down a set. Are you pulling up to spend time with your fellow jazz-heads? Herbie Hancock is at the keys. This 50th anniversary sprawl, held over two long weekends, is a time for discovery and to experience artists that you’ve spent a lifetime with; just come prepared to be overwhelmed. –Alphonse PierreBuy tickets to New Orleans Jazz and Heritage here.Virginia Beach, Virginia

Featuring: Pharrell, Rosalía, Travis Scott, MigosSomething in the Water, held in Pharrell’s hometown of Virginia Beach, should make good use of the producer/singer’s talent as an industry tastemaker and curator, with sets by Travis Scott, Pusha-T, and Rosalía. The man of the hour will also stage a career retrospective of sorts in a “Pharrell and Friends” set that includes appearances by Missy Elliott, Snoop Dogg, Gwen Stefani, Usher, and more. It’s a standout new offering in the overstuffed festival season. –Alphonse PierreBuy tickets to Something in the Water here.St. Paul’s Bay, Malta

For three days in sunny Malta, she curates an electronic music haven with sets by Black Coffee, DJ Seinfeld, and Peggy Gou, as well as a sprinkling of grime artists like Lady Leshurr, Octavian, and AJ Tracey. The real calling card for this event might be the separately ticketed beach party, though, which boasts a diverse, instantly legendary program of Honey Dijon, Jazzy Jeff, Koffee, and Ms. Mac herself. –Michelle KimBrooklyn

Vernon and Dessner will be joined by artists including Boys Noize, Sinkane, and Greg Fox to perform new music at the Pioneer Works art space in Brooklyn. This is a festival in the loosest possible sense of the term, with a focus on the artists working together in residency to deliver performances that may never occur again. –Noah YooPhoto by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesArcosanti, Arizona

Featuring: DJ Koze, Peggy Gou, Anderson .Paak & the Free NationalsNow entering its sixth year, FORM Arcosanti remains one of North America’s most consistently innovative festivals. Located within Arcosanti, a surreal utopian town designed by the Italian-American architect Paolo Soleri, FORM focuses on providing emotional experiences over spectacle. As there are no VIP tickets or overlapping sets, the festival attracts an open-minded, artistic crowd—as well as huge artists looking to experiment with more intimate sets. –Quinn MorelandBuy tickets to FORM Arcosanti here.Miami

Featuring: Lil Wayne, Young M.A, DMX, Lil Uzi VertIt only took five years for Rolling Loud to become rap’s premier music festival, a Rock the Bells for the SoundCloud generation. This year, it offers its most well-rounded lineup yet, full of veterans like DMX, Rick Ross, and Gucci Mane; once and future stars like Playboi Carti and Young Thug; and exciting prospects like Lil Tjay and Polo G. After frequently coming under fire for its lack of gender diversity, its number of women finally hits double digits with Cardi B, Young M.A, Megan Thee Stallion, Saweetie, and more. Plus, there will be over a dozen “Lil”s in attendance—Wayne, Uzi Vert, Baby, and Durk among them. This is such a wide-ranging assortment of rappers, you’ll be sure to catch a few you love, some you never expected to like, and a handful you’ve never even heard of. –Sheldon PearceBuy tickets to Rolling Loud here.Chambord, France

Not only is the setting awe-inspiring, the lineup is gigantic, boasting 226 performers spanning beloved indie rockers to reggaeton heroes to dance floor divas. This year, Primavera launched their “New Normal” campaign, which commits to a gender-equal lineup; over 50% of this year’s performers are female. Also, Pitchfork returns with its own stage close to the paella stand! –Quinn MorelandBuy tickets to Primavera Sound here.Jeezy performs at Roots Picnic 2017.

Featuring: The Roots, H.E.R., 21 SavageThe Roots Picnic is conscious that festivals are evolving: A live session of “The Joe Budden Podcast” is billed over Raphael Saadiq vs. Soulquarians, City Girls, and Blueface. Other podcasts like Crissle and Kid Fury’s “The Read” are receiving similar treatment, an interesting move for these programs that often don’t get the respect they deserve. But this Picnic is still about the music, first and foremost: It’s headlined, of course, by the Roots, who will be performing their acclaimed album  for its 20th anniversary.

Featuring: Sharon Van EttenAt last year’s Dark Mofo, held on the rugged Australian island of Tasmania, the artist Mike Parr spent 72 hours “entombed” in a steel box buried beneath a busy street—par for the course for a multimedia festival, timed to the Southern Hemisphere’s winter solstice, that takes doom to new heights (and depths). This year’s event may not feature the red neon inverted crosses that incensed some Christians last year, but the air of provocation should persist. The artist Simon Denny’s Mine installation explores the intersection of mineral extraction, data collection, and augmented reality; the Dark and Dangerous Thoughts symposium will explore fear, sex, race, and colonial histories. Sharon Van Etten is the only musician announced so far, but a glance at last year’s lineup—Alice Glass and Zola Jesus, Electric Wizard, Einstürzende Neubauten, Tanya Tagaq—suggests plenty of thrills are in store. –Philip SherburneSougia, Crete
June 7-8
Featuring: DJ Paypal, Nkisi, Juliana HuxtableSougia, a tiny, beachside village nestled against rocky mountains on the southern coast of Crete, isn’t typically associated with the international festival circuit. But that makes it the perfect antidote to the tourist throngs in Ibiza and Croatia. The inaugural edition of Nature Loves Courage promises two nights of cutting-edge dance music—the soulful footwork of DJ Paypal, the polyrhythmic doom techno of Nkisi, the wide-ranging sets of the multimedia artist Juliana Huxtable—with a strong focus on the kinds of diversity and radical inclusivity to which most festivals merely pay lip service. The event’s name comes from a quote by the psychedelic pioneer Terence McKenna, who declared that magic is created “by hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering it’s a feather bed.” For two potentially magical days, 350 revelers will get the chance to do just that. –Philip SherburnePlage de Vaires-Torcy, Paris
June 8-9
Featuring: Nina Kraviz, Marcel Dettmann, Âme, Loco DiceMarvellous Island is an annual electronic music gathering held on a beautiful, sandy island on the outskirts of Paris. The lineup is catnip for the Resident Advisor set: Berghain stalwart Marcel Dettmann headlines the first night, while Russian techno maven Nina Kraviz commands the second. Ravers can take dance breaks on the beach or even cruise around in  a paddle boat. –Noah YooSomerset, England

Featuring: Stormzy, Janet Jackson, Vampire Weekend, LowAfter taking a year off to lets its fields recover, Glastonbury returns with a wondrous, distinctive lineup that continues its departure from rockist tradition. This is quite likely the most eclectic show ever put on at Worthy Farm. Grime star Stormzy, only the third hip-hop headliner ever, joins the Cure and the Killers atop the bill and leads the festival’s most manifold rap selection to date (Wu-Tang Clan, Little Simz, Lizzo, Stefflon Don, Slowthai). Several generations of black women anchor the long weekend—Janet Jackson, Ms. Lauryn Hill, Mavis Staples, Janelle Monáe, and Fatoumata Diawara among them—with ample space left for a few big stage staples like Tame Impala and Vampire Weekend. From cosmic jazz (Kamasi Washington) to flamenco pop (Rosalía) to dreamy drone (Low), there is something for everyone in the rejuvenated countryside. –Sheldon PearceKutnà Hora, Czech Republic
July 12-14
TBDIf you hadn’t guessed from its name or the website—yep, that’s an evil Gremlin flashing a toothsome grin on the front page of last year’s lineup—Creepy Teepee has a twisted sense of humor. Rooted in punk and the iciest edges of electronic fringe music, it’s a refreshingly countercultural proposition, a global gathering of the self-identified “WORLD WIDE WEIRD,” given to proclamations like “No Nation! Free Fashion! Be Your Own Corporation!” and “Make the Fortress Europe Fall!” Artists storming the ramparts this year have yet to be announced, but if recent years’ rosters are anything to go by (Iceage, Klein, Calvin Johnson, Yves Tumor, Nídia), it’ll be every bit the mindfuck that their graphic design is. –Philip SherburneFestivalgoers at Pitchfork Music Festival 2018.

Featuring: Robyn, HAIM, The Isley Brothers, Earl SweatshirtPitchfork Festival is small enough to allow you some personal space but populated enough for you to blend in while inevitably rapping along to Earl Sweatshirt and dancing—on your own, how else?—to Robyn. When it’s time for a break from the music, head over to the record tent and bleed money blissfully. Other places for escape: pizza stands, bao stands, avant-garde electronic acts at the Blue Stage.

The weekend celebrates all things Afropop, dancehall, hip-hop, and R&B. Aside from those Nigerian stars, there will also be eclectic offerings from their diasporic brothers and sisters based in the UK (Stefflon Don, Ms. Dynamite, Octavian) and Jamaica (Busy Signal, Kranium).

This year might be its best yet: Cardi B, Tame Impala, and the Cure top the bill, joined by Robyn, Neneh Cherry, Earl Sweatshirt, Blood Orange, Mitski, and more. This year, the Finnish National Opera presents their own slate of art programming and performances, and choreographer Wayne McGregor presents his piece , with its original score performed live by its composer: Jlin. –Noah YooLexington, Kentucky

The two-day event takes place at the historic Keeneland horse racing grounds and, in true Lexington fashion, it offers horse betting and drink tasting. With your highball glass and big floppy hat, it’s a perfect moment to bask in the glory of queens like Mavis Staples, Lucinda Williams, and Brandi Carlile.

The lineup is rounded out with artists like Jlin, the dancehall experimentalist Gaika, and the heady techno Call Super.

"Listen to the track belowSince Lil Uzi Vert’s 2017 debut, , he’s been staging what can only be described as a bizarre Generation Now walkout, briefly retiring, then signing a management deal with Roc Nation, then leaking his pitched-up comeback single “Free Uzi.” After momentarily returning to the rapid-fire rapping that earned him his name, he goes Peak Uzi on “Sanguine Paradise,” one of two songs released in advance of his long-awaited album, . Where “Free Uzi” was punchy, “Sanguine Paradise” is glossy. His melodies mimic the piano plinks as his cadences trace their ridges. Before long, he’s lost in the blinding light of frosted diamonds, not only making the best of a bad situation but finding his own little personal utopia.Uzi’s raps of late have seemed like a never-ending string of self-indulgent bons mots, like a trickster god trying continuously to amuse himself. He calls g-strings “skinny thongs” and likens one to a tightrope. He’s making $100k in the duration of a Vine and he has two horns like a rhino. It’s solipsism in an endless spiral; he can’t lose the thread because there isn’t one to begin with. The epic spree-raps come in waves and even the flexes presented as digression are absurdly colorful (“In reality I’m 5'4""/Stand on my money now I’m 6'6""; “Side note: You will never reach my goals”). Working On Dying producers Oogie Mane and Brandon Finessin whip up boisterous horns and 808s in an attempt to match his energy.

The letter expresses outrage at the streaming company’s plans to appeal a January 2018 decision by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board, which determined that mechanical royalties will be increased from 10.5 percent to 15.1 percent over the next five years. The letter’s signees includes songwriters and producers who have been previously nominated for Spotify’s Secret Genius awards, an annual awards show the streaming company launched in 2017 to honor behind-the-scenes figures in the music industry.“We’re hurt and disappointed. You created a songwriter relations team and ingratiated Spotify into our community,” the letter reads. “We know that you are not the only DSP appealing the Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) rate determination. You are, however, the only provider that made us feel we were working to build a modern music industry together. Now, we can see the real reason for your songwriter outreach.

"With over 500 releases available, we’ve picked out 20 you should buy on Saturday, April 13This Saturday, April 13, is Record Store Day—the time for vinyl junkies to hit the shops and splurge on rare reissues, long-out-of-print fan favorites, colorful records, special-edition singles, and more. Wading through the list of 500 releases, however, is daunting. We’ve hand-picked 20 that are worth seeking out, including releases from Prince, Robyn, Bob Dylan, Erykah Badu, Death Grips, Moses Sumney, Jeff Tweedy, and more. (Note: We only included releases that will be exclusively available in participating indie stores on Saturday, and nowhere else. We did not include “Record Store Day First Releases,” which will be distributed more widely following Record Store Day.)The second season of “Twin Peaks” is a polarizing piece of work. David Lynch himself has, in fact, referred to it as “very stupid and goofy.” While Season 2 did relieve some tension once Laura Palmer’s killer is finally revealed, the music retained its ominous mystique. Now on colored vinyl with new artwork, you can revisit the strange journey, from “Laura’s Dark Boogie” to “Audrey’s Prayer.” —Sam SodomskyWith a discography as vast and magnificent as Aretha Franklin’s, it’s difficult to know where to start if you’re looking to add her work to your vinyl collection.  is a good option. Iconic singles like “Respect,” “A Natural Woman (You Make Me Feel Like),” and “Chain of Fools” have been pressed across five 7"" records and collected in a limited box set. —Noah YooDeath Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard pays tribute to the late Richard Swift with a 7"" whose proceeds will go to the Swift family, MusiCares, and Music Support UK in order “to raise awareness for addiction and bring community to those suffering.” The split single includes Monkees and Teenage Fanclub covers, recorded in separate sessions with Swift. “All of us who knew and loved Richard Swift are still reeling from the loss,” Gibbard said. “And while I wish it were under other circumstances, I am beyond proud to share some of the work we did together.” —Matthew StraussIt’s ironic to refer to any version of Bob Dylan’s 1975 classic  as a “lost album,” but this particular edition—in its intimate, original form before Dylan was convinced to revamp half the tracks with a backing band—marks a long-treasured bootleg for Dylan fans. This is its first official release. —Sam SodomskyOriginally released in 1973 under the title , this 1966 live album from jazz giant Cecil Taylor features Jimmy Lyons, Alan Silva, and Andrew Cyrille. Recorded in the same year as the free jazz pioneer’s seminal  studio album,  sees Taylor place his virtuosity on full display. This reissue comes on “audiophile-grade” LPs with remastered recordings, as well as photos and liner notes. —Noah YooCourtney Barnett's brand new song “Everybody Here Hates You” gets a 12"" release with a hand-drawn cover artwork by Barnett herself. The B-side is “Small Talk,” a track released in 2018 that was recorded during the sessions for her last full-length . —Noah YooA quarter-century after its release,  is mostly remembered for two things—the tragic accidental death of actor Brandon Lee during filming, and its iconic soundtrack. The collection, which now comes to vinyl for the first time, offers a snapshot of some of the decade’s most important bands. It opens with the Cure’s “Burn” and includes an ascendant Nine Inch Nails cover of Joy Division’s “Dead Souls,” Rollins Band covering Suicide, plus the Jesus and Mary Chain, Rage Against the Machine, and more. —Noah YooDeath Grips are cleaning up their internet detritus with the physical release of , a 22-minute piece they uploaded two years ago. The B-side includes two more loosies: “More Than Fairy” (a May 2016 collaboration with Primus’ Les Claypool) and the elegantly titled “electronic drum solo dub mix (single take)” (an 11-minute track from October 2017). —Matthew StraussYou’re going to be  to buy this new 7"" featuring Erykah Badu’s cover of Squeeze’s unavoidable 1981 single. It’s the first chance to hear it, having never been released digitally or performed live. Badu made the song with James Poyser, producer/engineer Steve Mandel, Thundercat, and more. —Matthew StraussComedian and podcast icon Marc Maron is a noted music fan and musician himself, having hosted hundreds of artists on his long-running “WTF With Marc Maron” podcast over the past decade. Now, selected performances from the podcast are being pressed to vinyl for the first time, including stripped-down renditions from Jason Isbell, J Mascis, Aimee Mann, Margo Price, and many more. —Noah YooWhat’s better than 10 new Jeff Tweedy songs? 10  new Jeff Tweedy songs. , the companion to last year’s stark, autobiographical solo album , features an additional set of unreleased songs from Wilco’s ever-prolific frontman. —Sam SodomskyAfter putting some puzzles in the mail, Modest Mouse recently returned with their first new track in four years, “Poison the Well.” The RSD 7"" comes with a previously unreleased B-side called “I’m Still Here,” and it’s pressed on triangular mint green vinyl. —Noah YooFans are patiently awaiting Moses Sumney’s follow-up to his incredible debut . But until LP2 arrives, there’s , a three-song 2018 release that’s coming to vinyl for the first time. The EP features fan favorite “Rank & File.” —Noah YooGerard Way might be too busy with “The Umbrella Academy” to reform My Chemical Romance, but you can now relive the emo outfit’s glory days on vinyl. Along with the band’s final performance of “The Black Parade,” the double LP includes three bonus tracks and “a Death Certificate.” The Black Parade is dead; long live the Black Parade. —Noah YooThe only way you’d have a copy of this 1995 promotional tape—among the first releases credited to the Artist Formerly Known as Prince—was if you attended Paris’ Fashion Week that summer. That changes this Record Store Day, as the odds-and-ends companion to his  album gets its first-ever reissue. —Sam SodomskySince its release in 2010, Robyn’s  has traveled everywhere: TV soundtracks, karaoke clubs, subway dance parties. But for many fans, the one place where it remained tragically absent was our turntables. This Record Store Day, dance (on your own) over to your local shop. —Sam SodomskyTaking the stage at 3:30 in the morning, Sly & The Family Stone delivered a Woodstock performance for the ages. Sly and the band were in top form, fresh off the release of their fourth album , and they weren’t afraid to bring the hits. Now, 50 years after it was recorded, this crucial you-had-to-be-there moment officially comes to vinyl. —Noah YooThree-inch records are a thing again. White Stripes fans from the mid-2000s might remember Jack White’s “Triple Inchophones,” mini record players imported from Japan that played these novelty releases. Now, Third Man’s bringing them back: The label is putting out a collection of titles from the Raconteurs, the White Stripes, and the Dead Weather as tiny little records. —Noah YooThroughout the 1970s, Todd Rundgren was signed to Bearsville Records, the label founded by folk music figure Albert Grossman. He released numerous full-lengths in the decade before signing to Warner Bros. at the top of the 1980s. Now, all of Rundgren’s singles from that time have been compiled in one release for the first time, spanning two decades of his illustrious career. —Noah YooAfter witnessing the Sex Pistols perform on her 19th birthday, Poly Styrene was inspired to form a band. She put an ad in a magazine looking for “young punk who want to stick it together,” and thus X-Ray Spex was born. The new double LP  captures the British band’s ferocious early days through a collection that features an array of beloved singles like “Oh Bondage! Up Yours!” alongside a bonus record featuring a 1977 show at London’s Roxy Club. —Quinn Moreland",articles4,"['Prince', 'Erykah Badu', 'Death Grips', 'Jeff Tweedy', 'David Lynch', 'Aretha Franklin’s', 'Iconic', 'Ben Gibbard', 'Richard Swift', 'Monkees', 'Teenage Fanclub', 'Swift', 'Richard Swift', 'Gibbard', 'Bob Dylan’s', 'Cecil Taylor', 'Jimmy Lyons', 'Alan Silva', 'Andrew Cyrille', 'Brandon Lee', 'Nine Inch Nails', 'Rollins Band', 'Rage Against the Machine', 'Matthew StraussYou’re', 'Erykah Badu’s', 'Steve Mandel', 'Thundercat', 'Marc Maron', 'Margo Price', 'Jeff Tweedy', 'Jeff Tweedy', 'Moses Sumney’s', 'LP2', 'The Black Parade', 'Black Parade', 'Artist Formerly', 'Prince', 'Robyn’s', 'Sly & The Family Stone', 'White Stripes', 'Jack White’s', 'Third Man', 'Dead Weather', 'Todd Rundgren', 'Rundgren’s', 'Sex Pistols', 'Roxy Club']"

"Overall plastic production has decreased in the streaming era while greenhouse gas emissions have reportedly increasedThough the overall plastic production in the recording industry has dropped, greenhouse gas emissions caused by music consumption have reached an unprecedented high, a new study from the University of Glasgow shows. The changes in environmental impact are due to the decreasing popularity of physical music formats and rise in digital music streaming.The amount of plastic production used to package vinyl, cassettes, and CDs have dropped drastically in the U.S. In 1977 (the year in which U.S. sales of the vinyl record peaked), the recording industry used 58 million kilograms of plastic. In 1988 (the peak of cassette sales), that figure dropped slightly to 56 million kilograms of plastic. In 2000 (the peak of CD sales), the industry used 61 million kilograms of plastic. When streaming became the primary method of music listening, the amount of plastics dropped drastically down to around 8 million kilograms by 2016.“The figures may even suggest that the rises of downloading and streaming are making music more environmentally friendly,” says Dr. Kyle Devine, the University of Oslo professor who led research on the environmental costs of music consumption. “But a very different picture emerges when we think about the energy used to power online music listening. Storing and processing music online uses a tremendous amount of resources and energy—which has a high impact on the environment.”After translating the production of plastics and the generation of electricity (for storing and transmitting digital audio files) into greenhouse gas equivalents (GHGs), researchers found that the rise in streaming has led to an increasingly negative impact on the environment. While 140 million kilograms of GHGs were generated in 1977, 136 million kilograms in 1988, and 157 million in 2000. By 2016, the generation of GHGs by storing and transmitting digital music files was estimated to be between 200-350 million kilograms in the U.S. alone.The research also shows that while the environmental cost of music consumption has never been higher, the price consumers are willing to pay for music has never been lower. In 1997, consumers were willing to pay roughly 4.83% of an average weekly salary. That percentage decreased to roughly 1.22% of an average weekly salary in 2013. Since the advent of streaming, the research shows that consumers now pay only just over 1% of their weekly salary to listen to a vast library of music.",articles4,[]

"Listen to the track belowScHoolboy Q is never less interesting than when he’s trying to fuck something. Take the yammering “Studio” and its radio-baiting “Overtime” as examples; in this mode, his personality turns off and his one-track mind derails into a wreck of cringey come-ons and flat-out corny bars. Or take “CHopstix,” as Q uses the kitchen utensils in question as abstract imagery for sex, an idea lifted straight from the middle of his verse—“I like her legs up like chopsticks”—and reiterated aimlessly throughout the song.

"Thom Yorke has undergone a subtle transformation in the past decade. Instead of working hard to contort his ego enough to fill arenas, the 50-year-old Radiohead frontman often lets the occasion rise to him. He teases and showboats, riding out mistakes with ponytailed charm. A brave observer might suggest these changes bear the hallmarks of contentment. But, on the occasion of Yorke’s plunge into contemporary classical last night, his laidback rebirth meant little. Despite a delirious reception to his compositions, Yorke appeared stricken before the Philharmonie de Paris crowd. More than his bandmate and sometime guru Jonny Greenwood, now a celebrated composer in his own right, he resembled a Thom Yorke of another era: the vacant ghost who drifted through Radiohead’s 1998 tour doc Meeting People Is Easy.Yorke debuted two new compositions: the 20-minute “Don’t Fear the Light” and the more songlike “Gawpers.” Performing with him was the Minimalist Dream House band, named to honor the midcentury pioneer La Monte Young. The group comprises the National’s Bryce Dessner, composer-guitarist David Chalmin, and, center stage at enormous Steinways, the electrifying pianists Katia and Marielle Labèque. With her glitter patches and sparkly-striped trousers, Katia looked like a haunted Victorian cowboy.To start, the Minimalist Dream House band played a suite of old and new compositions. Bryce Dessner’s “Haven,” which premiered at the concert, screamed Bryce Dessner: jumpy and shrill, perilously reminiscent of John Adams, with guitars that jittered up and down arpeggios, and pianos that promised redemption. Its grand, naive sense of wonder and organized chaos perfectly suited the multicolor auditorium, where balconies squiggle around and curve upwards, lifting your gaze to boomerang-shaped panels suspended like aeroplane parts after a mid-air crash.Yorke made his first appearance of the night a surprise. In a haze of ambient noise shards, he entered midway into Chalmin’s “Particule nº 5—Particule nº 6” wearing a casual T-shirt and blazer. Nobody breathed a word. Chalmin sang, “There must be a place where it all makes sense” as Yorke cooed in angelic counterpoint to the Labèques’ sinister swoops and trills. It took a moment to place a strange tenor in his voice, because it was the tenor of a normal backing singer. Gone was the meek, wavering angst. Instead, a clear and even falsetto. It was impressive but unnerving, like seeing your scruffy friend show up at a wedding in a tailored suit.Act two began, and Yorke remained absent. His first composition, “Don’t Fear the Light,” was a three-part suite helmed by the Labèques. Its opening minutes, full of creeping keys and ambient gusts, failed to live up to the moment, treading too closely to the spookier tracks from his score for last year’s  remake. Then something crystallized. At first it sounded clunky, like a witchy cat sauntering across a piano. One key hammered ominously. Out of nowhere, a minor flourish scuttled free and disappeared in a dark flurry. The cat resumed its manic prowl, occasionally touching on a scatty motif I had internalized without realizing it.For five, 10 minutes, the piece pivoted between contemporary American serialism and European gothic, then staggered back to Russian anarchy. In diabolical moments, Katia sprung back as if a spirit had lurched from the piano and thumped her hard in the shoulder. The sisters played with monstrous energy, like anxious lovers gearing up for a quarrel. There was a strange symmetry where they finished each other’s sentences—and then, with no discernible change, became engaged in different conversations altogether. It was as if one piano was the dream and the other was reality, and Yorke’s score was abruptly shaking you awake.On the surface, the music was magnificent. But for anyone who’s followed Yorke’s trajectory through the last 25 years, it was also subconsciously familiar. So when the piece evolved further away from Radiohead’s catalog, in a sweep of Reichian hubbub and surging melody, some latent skepticism vanished. Just as brilliant was “Gawpers,” a shorter piece for which Yorke finally unleashed the voice we know. “Who put all the shit in your head?” he enquired in a tone of beleaguered majesty, conducting the pianists with metronomic flicks of his right hand. Behind him they tiptoed and lurched, alternately violent and sinister, twinkly and grotesque, before receding into silence.Once it was over, Yorke awkwardly bowed with hands on the sisters’ backs, like somebody re-enacting a gesture he has seen done but never imagined doing. Then he walked off, scratching his neck and staring at the floor. Upon returning for an encore, he cracked a defensive joke: “Now I’m gonna do some hip-hop covers.”Joined by Dessner and Chalmin, the band played “Suspirium,” from his  score, a charming waltz that they turned into a sensation. As Yorke surveyed the hall, the stalls rose in a standing ovation, which he had earned: On this night, for the first time in a long time, you could feasibly diagnose in him a faint itch for validation. Finally he relaxed into a boyish expression, which brought another rare image of Thom Yorke: a sweet, honest humility.",articles4,"['Thom Yorke', 'Yorke’s', 'La Monte Young', 'Katia', 'Marielle Labèque', 'John Adams', 'Yorke’s', 'Radiohead’s']"
"Listen to the track belowDrum’n’bass and jungle were supposed to be dead. At least that’s what the dance music cognoscenti told us for the better part of the past 15 years.Of course, this music never truly disappeared , and when it comes to electronic music, “dead” is often a relative term. In reality, it’s usually just a matter of time before the spotlight comes swinging back around. After all, now that trance—a genre that was once all but radioactive for most artists not named Tiësto—has come back into fashion, it's clear that all options are on the table.“Uprated Nite Zone” is a hyperactive jungle rumbler with seemingly anonymous origins, although a bit of investigation appears to indicate that it’s actually the work of Scottish duo Clouds, who’ve been making quality techno for the past decade. (They’ve also been exploring the joys of UK hardcore and, yes, trance as of late with their Headstrong label, which the pair run in tandem with London producer Randomer.)Last year, Clouds released an ambitious LP on Electric Deluxe called , a concept album set in a drug- and violence-ravaged future in which their hometown of Glasgow has been acquired by a German-speaking conglomerate that has incorporated the city into a new civic entity known as Neurealm.Although the Hamilton Scalpel 12"" has been released on a new imprint called Concrete Cabin, it’s billed as a “covert transmission from the outskirts of Neurealm,” an easter egg that recalls the mystery that characterized much of the early rave era. Nostalgic? Absolutely. But the music here is also raucous, full of energy, and, most importantly, fun. Furthermore, it sounds fresh, especially when its furiously shuddering percussion is held up against the rigid, identikit house and techno that’s being turned out in bulk these days.To be clear, the Hamilton Scalpel project isn’t some sort of outlier. Artists like dBridge, Alix Perez, and Sully are all making excellent drum’n’bass tunes, while labels such as Western Lore, Cosmic Bridge, and Astrophonica are just a few of the reliable hubs for these sounds. This music is in a particularly fertile place right now—leave it to the pundits to debate whether jungle is back from the grave or if tastemakers have simply started paying attention again.",articles4,"['Tiësto', 'Clouds', 'Clouds', 'Neurealm', 'Nostalgic', 'dBridge', 'Cosmic Bridge']"

Among top performers in the genre, the study concluded that male artists appeared on the charts at least twice as many times as female artists did during the five year sample period. The study also assessed longevity for both genders, and revealed that the average age for top performing male solo artists was 42. The average age for female artists of the same stature was 29.Additionally, the study found that across 200 songs on the country charts between 2014 and 2018, only 12% were written by women. During that same time period, only 15% of the  Academy of Country Music Awards nominees across four, non-gender specific categories (Entertainer of the Year, Songwriter of the Year, Duo of the Year, Group of the Year) were women.Read “How Lil Nas X’s ‘Old Town Road’ Became a Lightning Rod for Race, the Charts, and Country Music” on the Pitch.",articles4,[None]

"Listen to the track belowAll the controversy and conversation around Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” over the last few weeks has largely glossed over one important thing: the song is good. It is infectious country trap that doesn’t take anything too seriously. As Lil Nas X sings of decamping for the grasslands of an unsettled America and fleeing on horseback, he is playing up country-ness as a meme, sure, but also as an ideal, the cowboy mythos punctuated by his twangy, hammy performance. Billy Ray Cyrus, of all people, has joined forces with Lil Nas X to stick it to the country establishment on a new cut of “Old Town Road.” In X, he seems to think he’s found a kindred spirit. “When I got thrown off the charts, Waylon Jennings said to me ‘Take this as a compliment’ means you’re doing something great!” he tweeted this week. “Only Outlaws are outlawed. Welcome to the club!”While Billy Ray hopping on the remix lends a bit more credence to the idea that “Old Town Road” is a country song, his contribution is something of a detriment to the song itself. His part would be better played by someone a bit more spry in and out of cadences. His verse is out of lockstep with X’s, and his lines, about riding a Maserati down Rodeo Drive and buying his baby diamond rings and Fendi sports bras, miss the joke entirely: leaving big city modernity behind for simpler living, marrying the bravado of trap with escapist Western tropes (“Ridin’ on a horse/You can whip your Porsche/I been in the valley/You ain’t been up off that porch,” etc., etc.). For Cyrus, the song is merely an opportunity to position himself as a new type of outlaw. For Lil Nas X, it was always about wanting to “leave everything behind,” about freedom. They have much different agendas. Still, as they gallop side-by-side in the closing moments, at full throat, it’s hard not want to hop on a saddle of your own.",articles4,"['Lil Nas X’s', 'Billy Ray Cyrus', 'Lil Nas X', 'Waylon Jennings', 'Billy Ray', 'X’s']"

"Listen to the track belowPile’s new song kicks off on a buzz of frustrated chords like a revving engine. Once the drums come in, “The Soft Hands of Stephen Miller” hits fast and mean, a two-minute Molotov cocktail hurled towards the smarmy Trump aide known as the architect of the administration’s hardline immigration policies. On first pass, the Boston post-hardcore band’s frontman Rick Maguire sings with a fury that sounds inchoate: , he taunts, before turning to a more salient point: “Stephen, tell me about your great-grandmother.” Miller himself, as the public learned last year, is the descendant of refugees who fled anti-Jewish violence in Europe in the early 1900s.Not until halfway through this brutally short track do Pile bring in the full force of their guitars, as Maguire unleashes a long, glass-shattering howl of rage. “We’re all railing against insignificance, Steve/But you don’t have to be so vile and insufferable about it,” he sneers. And there’s the career of Stephen Miller in a nutshell: not that of an intellectual rebel but of a cruel, craven hanger-on.

"Zack Sabre Jr. is one of the best professional wrestlers in the world. The 31-year-old from the UK’s Isle of Sheppey is not a muscular or imposing figure, but he puts on wildly entertaining wrestling clinics countering his opponents’ brute force by tying them in knots. He’s made his name with almost no help from WWE—he wrestled a handful of matches there in 2016, but walked away and instead signed with New Japan Pro-Wrestling. In music terms, it’s the equivalent of turning down a major label contract and signing with one of the bigger indie labels. (Also, New Japan matches are  more fun.)For someone who excels in an industry that co-signed the nu-metal boom of the early ’00s, Sabre’s taste in music is pretty outstanding. Earlier this year, he shared a list of favorite 2018 records via the best-of list generator Buy Music Club. Look at the names on this list: DJ Koze, Octavian, MIKE, JPEGMAFIA, Jon Hopkins, Earl Sweatshirt, Snail Mail, GAS, Beach House, Jeff Rosenstock, Skee Mask, Grouper, Fucked Up, Low, No Age, Deafheaven, Playboi Carti, and more.“I'm just always seeking out new music,” Sabre told Pitchfork in a phone interview earlier this week. The job requires a significant amount of travel, and during that time, he puts on his headphones and goes on deep dives through Bandcamp and YouTube. “I mean, that's probably one of my favorite things to do. I can have a delayed flight and not even realize it’s been three hours because I'm just digging through stuff.”With WrestleMania weekend upon us—the weekend surrounding WWE’s Super Bowl where nearly every wrestling promotion runs a major show—Sabre has one of the most high-profile matches of his career tomorrow night (April 6): During the G1 Supercard at Madison Square Garden, he’ll defend his championship belt against the enormously popular “ace” of New Japan, Hiroshi Tanahashi. Ahead of that match, Sabre chatted with Pitchfork about his recent favorites and his pre-match listening habits.Cremation Lily’s Zen [Zsigo] is one of my closest friends, and at this point, he’s one of my biggest inspirations as well. He was the frontman of a screamo band 10 years ago called Maths who were really good. They were on Holy Roar. I saw them live, ‘cause one of my friends’ bands played with them. And then randomly, after an indie wrestling show that I did about 10 years ago that Daniel Bryan was on, I got a message on MySpace from Maths that said, “Hey I saw you wrestle last weekend, it was really good.” I remember being so excited. We’ve had a mutual appreciation and interest in each other’s careers.I’ve followed everything Zen’s done for the last decade. I’ve always been a huge wrestling fan since I was a child, so obviously my influences are from that, but equally or more as I get older, what inspires me as a performer is musicians or comedians or directors—things from outside of my world. Watching Zen as a frontman had a huge impact on me. He’s completely in his own environment, he’s being completely sincere, and he’s not trying to appease anybody. If you see him perform now, you know he’s from the hardcore scene.The underlying beat on “Aquarium,” I love. If you get to hear it on a proper sound system, it works in a club environment. That’s what I really love about electronic music—that space between club and headphones. Even if I’m on an airplane for the third international flight in a week, as soon as I’ve got headphones on, I’m transported. A lot of the influence on that record came from the South Kent coast, which isn’t too far from the Isle of Sheppey. It’s comforting to hear it. It’s influenced by the ocean and the coast, so it drowns out any other thoughts. It’s very relaxing for me.I love the whole  EP, but “Look How Hard I’ve Tried” just gets your attention straightaway. It really threw me back to when I first started getting into techno-leaning stuff—coming from being an indie kid, hearing Nathan Fake and James Holden, discovering the main Kompakt artists. It took me a few minutes to realize there’s no kick drum in it, which is wild, because it's such a layered song.I listen to it all the time. If I’m at home, I'll just be blaring it out upsetting my neighbors. I’m listening to it when I'm at the gym running. I have to play it on repeat. That’s one of those songs where it’s impossible to listen to anything else. Before matches, through airports, traveling. It sounds so indulgent, but if I’m on the train looking out the window, that’s when music really absorbs in.Barker remixed one of my favorite Blondes songs that I was obsessed with a couple years ago. I really enjoy following him on Twitter as well. He’s got some meaningful insights into the music industry. I’m solely a music fan, but the parallels between the wrestling business and the music industry are really interesting, like with intellectual rights and being credited for things.In wrestling interviews, you always get asked about pre-match rituals. I don’t really have anything, but then I remembered that an hour or two before I’m wrestling, I’m  listening to grime []. Logan Sama has a really good playlist, “KeepinItGrimy,” which updates with new grime, so I try to discover as much new grime as possible. But there’s something reassuring about a track that you know.Probably before every big match I’ve had in the last five years, I’ve listened to “Take Time.” It still sounds mind-boggling . The production on that is just unbelievable. Mumdance is one of the most fascinating people in dance music. Did you hear Bliss Signal? It’s Mumdance making a black metal record with the guy from Altar of Plagues. I love Novelist and Mumdance, they put out two of my favorite albums last year—the Bliss Signal album, and Novelist’s debut album was incredible, too.It’s just impossible not to just go back to this track. It’s classic. It sounds like EDM robots and noise explosions, and Novelist is so young but he’s got such a mature flow. I find it really inspiring. I’m lucky now I’m signed to the second-largest wrestling company in the world, but I’m inspired by that approach that the grime scene has—that thing of keeping their integrity while still willing to reach a larger audience. I love traveling and I love the places I get to go, but as a Brit traveling the world, there’s something comforting about listening to grime while I’m away.[] Yeah!

"Listen to the track belowThe release of the Spanish group Oso Leone’s new album, , comes at a strange, even inauspicious, time: Singer Xavier Marín’s breathy warble is a dead ringer for the halting whisper of Talk Talk’s Mark Hollis, the notoriously reclusive singer who died in late February, summoning an outpouring of grief. Talk Talk disbanded around 1991, and Hollis had been out of the public eye for two decades, but for a few days, it seemed everybody was talking about his band’s quiet, considered music.It’s difficult not to think about Hollis’ absence when listening to “Virtual U,” the opening song on . It’s not just Marín’s cracking falsetto or hesitant inflection; the music is steeped in the lush arrangements of Talk Talk at their dreamiest. A few weeks after Hollis’ death, Marín told a Spanish newspaper, “Mark Hollis’ music will always light our path. I feel like it’s living music; it mutates in time.” Appropriately, Oso Leone’s own music is as vibrant and verdant as hothouse flowers; far from its title, “Virtual U” feels humid, almost sticky, in its overwhelming sense of place. Lilting analog drum machines hiss like spring rain while vine-like guitars tremble in midair; the whole thing swims in synths, reverb, and suggestive sounds you can’t quite tease out from the swirl.There’s more than a little bit of early Sade here, too, which feels appropriate. Their music, like Talk Talk’s, made a quiet splash in Ibiza in the 1980s, where DJs forged the so-called Balearic style of left-field dance music; Oso Leone hail from Mallorca, Ibiza’s sister island, some 90 miles to the northeast. “I think that the fact that we come from an island influenced the fluidity of our artistic identity,” Marín told ; with “Virtual U,” these islanders bring the British sophisti-pop tradition back to its spiritual home in the Mediterranean.",articles4,"['Oso Leone’s', 'Xavier Marín', 'Talk Talk', 'Marín’s', 'Talk Talk', 'Marín', 'Oso Leone', 'Talk Talk’s', 'Ibiza', 'Balearic', 'Ibiza’s']"

"It’s not hard to imagine music journalists in the world of Alex Ross Perry’s new rock’n’roll drama, , breathlessly reporting on the antics of Becky Something (Elisabeth Moss) as writers did during Courtney Love’s chaotic reign. Moss’ fictional frontwoman was also once a drugged-out blonde leading a punkish ’90s rock band, a mother but not a madonna, a tornado that sweeps up and spits out her bandmates, fans, manager, and anyone in her orbit. Even at her high points, Becky’s always on the verge of eruption—a quality that made Love so enthralling to watch during her early album cycles. Likewise, Moss is all snarls and mischievous mugs, and seeing which one she serves at any given moment is part of the film’s disturbing thrill. is perhaps more of an uncomfortable watch than an enjoyable one, giving the viewer a front row seat to Becky’s destructive behavior. But it’s impossible to turn away from Moss, especially when she’s flashing that maniacal smile. For those who’ve recently seen Moss in Jordan Peele’s , her frightening mood switch from distant to frantic in that film reveals a tinge of Becky Something. If her behavior feels irrevocably doomed, the twist is that she seems to know it. In the film’s first performance from Something She, Becky’s band plays a cover of the Only Ones’ “Another Girl, Another Planet.” The first line? “I always flirt with death.” Becky whispers it twice before fully kicking into the song. Later, she tells her bandmate, “I’ve seen my death a dozen times in a dozen different ways.”In a 1998  cover story, Courtney Love compares herself to another infamous blonde: Madonna. She brings up the pop star’s then-recent  interview, in which she says she doesn’t have a self-destructive bone in her body. Love obviously can’t relate. “I have many and I’ve broken a bunch,” she says. In the same way, Becky Something is all self-destructive bones. Instead of punishing her for this, the film attempts to reassemble her, to find the soft flesh and tender heart that’s been there all along. The vérité documentation of that journey is exhilarating but grueling to sit through, especially when the film portrays her maternal instincts, or lack thereof. For a character who chose an unconventional career path, Becky’s failure at domesticity is still used as ’s biggest shock value. Becky’s journey toward responsible motherhood is rewarding, but there’s not enough about what actually made her a great rock star, let alone a songwriter.The structure and timeline of the film can partly be blamed for that. Staged in five real-time acts over the course of a decade or so,  is not a rise and fall story so much as a perpetual downward slope. Something She is some years in when the film opens, a bit past their early heyday of  covers and platinum records (which are romanticized via intermittent home video footage). Their fanbase is dwindling, their manager Howard (Eric Stoltz) is on his last credit line during a drawn-out recording process, and Becky is somehow isolating her collaborators even more. During a merciless session in the film’s second act, Becky pushes their drummer Ali (Gayle Rankin) to walk out and bassist Marielle (Agyness Deyn) to slap her. She vampirically attaches herself to her new saving grace, a rising baby band called the Akergirls (Chantal Akerman reference?), made up of real It Girls Cara Delevingne, Ashley Benson, and Dylan Gelula. She quite literally bites each of their necks before inviting them to jam, now cutting into another band’s studio time. centers around a flirtation with death (including many career suicides), but it is also about rebirth, one that comes with its own uncertainties. At her lowest, Becky unsuccessfully tries to exorcise her demons by hiring a fraudulent shaman whom she calls Ya-ema, even though his real name is Alvin. It’s worth noting that he is the film’s only character of color, and even with the tokenism, this is somewhat of an improvement for the typically tone deaf and whitewashed worlds of Alex Ross Perry films (when the indie director last turned up, with 2017’s , he made modern-day Brooklyn look glaringly pale). Thanks to Ya-ema’s misguiding, Becky is led to believe a false prophecy: her own child will be her downfall. She subsequently throws a fit backstage trying to get her infant to vacate the premises, all while her ex-husband (Dan Stevens) and his new girlfriend bend helplessly to her chaos.Everyone puts up with Becky more than seems tolerable, the vague reason being that she wasn’t always such a nightmare. But the viewer never sees the cause of her downward spiral and is left to assume it’s some sort of drug abuse, which Becky confirms much later on. Perry is interested almost exclusively in the effect her addiction has on everyone around her; , the Hole album title, comes to mind, with Becky serving as the “this” for those in her life. And yet, she is given chance after chance after chance. “You were horrible but it never made me not love you,” Marielle tells Becky when they reunite years later, in present day. By that point Becky is sober but still temperamental, and the last scene isn’t exempt from the thrumming anxiety that runs through the film.“I think that self-destructiveness can also mean self-reflection, can mean poetic sensibility,” Love says in that  interview. “It can mean an empathy, it can mean a hedonism and a libertarianism and lack of judgment.” Ultimately,  is an empathetic film that pushes self-destruction to its final lifeline and leaves no choice but self-reflection. Becky may always be flirting with death, but she’s given a new will to live. opens in New York on April 12, with nationwide screenings to follow.",articles4,"['Becky Something', 'Courtney Love’s', 'Becky’s', 'Becky’s', 'Jordan Peele', 'Becky’s', 'Courtney Love', 'Madonna', 'Becky’s', 'Becky’s', 'Eric Stoltz', 'Everyone', 'Marielle', 'Becky']"

"The “Empire” actor’s charges of felony disorderly conduct were dropped in March“Empire” actor Jussie Smollett was charged with 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct, and then in an unexpected turn of events in March, all of those charges were dropped. The judge sealed the case and Smollett’s record was expunged. Now, Chicago is planning to sue Smollett after he allegedly refused to pay over $130,000 in reimbursement to the city for costs of the investigation, Associated Press and TMZ report.On March 28, the City of Chicago and the Chicago Police Department sent a letter to Smollett’s lawyer demanding $130,106 to repay the police for the “substantial overtime hours” spent on the investigation. Smollett was given seven days to make his payment, but failed to do so in time according to the City Law Department. In response, the department is reportedly preparing a lawsuit in civil court to be filed “in the near future.”Chicago plans to pursue “the full measure of damages allowed under the ordinance” of the suit. Because the municipal code stipulates that the city can triple the amount originally demanded when the initial payment is missed, Smollett could owe up to $390,000.The news of the Smollett’s charges being dropped was met with backlash in Chicago. Mayor Rahm Emanuel called the dismissal a “whitewash of justice” and criticized the actor for not showing remorse for the “moral and ethical wrong of his actions.” The prosecutor, First Assistant Cook County State’s Attorney Joseph Magats, said, “I do not believe he is innocent.”Jussie Smollett was charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. On January 29, it was reported that Jussie Smollett had been attacked in Chicago by two men. Police initially investigated the incident as a hate crime; Smollett claimed his assailants called him homophobic and racist slurs, put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him, and yelled “this is MAGA country” before fleeing.Two men, identified as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, were arrested and questioned by police in connection with the alleged attack on February 13. Two days later, Smollett was categorized as a suspect in the case after the Osundairos were released without criminal charges.After being charged, Smollett turned himself in on February 21. He later pled not guilty. Days following the charges, “Empire” producers announced that Smollett would not participate in the final two episodes of the show’s current season.",articles4,"['Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Police Department', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Jussie Smollett', 'Abimbola Osundairo', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett']"

"Listen to the track belowAs a rule, Hot Chip songs are informed by house and disco, yet they’ve also kept themselves at a slight remove from actual club music. For one thing, their melodies are too big, too ebullient to abide by the constraints of more narrowly functionalist dance music. Even a song like “Ready for the Floor,” despite its title, didn’t so much plunge into the dancefloor as hover above it, marveling at its strangeness, as though the club were a brightly lit aquarium filled with fantastically colored fish.But with “Hungry Child,” Hot Chip dive into the scrum with abandon. (The upcoming album it’s taken from is called , which may or may not tell you everything you need to know.) This is a dance-music aficionado’s record par excellence, a collage of hallowed tropes: moody Reese bass, flashing piano stabs, gospel-house vocal harmonies, even squirrelly little synth riffs reminiscent of Isolée. But Hot Chip’s genius has always lain in the singularity of their sound, and that’s true here, too, as Alexis Taylor’s yearning warble (“Dreaming never felt so bad/Lonely never felt so wrong before”) meets the band’s muscular four-to-the-floor throb, creating a sound that’s as playful as it is lovelorn. Much of the best dance music has been born of desperation, and on “Hungry Child,” Hot Chip channel despair into a floor-filler of surprising pathos.",articles4,"['Hot Chip', 'Isolée', 'Taylor’s', 'Hot Chip']"
"In February, after some delay, Spotify launched in India. For the global  music business, the country that birthed bhangra and Bollywood looks like a vast untapped market. With a population of 1.3 billion people and only about 6% of them currently streaming music, India’s recording industry would seem to have ample room for growth. By the end of Spotify’s first week on the subcontinent, the streaming company had signed up 1 million users, including both paid and ad-supported.As worldwide music brands move into India and other so-called emerging markets, most notably China, recent history suggests the cultural exchange won’t only go one direction. With the spread of streaming across Latin America, songs like “Despacito” and “Mi Gente” have sprung up from regional playlists to become massive international hits. Will something similar happen again, next time with music local to Delhi or Beijing?Willard Ahdritz, founder and CEO of music services juggernaut Kobalt, is upbeat on the idea. “With the globalization of music, it is clear that a global hit will come from China or India in the next couple of years, if not sooner,” he says. “These territories are already producing high-quality music to pair with well-produced videos, and they’re getting better access to internet bandwidth. The tough part is that to make a song global, it will have to be executed flawlessly and have a compelling audio-visual element, but the opportunity is there for someone to grab it.”The basic template for a cross-border streaming hit predates the recent Latin hip-hop boom, and it stands apart from the Western success of someone like PSY, whose “Gangnam Style” ruled YouTube when Spotify’s current algorithms were still a twinkle in some chipmaker’s eyes. When German house producer Robin Schulz released a remix of Dutch rapper Mr. Probz’s then-new song “Waves” in 2013, it went to No. 1 right away throughout Europe. But Schulz’s “Waves” remix didn’t become a Top 40 hit in America until months later. This successful invasion of the U.S. charts, Spotify contended, was thanks to its own curated playlists.It wasn’t long before other streaming-driven hits took a similar path around the globe. English-language international hits were one thing, but a big breakthrough came in 2017, when Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s “Despacito” and then J Balvin and Willy Williams’ “Mi Gente”—buoyed by guest appearances from Justin Bieber and Beyoncé, respectively—went from No. 1 on most Latin American charts to the top 10 of the Hot 100. Those songs were also the first tracks by Latinx artists to hit No. 1 on Spotify.The general pattern tends to go something like this: Songs gain traction on local playlists and on YouTube. Streaming algorithms notice this activity and put the songs on more and more prominent playlists. Rinse, repeat. Eric Fritschi, an executive at Mtheory, a company that consults with artist managers, has suggested that hits from China and India could also follow this path. “Traditional Chinese music and Bollywood are likely going to explode globally at any moment,” Fritschi told  recently.Speaking with Pitchfork, Fritschi strikes a more measured tone, but he’s still enthusiastic—particularly about the prospects for Indian music. He points out that three out of the top five artists on YouTube globally are from India: Neha Kakkar, Kumar Sanu, and Alka Yagnik. “We’ve got the gasoline,” Fritschi says. Spotify’s entrance into the market exposes Indian listeners’ tastes to its own algorithms. “And we’ve got the spark.” All that remains is for an Indian musician to spread across the planet like proverbial wildfire.China may pose a more complicated challenge for the global music industry. The country’s Great Firewall restricts local access to foreign websites, including YouTube. Apple Music has launched there, but not Spotify, although the Swedish company does own a stake in China’s most popular streaming service, Tencent. Still, it’s easy to find signs of American music-business thirst for this market and its global diaspora, whether it’s Chinese singer Lay Zhang’s attendance at this year’s Grammys as an official “ambassador,” or Apple Music’s Chinese New Year playlists curated by Zhang and other Chinese stars. China’s 1.4 billion people already stream music and use smartphones at much higher rates than people in India; some analysts forecast China to be the biggest revenue-growth market for streaming in the coming years. Just last year, China joined the world’s top 10 biggest music markets in the industry’s official rankings.But for a Chinese hit to leap over the Great Firewall and onto worldwide playlists would require a route beyond the established one-two punch of YouTube and Spotify. The popular lip-sync app TikTok, Fritschi notes, is available on both sides of the Great Firewall and might be a way for music to spread from China to international audiences. “That could be a game changer,” he says. After all, TikTok is already generating many a meme in America.Also worth noting is the fact that Tencent generates most of its revenue not from Spotify-style streaming, but from its karaoke and video live-streaming apps. It certainly seems possible that American audiences could increasingly embrace similar apps, as well—and arguably, they already are. “There’s so much growth left in streaming,” Fritschi says. “What’s going to bring in your mom and your grandma, your aunts and your uncles? It could be karaoke.”The Great Firewall represents more than a mere business problem. As with every other industry angling for the Chinese market, the recording business will have to make difficult decisions involving human rights—decisions that are all the more salient for an industry that’s supposedly founded on free creative expression. Chinese artists who have spoken out against the official Communist party line, including Hong Kong’s Denise Ho, have notoriously seen their mainland career opportunities vanish.As music continues to spread beyond borders, listeners are spoiled with choice. But as with globalizing markets in any industry, more selection also means more competition. “It’s exciting stuff as a music fan,” says Michael Sloane, CEO of music placement and promotion company Streaming Promotions, “and  on the recording industry front, because the barrier to entry is already low, and now it’s low for the globe.” But he’s also optimistic about Spotify’s foray into India. In particular, he’s curious to see how Bollywood might be influenced by all of the music available on Spotify: “How will that change a typical Bollywood track into something that is palatable for a U.S. audience?”Pleasing American listeners is not necessarily the end goal of every international artist, and there are economic and human-rights issues to consider as well when looking ahead to streaming’s borderless future. But the prospect of truly globe-straddling hits could mean a chance to enjoy more musical hybrids, amid this new cycle of influencing and being influenced. When you look at it that way, the possibilities seem near-endless, and the whole wide world seems a little closer to home.",articles4,"['Spotify', 'Mr. Probz’s', 'Luis Fonsi', 'Daddy Yankee’s', 'Willy Williams’', 'Those', 'Neha Kakkar', 'Kumar Sanu', 'Alka Yagnik', 'Lay Zhang’s', 'Zhang', 'Hong Kong’s Denise']"

"It is categorically rude to dig up a writer’s college newspaper column from decades ago and parade it around for all to see. But when that writer is a folksy, polyglot presidential candidate who once pined for the simpler times when he could listen to Dave Matthews Band and not have to think about 9/11—well, it’s still rude, but at least it’s fair game.Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a rising political star. Buttigieg announced he’d entered into the Democratic presidential primary in January, just days after his 37th birthday. Along with his mayorship, which he’s held since 2012, Buttigieg’s résumé includes a B.A. from Harvard, an M.A. from Oxford’s Pembroke College, and the rank of lieutenant in the U.S. Navy Reserve. He speaks in the ballpark of eight languages.He was also, sorry to say, a political columnist for his college paper. In November 2003, when Buttigieg was a senior at Harvard, his bi-weekly op-ed for the school’s newspaper  turned its eye toward the popular music of the day. In a column titled “Rock the Vote?,” Buttigieg wrote about the music heard around the Harvard campus for the past four years and reflected on the heady political times of the Bush administration, the September 11 attacks, and the pulse of the new millennium. (How 9/11 reframed Buttigieg’s life is a theme he comes back to often in his new book .)The column begins—as any good political column should—discussing Dave Matthews’ 2003 debut solo LP  and—as any adroit op-ed writer would do—compares it to Radiohead’s :This week, I picked up a new album by Dave Matthews, prophet of the
carefree joy of my high school years. But unlike the cheerful strains
of late-nineties-Dave, the solo project  is a sober, even
grim reflection of how much the world has changed in a few short
years. The man who brought us the playful riffs of “Too Much” and
“Everyday” is now promoting the album’s first single, “Gravedigger.”
Matthews is not the only one undergoing a tonal shift; if you’ve paid
attention to Radiohead this year, you know that they have grown not
only darker, but more explicitly political. In titling their new
project, for example, they replaced the cryptic inclinations that
brought us previous efforts like or , and called this one .Buttigieg moves on to talk about the halcyon days of listening to Dave Matthews Band before 9/11, when the worries of the world seemed smaller and when, according to him, “Saddam was a joke, Anthrax was a metal band, [and] Afghanistan was a place where, in commercials, shepherds were using the internet to improve business.” By Buttigieg’s reckoning, the hoary strains of Sting’s 1999 album  represent a lost bastion of idyllic globalism.However, my eyes are drawn to this paragraph, the big turn, when everything changed for Buttigieg and America and the way we collectively listened to those early Dave Matthews Band records:Then all hell broke loose. Just as we were adjusting to the fact that
our country could function even if the president didn’t completely
know what he was doing, a team of Saudis with box cutters torpedoed
our innocence. Right then, like our cell phones, our culture stopped
working for a minute. What sense could the old Dave Matthews make when
Dave Letterman was weeping on air?Florid as this may seem, it’s true that in the days following the attacks, DMB’s titanic 1996 ballad “Crash Into Me” was actually removed from some radio station playlists because the title alone might remind the nation of its trauma.In his column, Buttigieg goes on to talk about how several bands specifically marked this change from light to dark within a tumultuous political and cultural landscape. Music of the early ’00s was more acerbic, more politically efficacious, he writes, as embodied by Eminem’s 2002 album  “He warned young Americans to think about a draft, joked about Dick Cheney’s cardiac health, and lashed out at the ‘Divided States of Embarrassment’ for abandoning free speech.”In closing he ponders the state of the national mood in the upcoming 2004 election:So one year from now, when the notoriously apathetic youth of America
is asked to participate in the choosing of our national leadership,
we’ll owe ourselves a few thoughts about how and why our national
voice changed so quickly from a hopeful Dave Matthews telling us that
“All you need is every day” to an unwell Radiohead wondering why “two
plus two always makes five.”It’s overly earnest and it’s dated, but none of Buttigieg’s writing or thought process is clownable or as embarrassing as, say, Vice President Mike Pence once writing that he was “victimized” by Disney’s . Say what you will about using Dave Matthews or Radiohead or Eminem as flashpoints of a great cultural shift, but a few tortured metaphors aside, Buttigieg’s column is a good window into the storied form of political music writing. Change the bands, change the president, and a piece like Buttigieg’s could well be written today.",articles4,"['South Bend', 'Indiana', 'Buttigieg', 'Buttigieg’s', 'Buttigieg', 'Buttigieg’s', 'Radiohead’s', 'Radiohead', 'Dave Matthews Band', '9/11', 'Anthrax', 'Sting’s', 'Dave Matthews Band', 'DMB’s', 'Americans', 'Dick Cheney’s', 'America\n', 'Radiohead', 'Buttigieg’s', 'Disney’s', 'Buttigieg’s', 'Buttigieg’s']"

"Music fandom is so often thought of as an intimate experience, but for much of history, songs have served as a type of glue holding humanity together. There’s a unifying force in enjoying music with other people, whether it’s in the context of the traditional concert setting or the (even more traditional) spheres of religion and activism. Music can be the tie that binds friends and strangers to one another like nothing else, transcending boundaries of race, gender, class, space, and time itself.This notion serves as the foundation of , a massive box set released earlier this year by Smithsonian Folkways. The collection includes familiar American protest songs like “This Land Is Your Land” and “If I Had a Hammer” alongside polkas, prayers, gospel tunes, and more from around the globe. At a moment when American culture feels splintered, these songs may remind you of the resistance and healing that music has brought to other periods of distress and uncertainty throughout history, whether at home or abroad. Each of the songs played some kind of role in unifying people, either through calls to action or restorative affirmations. Below are the stories behind five of them.In Algeria, “Inno Della Resistenza” has another title and another role: “Kassaman,” which translates to “the pledge” in Arabic, currently serves as the country’s national anthem. What began as a song of underground rebellion ultimately became a song that “helped crystallize the concept of a nation,” according to Nabil Boudraa, who grew up in Algeria and now teaches French and Francophone studies at Oregon State University.This recording, sung by an anonymous chorus of fighters in the National Liberation Front (or the FLN), dates to 1962—the same year that Algeria finally won its independence after more than seven years of war, and nearly a century and a half of brutal French colonization. There are still many Algerians alive who remember the days before independence, giving the song particularly strong resonance. “Algeria is using this anthem in a much bigger sense, with much more feeling, with much more devotion. I don’t think other countries have the same intense relationship with their national anthems,” Boudraa says.Moufdi Zakaria, an Algerian poet and activist, wrote the lyrics in 1955 while imprisoned in Algiers for his political beliefs. His bloody but prideful words were later set to music composed by Egypt’s Mohamad Fawzi. “Of course, [the lyrics] are violent in some places, but [anthems] are all like that,” Boudraa says. “You think about ‘La Marseilleise,’ the French anthem, it’s exactly the same thing. It’s about independence, liberty, freedom—you have to fight for it, die for it, and so forth. It’s the same thing in this song.”Fannie Lou Hamer is better known for her essential work as a voting rights and civil rights activist than as a musician. But in 2015, Smithsonian Folkways released , a collection of field recordings made in 1963 of Hamer singing mostly spiritual and gospel songs used in the civil rights movement. “Woke Up This Morning” is a reworked version of a hymn, which originally began, “Woke up this morning with my mind stayed on Jesus.”“It’s easy to get people to go along with you when they know [the music],” says Mary D. Williams, a gospel singer and scholar focusing on the connections between music and the civil rights movement. “Every African-American that sung that song knew exactly where it came from, and exactly what they were singing about.”Hamer’s version of “Woke Up This Morning” originates with Rev. Robert Wesby of Aurora, Illinois. He came up with the rendition in June 1961, while jailed in Mississippi for being a Freedom Rider. The song found local popularity and later that fall, a group of students sang it as they walked out of Burglund High School in protest of the murder of a SNCC activist. The song became enshrined in civil rights history from there.“‘Woke Up this Morning’ is a song that reinforces this entire approach to the movement,” Williams says. “The intentionality of ‘my mind stayed on freedom’—in other words, to get up and still have a decision made that we’re going to keep going.”Born into a family of progressive Jewish intellectuals, Folkways co-founder Moses Asch followed suit by beginning his career recording and releasing contemporary and traditional Jewish music. When Asch founded Folkways in 1948 with Marian Distler, it was important to him that the label celebrate the culture of his faith, particularly in the wake of the war. “Being a Polish Jew himself, [Asch] saw the vibrancy of the Jewish community in the early 20th century, and also witnessed the destruction of that community through World War II,” says Meredith Holmgren, who curated the fourth disc of .That interest in preserving Jewish history inspired the release of albums like Abraham Brun’s , from 1965. Brun had survived the Łódź Ghetto in Poland, where Nazis forced more than 100,000 Jews into hard labor before sending many to concentration camps. Following the war, Brun settled in Long Beach, New York, where he became a well-known cantor, leading prayers and liturgical music at a local synagogue. He sings in Yiddish on , offering up clear-eyed declarations against Nazi oppression, like on “Why We Need Cry?” “Let us be merry and let us tell jokes/We will rejoice over the funeral of Hitler,” Brun sings, closing each stanza with a playful interjection of “biri-bam-bam.”“What’s so great about this track is that it’s a song of resiliency,” Holmgren says. “It’s both documenting the pain and struggle of a community, but also the ability of that community to resist and overcome.”Andrés Jiménez is a titanic figure in Puerto Rican folk culture, earning the title of “El Jíbaro” for his relatable connection to his homeland. “ is a word that refers to the poor peasants who had to move to New York because of the lack of work opportunity on the Puerto Rican island,” says Ilan Stavans, the acclaimed Latinx scholar and author. “[Jiménez] became very celebrated in part because he made the same transition that so many others had to do, carrying certain motifs and images with him that became very popular.”Chief among those motifs is the unusual relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico, which has been a U.S. territory for more than a century. Puerto Ricans are American citizens, but they have no voting power in Congress or say in national elections. “[Puerto Ricans] are in an internal migration. They aren’t traditional immigrants the way other Latin Americans are,” Stavans says. “Jiménez talks a lot about the social conditions in which Puerto Ricans live in New York City, the racism of American white society, some gender tension as well.”Calls for a change in Puerto Rico’s status—either for statehood or complete independence—have become increasingly popular in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and the American government’s slow, subpar aid efforts. Jiménez was rallying for the cause back in 1978 when he released . “El Pobre Sigue Sufriendo,” from that album, takes the rich to task for their lives of luxury, all while the poor toil without relief. “The cycles remain—that’s why Jiménez is such a lasting figure,” Stavans adds.In the mid-’60s, as the American civil rights movement was at fever pitch, Indonesia was embroiled in its own political and social crises. Following a failed coup by what was thought to be the Indonesian Communist Party in 1965, the New Order regime jailed and killed hundreds of thousands of people they suspected to be communists. That ongoing tragedy inspired “Hidup di Bui (Life in Jail),” an account of conditions in an infamous prison, Tangerang, by an anonymous author. The lyrics paint a picture of dire conditions, in which corn is rationed for meals and cigarettes are made from discarded butts and newspaper scraps. Because the song cited Tangerang specifically, the New Order regime banned the song.“The government thought that it would make a big difference to people if the song mentioned that location, which people knew was a place where political prisoners were held,” says Andrew Weintraub, a professor of music at the University of Pittsburgh. “It was seen as very threatening to have that one word in it.”In the ’70s, a pop band by the name of D’Lloyd recorded their own version of “Hidup Di Bui,” but under threat of retaliation from the government, the band changed the line about Tangerang into one that implicated “jails in wartime” and “jails during the Japanese occupation,” according to the liner notes for 1991’s  The version of “Hidup Di Bui” that appears there and on  has a slightly more traditional arrangement, with the original lyrics intact. The genre, gambang kromon, was once widely popular in Indonesia, but is now considered more of an amalgamated folk genre that includes indigenous Betawi, Chinese, Portuguese, and Malay influences.",articles4,"['Liberation Front', 'Algiers', '”“It’s', 'Abraham Brun’s', 'Puerto Rico’s', 'Jiménez', 'Indonesia', 'Party', 'Portuguese']"
"Long-running programs will close as company “phases out the existing structure”Red Bull Music Academy is to shut down after 21 years, the company announced in a statement Wednesday (April 3). Red Bull, an unlikely patron of underground music since the academy’s launch in 1998, said that RBMA and Red Bull Radio would close on October 31 in a move to “phase out the existing structure” and decentralize its operations in the creative industry. Yadastar, the marketing and consultancy company that partnered with Red Bull to develop RBMA, said in a statement that the companies had “mutually agreed to part ways.”RBMA had long been held up as an apparently sustainable model for corporate partnership with artists. Acts including Flying Lotus, SOPHIE, Objekt, and Nina Kraviz benefitted to various degrees from a broad infrastructure that included international concerts and festivals as well as access to high-end equipment and studios. The funding model emulated some benefits of the traditional record label system without putting a premium on mainstream appeal, some pundits argued, despite wariness in underground music of brand tie-ins, particularly given Red Bull’s heavy branding at dance events. RBMA also ran an editorial platform and long-running lecture series, which featured talks with D’Angelo, Björk, and many more alternative music figures. Red Bull will continue to operate a decentralized music arm, Red Bull Music, without Yadastar’s involvement.In a statement to Resident Advisor, Red Bull said:After 20 years of supporting artists worldwide with its music program
in a rapidly changing world, Red Bull will maintain its purpose of
providing a global platform to promote creativity—but it is changing
the means of delivery. Red Bull will be moving away from a strongly
centralized approach, will gradually phase out the existing structure
and will implement a new setup which empowers existing Red Bull
country teams and utilizes local expertise. Red Bull will continue to
explore new ways to support promising and cutting-edge artists
wherever they may be.Yadastar wrote on Twitter:https://twitter.com/yadastar/status/1113394592609652736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw",articles4,"['Red Bull', 'Red Bull', 'Flying Lotus', 'SOPHIE', 'Nina Kraviz', 'Red Bull’s', 'Björk', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull']"

"Listen to the track belowAfter the expedited February release of the  album, Ariana Grande has now dropped “Monopoly,” a new impromptu song with longtime collaborator and friend Victoria Monét, who holds co-writing credits on both “thank u, next” and “7 rings.” Born from the desire to bring her fans into her life by being off-the-cuff and unconstrained, “Monopoly” is pure unfettered fun. As Grande and Monét switch places singing in a garbled Auto-Tune, they roll off hyper-specific bars that would make any Arianator leap to prove that they know the backstory to all the references. They brag about the drunken writing sessions that bore , scoff at the large percent of royalties allotted to Rogers & Hammerstein from their -sampling hit “7 rings,” and bicker about a  scene. They even drop unsubtle hints about their sexuality, as both Monét and Grande sing, “I like women and men,” sparking discussion of Ariana’s possible bisexuality. (Responding directly to a fan on Twitter who said “Ariana ain’t gotta label herself,” Ari wrote: “i haven’t before and still don’t feel the need to now.”)The cool casualness of “Monopoly” extends to its instantly meme-able visual, directed by Alfredo Flores and Ariana’s ex Ricky Alvarez (also of “thank u, next” fame). Partially filmed on old ’90s camcorders, it borrows from the hilarious dance Instagram videos of Donté Colley (who is featured in the clip), in which he edits heartfelt positive messages and emoji hearts launching from his self-choreographed moves. The “Monopoly” vid is so different from the fantastical, expensive visuals that Grande usually puts out, her fans have even criticized it for being too “low-budget.” But as she trots around in a pink onesie and dusts the literal word “Fuckery” from her ponytail, Grande seems like she couldn’t give one single fuck.

The new single from  vanishes into the DeMarco catalog’s hall of mirrors, never finding its way out of the loop. DeMarco always lazes through songs, if not drowsy then slightly disengaged. But his best music is dryly conversational in a way that’s disarming. ’s minimalism was anchored by some of his strongest writing, and at times it felt a touch more personal, too. Here, DeMarco’s simplistic approach comes off as lazy and redundant. At the open, the warbly guitar tone that in recent years has given way to acoustics dissolves, meandering into platitudinous reflections on lost time and unfulfilled dreams. “Holding on/An image of a memory/Another song/All of our yesterdays are gone now,” DeMarco sings.

"That Franco Rosso’s  should be given a U.S. release at this time, nearly 40 years after the film premiered in the UK, is particularly poignant. It’s a dark, uncompromising drama set in the subculture of London’s reggae sound systems, originally framed as a comment on the innate polarization of life in the capital during the 1970s. However, the plotline’s swift descent into chaos from which neither side can return could so easily serve as a present-day metaphor for Britain’s Brexit mayhem or aspects of Donald Trump’s White House.  has stood the test of time precisely because those problems never went away, just changed their clothes and started dancing to a different beat.The film was conceived as a BBC Play For Today, a slot for one-off dramas often with a socio-political bent, but Rosso realized it could be bigger than that. A wise choice, as it’s doubtful the BBC would have gone with a vision as hard-nosed as his and anything less visceral would have rendered the story pretty much pointless. The potentially incendiary effect of the underdog fighting back, presented in such instinctively identifiable terms—during peak punk rock and Thatcher years, practically every UK urbanite under 30 knew someone like protagonist Blue—is, apparently, what caused U.S. distributors to back away from the film for so long.  should wear that fact as a badge of honor as it takes its rightful place alongside  and  as one of the best reggae films ever made. It continues its spread this spring thanks to screenings nationwide, with a physical/streaming release expected in the fall.On the surface,  follows a roots reggae sound system crew, Ital Lion, as its members prepare for a sound clash against the reigning area group. Fueled by Ital Lion’s onslaught of previously unheard and totally unmatchable 12-inch singles, this quest to be the best becomes almost a subplot. Rosso instead shows us this life through the lens of Blue, Ital Lion’s charismatic DJ. Pressures in Blue’s world spiral through police harassment, an openly racist employer, and violently hostile neighbors, to a point where the sound system, his only escape hatch, comes under threat. It’s a neat juggling act, as sound system members absorb Blue’s stresses but still get on with the day-to-day business of winning the clash and the single-mindedness that involves. The DJ’s escalating do-or-die state of affairs lends a compelling urgency to what is, essentially, “our records are better than yours.”As relevant as the socio-political commentary is,  left such a deep impression because the sound system rivalry story took on the feel of a thriller. This is, essentially,  for a dubwise audience. Rosso left nothing to chance, creating a world so complete and so compelling, it’s impossible to look away. Even the overt and, to 21st-century ears, unbelievably offensive racism becomes such a natural part of the overall tapestry, the film needs to be continually ramped up to get a reaction.Rosso nails the scruffy, edgy part of London, filming in actual locations around Deptford, an area rife with racial tension (but with none of the perceived romance of Brixton). There weren’t enough unionized black or elderly extras to populate various scenes so locals were roped in to “just act naturally”: the people in the pub are real customers in a real taproom, just as the guys milling around the Job Centre are actually looking for work. This creates a wash of random dishevelment no set dressing or wardrobe could get near, added to which are the candidly shot street scenes that have an almost bewildering level of unpredictability and overcrowding.  never has to work too hard to convince the audience of its authenticity.The real skill comes in the painstaking observation of the central characters—the Ital Lion posse, the rival sound system, and the ghetto businessmen they have to deal with. Too often, actors portraying music people reduce subcultures to varying sets of clichés. Black music, especially when handled in the UK, tends to cause even more problems. The casting of Brinsley Forde, former child TV actor and then-leader of foremost UK roots reggae band Aswad, as Blue led the way. There was little he wouldn’t have known about the London sound system circuit, its rivalry and paranoia, the importance of a unique tune, and the band of brothers mentality at the heart of such an operation. Indeed, it was was Forde and Aswad who wrote and performed the iconic dub at the centre of the story, called “Warrior Charge.”Ital Lion’s on-screen rival was legendary London soundman Jah Shaka playing himself, while others from London’s reggae fraternity–promoters, MCs, managers–carried out their day jobs in front of the cameras. The actors were the cream of London’s emerging black TV and stage talent, undoubtedly familiar with the sound system world on a social level in the same way practically every black teenager was. (A fair degree of nightclub apartheid was in operation in London in the 1970s.) Rosso, who was of Italian descent, allowed the actors nearly free rein with their characters. All of young, black London life got represented in terms of dress code and attitude, even tribes within tribes. As obvious as this seems for a filmmaker, in the UK (and beyond) dramatic presentation still leans toward “all black people are this... they look like that... and they behave like this”; in 1980, Rosso’s approach was a revelation.Perhaps most importantly, this nuanced depiction of Ital Lion isn’t let down by the music on their turntable. A playlist of superb rebel reggae, with another tune from Aswad, is supplemented with a touch of lovers rock and some lively roots humor, showing the scope of ’70s reggae to be as varied as its audience. What elevates  is the incidental music scored by UK dub master Dennis Bovell, leader of Matumbi and LKJ’s Dub Band, and previously a sound system operator himself. Although plentiful, it seldom grabs attention but still provides an irresistible reggae soundbed, helping to reposition the grubby, hostile South London streets as Blue’s own.Lloyd Bradley is the author of , originally published in the UK as .",articles4,"['Rosso’s', 'London’s', 'Thatcher', 'Blue—', 'Ital Lion’s', 'Ital Lion’s', 'Blue’s', 'Blue’s', 'Aswad', 'Jah Shaka', '–', 'London’s', 'Rosso’s', 'Ital Lion', 'Dennis Bovell', 'Blue’s']"

"An example of commercial EDM at its flashiest, Miami’s Ultra Music Festival is a place where spectacle goes hand in hand with excess, and self-aggrandizement is a feature, not a bug. Five years ago, when Avicii’s emergency hospitalization forced the then-24-old DJ to cancel his headlining set at Ultra, the Avicii Hotel pop-up shop remained open for business. There were branded golf carts, branded ice cream, branded beach towels, even branded condoms (though using one of those condoms in an Avicii-branded hotel room would set you back $865, plus tax). Much like the big-ticket holograms now haunting live music, the Avicii Hotel became, however inadvertently, a symbol of the ailing star’s absence. It also served as a reminder that at Ultra, entertainment isn’t simply a product—the product itself is the entertainment.Still, a line finally may have been crossed at this year’s Ultra when Kentucky Fried Chicken sent out Colonel Sanders to DJ a brief set. It wasn’t the real Colonel Harland David Sanders, of course; the iconic entrepreneur and brand ambassador died in 1980. But there was no mistaking the big-headed caricature that took the festival’s main stage, from his signature black-string bow tie to the white hair and pert Van Dyke beard that formed part of the DJ’s oversized helmet—an obvious riff on deadmau5’s mammoth rodent noggin. In fact, one Colonel Sanders was right there on the official lineup, scheduled for a five-minute set at 5:35 p.m. on Friday, March 29.https://twitter.com/1001TLtv/status/1111770287853338624The set’s cringe-inducing nature is evident in a video from the Ultra livestream, captured by 1001Tracklists. “Hello Kentucky!” cries an amplified voice as a by-the-numbers EDM beat pulses with bludgeoning big-room snares and the candy-colored swirl of “Levels”-inspired synth pads. “I am Colonel Sanders! I am everywhere!” he shouts ominously, in an unconvincing Southern accent. “Hey there, are you all hungry for some beats?” The rhythm builds to a thundering drop punctuated by a single chicken squawk, and the phrase “FINGER LICKIN’ GOOD” explodes across the LED screen, like some kind of hellish chyron from an all-too-imaginable near-future where our corporate overlords control every last pixel of information. The video is only one minute and 21 seconds long, but even so, it seems interminable; it’s hard to imagine what the full five minutes must have felt like to anyone who actually endured it. The crowd’s reaction in the clip is notably lackluster: As the camera pans, many attendees stand stock still; a rainbow-maned unicorn looks particularly deflated.Though neither KFC nor Ultra have commented, there is no plausible explanation except that this was a paid advertisement. The mind reels at the thought of the chain of decisions that led to this thing: The suits in a room, hypothesizing that Ultra’s afternoon crowd could give two shits about greasy chicken. The masked DJ, tasked with stoking said crowd, surely thankful for the wearable Colonel Sanders bobblehead in spite of the heat, given that its thin fiberglass membrane was the only thing separating him from the total forfeiture of every last shred of dignity. And, finally, the anonymous producers commissioned to compose the ostensibly endorphin-goosing anthem that served as the sonic lynchpin of the whole sorry affair.That they slotted “Colonel Sanders,” a fake DJ based on a dead fried-food salesman, after a set from Matoma makes a certain amount of sense. The Norwegian DJ’s chameleonic dance pop is so flavorless, so devoid of texture, that it makes the perfect setup for a brand that puts a fancy name on a product made of “fat, blood vessels, nerve, connective tissue and ground bone” (or beaks and assholes, in the common parlance). But to sully the livestream with DJ Colonel Sanders right before a set from SOPHIE—a post-genre, transgender musician with a breathtakingly iconoclastic take on pop, whose music was the most experimental sound heard all weekend—feels frankly offensive.The stunt’s bald crassness is, in many ways, a logical extension of an industry dogged by accusations of ghost production, buying social-media followers, and other signs of general spiritual decay. It’s possible to wonder why it took so long for things to reach this point. One marvels that some enterprising sugar conglomerate hasn’t signed up Marshmello for a lucrative licensing deal peddling cutesy branded pillows of high-calorie fluff. But the move turned off fans and artists (including Marshmello), who took to social media to voice their displeasure. Despite its tongue-in-cheek spin, this pivot to sponsored content violated the one thing that was supposedly sacred: the authenticity of the talent onstage. A Vocaloid performer would have felt less artificial, less nakedly calculating, than this cartoon colonel who couldn’t even be bothered to get his drawl right.Anyone who tends to think unkind thoughts about commercial EDM may feel a pleasing jolt of schadenfreude, but even non-fans of the genre should sympathize with the festival’s attendees. Fans who paid a mint for tickets—three-day passes ran between $350 and $400, with VIP passes reaching $1500—were served advertising in place of entertainment. And if one possible justification was that KFC’s ad-buy might help fund less obviously lucrative programming choices or amenities, that defense was ripped apart by reports that Ultra’s first night ended with tens of thousands of revelers waiting hours for shuttle buses to leave the festival’s island setting—or walking nearly three miles to hitch rides home. Whatever the chicken-bucket bucks greased, it wasn’t the gears of the festival’s logistical operations.KFC’s Ultra gambit laid one truth bare, at least: Mega-festivals are, increasingly, the factory farms of the music industry. What the most craven among them offer is an unsustainable feast that’s as chemically spiced and artificially inflated as industrially produced poultry. It’s enough to turn anyone vegan.Correction:",articles4,"['Avicii’s', 'DJ Colonel', 'SOPHIE']"

"Atlanta rapper Lil Nas X is the country-trap star who never was. His viral hit, “Old Town Road,” was removed last week from ’s Hot Country Songs chart, after just one week there. But it remains on the Hot 100 chart and the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.First came ire from Nashville types—“‘Old Town Road’ is no more country than the Beastie Boys’ ‘High Plains Drifter,’” wrote Saving Country Music on March 23—before  put its boot down. “Upon further review, it was determined that ‘Old Town Road’ by Lil Nas X does not currently merit inclusion on Billboard’s country charts,”  said in a statement to . “When determining genres, a few factors are examined, but first and foremost is musical composition. While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.”The aftermath of this decision has prompted fierce debate about what is and isn’t country, bringing up longstanding questions about where black artists are allowed to exist on the charts. Black country stars like Darius Rucker, Kane Brown, and Jimmie Allen may be thriving, but the whitewashing of the genre is well documented. Just last year, Rucker and Brown became the first pair of minorities to follow each other with No. 1 country songs in the 28-year history of the Billboard Country Airplay chart.After  made its statement about “Old Town Road,” a rep for the company added that Lil Nas X’s race played no part in their decision—a fraught comment for those familiar with the charts’ history of tacit segregation. ’s R&B Songs chart, known in certains eras as Race Records or Hot Black Singles, was built on a racist industry politic: the idea that black music was made for and by black people, and white music was made for and by white people. Many black artists who don’t make R&B are still relegated to that box, while white artists have the freedom to roam freely in historically black genres. Top 40 radio has kept popular black rappers at bay, despite admitting their white counterparts. As the borders that once defined genres continue to dissolve, what are the rules and who gets to make them?Of course, Lil Nas X never expected to become a lightning rod for long-overdue conversations about chart mechanics and musicology when he channeled his inner Toby Keith. He released a goofy, fun country-trap hybrid song and marketed it as country, at the very least, to capitalize on  the current Yeehaw Agenda, but also because the song’s country overtones were obvious. The timeline of his sudden rise shows how the internet is moving music faster than the charts can map it.Lil Nas X first appeared on SoundCloud in May 2018 with a rough but functional paint-by-numbers trap demo. Two months later, he released his first mixtape, , a compilation of bass-heavy trap flexers with beats like Sonic the Hedgehog. By this point, in mid-July, there still wasn’t anything even remotely like “Old Town Road” in his catalog.In what can only be described as a left turn, Lil Nas X donned his first cowboy hat in early December when he released “Old Town Road” to YouTube, SoundCloud, and iTunes; it was the first song he tagged #country on the latter two platforms. On release day, he tweeted a video of a man in a cowboy hat, dancing at a rodeo, with his own song dubbed in and the caption, “country music is evolving.” The closest thing “Old Town Road” has to a video is a visualizer set to screen-grabs from the hit video game “Red Dead Redemption 2.” In the third-person shoot-’em-up, the player journeys across a fictionalized Old West with a gang of outlaws, trying to outrun industrialization on horseback.Following the same instincts that led him to make “Old Town Road” the unofficial “Red Dead” theme song, Lil Nas X also released in December a 55-second, Western-themed supercut clip for the song, including a scene from the  movie where Miley Cyrus embraces her country roots. A few days later, Bleacher Report was in on the joke, flipping a jockey clip from X’s supercut into a meme. The fun eventually made its way to TikTok, as most viral things do these days, and the short-form video app eventually propelled “Old Town Road” up three different charts. TikTok encourages users to add audio to its database and create shareable videos using those snippets of sound; since @nicemichael uploaded “Old Town Road” on February 23, the song has been used approximately 117,000 times across videos that have amassed over 6 million views. “I promoted the song as a meme for months until it caught on to TikTok and it became way bigger,” X told . “When TikTok hit it, almost every day since that, the streams have been up.” One meme in particular stuck with users: When Lil Nas X dips into his faux country twang for the first hook, the person in the shot transforms into the country-fied version of themselves, all spurs and square dancing.With “Old Town Road” trending online throughout the first months of 2019, the song garnered an endorsement from Brian Kelley of Florida Georgia Line, the country duo known, at times controversially, for its hybrid hits. Through a lot of meme savvy and a little radio airplay (on Radio Disney Country, of all places), Lil Nas X wound up charting higher among country songs than rap songs. (This likely can be attributed to the fact that hip-hop, now America’s most popular genre, has stiffer competition on the charts.) With streaming plays and social media guiding his way, Lil Nas X bypassed country radio’s clique-ish gatekeepers. As the song built steam (including a Justin Bieber co-sign), he signed with Columbia.As hip-hop continues to push the limits of its sound, X is far from the only rapper to experiment with country themes, but he was the one who figured out how to package them just earnestly enough for a mass audience. Click the #country tag on SoundCloud and you’ll see any number of rap songs identified that way facetiously, as a last rebellion against categorization. Artists like sad frosty and lil boom aren’t even pretending to actually make country rap. But “Old Town Road” isn’t labeled country as a gag—there are clear traces of country in its DNA. As Lil Nas X put it, “The song is country trap. It’s not one, it’s not the other. It’s both.”The Yeehaw Agenda’s hip-hop roots can be traced back to the literal “Yee Haw” that first sent tremors through SoundCloud: Young Thug’s, seconds into . Though Nappy Roots’ 2002 single “Po’ Folks” could safely be deemed rap’s first real take on country and Bubba Sparxxx attempted a crossover with 2013’s “Country Folks” featuring Colt Ford and Danny Boone, 2017’s Thug moment felt like a changeover, prompting similar conversations about what country can be. Around the same time as Thug’s rootsy “singing album” came genuine, if not exactly faithful, attempts to work country into the rap canvas, on songs like Mir Fontane’s “Down By the River,” mysticphonk’s “haunt u” with Lil Peep, and Lil Tracy and Lil Uzi Vert’s “Like a Farmer.”None of these songs have charted on the rap  country charts, however. It’s not impossible to do both, as “Old Town Road” briefly showed, but who’s able to pull it off is telling. Country-rap stalwart Colt Ford’s albums consistently appear on rap and country charts simultaneously. If his rap-heavy hit with Jason Aldean, “Drivin’ Around Song,” can be a country song, why can’t “Old Town Road”? Which “elements of today’s country music” in particular are required to pass the  smell test? It can have bars but not an 808 bass? Can only country stars flirting with rap tropes make country rap, but not the other way around? It isn’t just that the rules are unclear, it’s that they seem entirely made up—which they are. ’s chart policies are decided by humans and subject to change at any time.Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” is, at the very least, country pastiche, maybe not entirely serious in its imitation, but certainly faithful. It positions itself as country, and in so doing plays with the genre’s signifiers to such a degree that it’s registering to many as country. “For those stations that tend to be more traditional country, it might be a little left of center,” Phil Guerini, Radio Disney Network GM, told . “But you see the type of reaction the audience is having to the song. That’s informed by their perception of this song’s country relevance.” When listeners can recognize a rap song’s country bonafides, the least that gatekeepers can do is not block its crossover.",articles4,"['Lil Nas X', 'Lil Nas X', 'Darius Rucker', 'Jimmie Allen', 'Lil Nas X’s', 'Lil Nas X', 'Lil Nas X', 'Sonic the Hedgehog', 'Lil Nas X', 'Old West', 'Lil Nas X', 'X’s', 'Lil Nas X', 'America’s', 'Lil Nas X', 'X', 'DNA', 'Young Thug’s', 'Colt Ford', 'Thug’s', 'Lil Peep', 'Lil Tracy', 'Lil Uzi Vert’s', 'Colt Ford’s']"

"Listen to the track belowOn Priests’ cynical new single “Jesus’ Son,” singer Katie Alice Greer embodies a young man who is told by God that he is the son of Christ. This divine pedigree suddenly gives him license to indulge in his most apocalyptic vices. Opening with a wiry barrage of noise, the song quickly eases into sweeping guitar strokes that echo all the space the character is comfortable occupying. Without explicitly critiquing his behaviors, the Washington, D.C. trio let this egomaniac’s absurdity speak for itself. “I am Jesus’ son/I’m young and dumb and full of cum,” Greer roars on the chorus, poking fun at all the men who see themselves at the center of the universe. The video furthers this sentiment as Priests reenact the clip to Nine Inch Nails’ “March of the Pigs,” in which Trent Reznor goes full diva, tossing microphone stands and pushing his bandmates around.

"The rapper was killed following a shooting in Los Angeles earlier todayNipsey Hussle has died after being shot multiple times while outside his Marathon Clothing store in Los Angeles, as NBC News and TMZ report. NBC reports that the rapper and community activist was pronounced dead after being transported to a hospital. Two other people were hospitalized as a result of the shooting. He was 33 years old.Nipsey Hussle was born Ermias Asghedom in 1985. Raised in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles, Nipsey left his parents’ home at age 14, living with his grandmother and joining the Rollin’ 60s, a subset of the Crip gang. He began releasing music in 2005, putting out a series of mixtapes that earned him attention from other notable artists. He released a collaboration with Drake (“Killer”) in 2009 and appeared on Snoop Dogg’s  album the following year.After a brief record deal with Cinematic Music Group/Epic proved unfruitful, Nipsey founded his own label, All Music In. He would continue with a streak of mixtapes and feature appearances throughout the next decade, working with artists including YG, Rick Ross, 9th Wonder, and many more. His 2013 mixtape  made waves after he made a limited physical edition run available for $100 each.In the past decade, Nipsey made a name for himself as an entrepreneur. He opened the Marathon Clothing “smart store” and a STEM education center called Vector 90, both in the Crenshaw district. He was widely known on the west coast and reached an even wider audience after featuring on YG’s “FDT (Fuck Donald Trump)” in 2016. While Nipsey’s debut album  was announced in 2014, it wasn’t until 2018 that it was finally released. The album featured appearances by Kendrick Lamar, Diddy, The-Dream, and more, and netted the rapper a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album.",articles4,"['NBC News', 'Rollin’', 'Dogg’s', 'Rick Ross', 'The-Dream']"

That sort of consistency has won him a spot on The Untz Festival three years running.Today we have the distinct privilege of premiering “Vice,” a wonky new track from Sudweeks, who always likes to keep his cuts trippy. One thing you can always count on with a SuDs tune is that it's going to keep you guessing, and that remains true with “Vice,” which has you thinking right, then dives left.

"Story by: Michelle GarganoPhotos by: Rafael Rodriguez (InMotion Event Photography)With an industry as active and diverse as the underground electronic music scene, listeners all around the world crave the opportunity to interact with likeminded individuals and incorporate shows into their daily lives. While festival season lies dormant, the excitement and urge to experience unique shows and dance doesn’t dissipate. Lucky for us, there are the thoughtful promoters who work hard to keep this vision alive year-round and bring a little sunshine to places where the bass doesn’t always boom.Today, we are looking at a group that is focused on illuminating and diversifying mid-Atlantic music culture. Depth Perception is a production company that is working hard to bring the people of Baltimore, Maryland, and the surrounding areas, the sounds of the underground. While there is a relatively solid community for music in this vicinity, many larger event promoters cater to a different crowd. Circulating through the system under a few aliases, originally known as PeopleSources, Depth Perception was a seedling that sprouted into something extraordinary and is starting to make a ripple with its bass waves.We wanted to get the insider scoop and had the opportunity to chat with the man behind the brands, Michael Gleaner, to see what they are all about.How long has Depth Perception been around? Michael Gleaner: Depth Perception started in 2013, about two years after I started throwing shows professionally as PeopleSources. With its inception we started focusing on tighter productions and more innovative sounds and became a little more nuanced in how we book. PeopleSources has become more of a management brand consulting company with DP and its sister brand Nature of The Beats as its flagship products to boost all brands forward under the umbrella. With the success of Depth Perception it’s opened a lot of doors for us in other markets and in different types of interesting ventures.How did Depth Perception get started?MG: We started as a weekly event at a bar called Red Maple. It was a legendary spot for music throughout its 10-year run. I was the Tuesday promoter (then Thursday) for the last three years of its run. We ended strong and ultimately moved over to The 8x10 where we began to develop what most people currently known as Depth Perception.How often do you host events?MG: We do two Depth Perceptions at most per month but we are also increasing the frequency of Nature of the Beats (also hosted at 8x10 since Red Maple’s closure with a little different booking model) and we have a new free Tuesday series (potentially a weekly in the future) called Electric Avenue starting in Hamden (North tip of Baltimore) on April 23rd. It’s kind of a full circle return to where we came from and we’re super excited for that.What are your plans for the future of Depth Perception?We’re pretty set on expanding the brand outward to as many cities as possible and developing artists that have come up through the brand. We’re beginning to work with festivals more and investing in equipment and infrastructure to push outward into the cosmos.What is your favorite part about hosting events?Seeing how things unfold differently each time. I look at each event like a new experiment and a new opportunity to try something different. There are always ways to improve and when you throw events this often there’s always another opportunity to improve upon something. Most of the guys we book are talented but also super humble. It’s awesome to see.***They have teamed up with Badvss Entertainment and have a huge bill scheduled for the next few weeks showcasing some of The Untz Festival legends. Starting off with Emalkay, The Widdler & Bukez Finezt on April 11th at Ustreet Music Hall in Washington, DC, followed by Unlimited Gravity, Project Aspect and Mr Jennings on April 13th in Baltimore. To top it off, they are hosting a massive 4/20 blowout with CharlestheFirst, tiedye ky, Secret Recipe, and Image.Nation.It is so important to keep the flow and passion active in the smaller communities around the country and from the looks of it, Depth Perception is really starting to bloom. Be sure to check out one of their amazing events if you are in the area—we sure are looking forward to seeing this project continue to grow and make its way over to the West Coast.",articles15,"['Today', 'Depth Perception', 'Depth Perception', 'Depth Perception', 'The Beats', 'Depth Perception', 'Tuesday', 'Thursday', 'Depth Perception', 'Red Maple’s', 'Tuesday', 'Hamden', 'Depth', 'Emalkay', 'Mr Jennings', 'Image', 'Depth Perception']"
"By: Anand Harsh**EDIT: This track is now available as a FREE DOWNLOAD**A lot of us dubstep heads were licking our lips when we learned of the Duality Tour taking place this spring across North America.UK dubstep icon Youngsta has teamed up with rising star Khiva, and in honor of the pair's multi-date tour through April and into May, these two artists have churned out a massive tune, “Polaris” to celebrate the 'duality' of their sound.“We were able to play this out in Denver” Daniel Lockhart a.k.a. Youngsta told me, “When you make it, you never know if people are going to like it, but it went off!”Between the throwback dubstep elements, and the contemporary grit and grime of “Polaris,” I'm quite convinced of its banger status, and agree with The Black Box's assessment of this new arrow in Youngsta and Khiva's shared quiver. We had the honor of hosting Youngsta at The Untz Festival last year as part of the Pioneers of Dubstep B2B2B2B with Joker, Hatcha, and J:Kenzo, and it's apparent Mr. Lockhart is still pioneering the new sounds of dubstep.The kick off date last month in Denver was a smash.

It's going to sit on you like that extra sriracha you squirted into your noodles, and you'll be reminded of it in the morning. But, in like, a good way. Lee already joined Aguilar and our dear friend Jimmy Mosqueda, ION, for the Spicy Bois LA debut takeover recently, but the Spice train is just getting rolling.

Player Dave has slipped us his new one with LA-based Saka, and we're going to crack it open—consequences be damned.You don't have to be well-versed in Greek mythology to enjoy this collaboration of historic proportions.

The boys go straight drum and bass for the breakdown, but then bring it right back to that woozy groove that's got us on our heels.Player Dave will be heading to Mariposa, California this summer, from June 1-2 with an Early Arrival Party on May 31st for The Untz Festival, returning to its home at the Mariposa Fairgrounds.

"By: Anand HarshWhat can we say? We love us some Duffrey. And not just because he is an impeccable Chad detector (hell, he was able to detect himself), it's also because he's one of the most talented neuro, glitch-hop, and otherwise left-field bass producers we have the privilege of hosting on our channel whenever we can.To that end, the Duffman is bustin' out a new 4-track EP for Street Ritual on April 24th, and we are overjoyed to share a lil' teaser of it with you. “Bite” is typifies the Duffrey sound in that it's sonically flexible, moving all over the tempo and rhythm and dynamic range while still possessing those hallmark flavors that we love. Duffrey has the innate ability to make us giggle while we're headbanging, because his irreverent sound is just as ticklish as it is heavy.Duffrito joins his pals bioLuMiGen, Goopsteppa, spacegeishA, and more on the Wormhole stage at The Untz Festival May 31-June 2 in Mariposa, California.

After announcing the impending launch of his latest EP, Sandrock, on one of the hottest labels in underground bass music, UK's SLUG WIFE (and home of The Untz Festival acts Kursa, Seppa, and K.L.O), Reso headed to Spirit of the Suwannee Music Park in Live Oak, Florida to take on Tipper & Friends with his SLUG WIFE bretheren.After a towering set, Melia is back on the grid to push the six-track EP which serves up a ton of different sounds from the elder statesman of the SLUG WIFE crew, who has been around the bass block, so to speak, with a vibrant career in drum and bass and dubstep preceding his addition to the label roster.Reso serves up stuttering halftime with the opener, “Flexible Neck,” gutteral neuro-hop with “Gastroblapz,” CASPA-esque retro dubstep on “Gut Rot,” and almost FlyLo style dreaminess on “Loshun.”Sandrock is a quick and dirty intro to the career of Reso, that spans as many genres as his multi-faceted EP.

"By: Anand HarshThe shrouded figure known as TLZMN has emerged from his fortress of solitude to reunite with his Wakaan label.On April 19th, he unleashes 7 new tracks as part of his Sanctum EP, a roiling masterpiece of dark, haunting beats and unforgiving bass.Ahead of its release we premiere, “Blackout.” To this point, TLZMN has been associated heavily with the halftime movement, and only teased us with bouts of dnb in the midst of his tracks. But on “Blackout,” he goes full drum and bass, and we're thrilled about it.“To discover, compose and create in a world immersed in darkness,” TLZMN notes, “one must derive true intention through the darkness from powers within.”Sounds like TLZMN has gained 100% of his power from the darkness.",articles15,"['“To', 'TLZMN']"
"By: Sanjay GopalWhile LSDREAM may have successfully reimagined the Brillz brand, we had no idea he was going to recussitate the flagging midtempo bass movement. A sprawling 11-track retro-futuristic opus that's part Vangelis and part Stranger Things in its aesthetic, replete with arch 80s allusions and tongue-in-cheek sci-fi in-jokes, Wakaan fans get something well outside their normal fare while still falling under the label's catchall tag, freeform bass music.The spanking new project, conceived upon the realization of being a spiritual being having a human experience, the sound of LSDREAM is set in a futuristic soundscape where humanity has almost completely merged with the sentience of the universe.“HELLO HUMAN” with COM3T sets the pace of the album, consider it as an introductory note from the cosmic consciousness to the human race.The Leah Culver collab, “WHITE MAGIC,”apart from a catchy melodic intro, has the best hook and drop I have heard in while, and contains some memorable lyrics that may help you deal with and embrace the nature of reality and our own existence: “Abandon my disguise, when I realize... I am magical.”Highlights of the album include the infectiously slow yet dynamic “ETERNAL NOW” featuring UNTZ fave, Champagne Drip, and “PHOENIX,” the funky techno groove, sounds like the musical child of Daft Punk and Gesaffelstein. “There is no past, there is no future; only now.“ ’Nuff said! Serious The M Machine vibes. “I AM BASS,” reminiscent of Groot’s famous and only dialogue in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy/Avengers series, set to a wicked interstellar soundtrack. Also “OM NAMO;” I just love this very bold exploration of sound and devotion.Found in abundance throughout the music are cosmic arpeggiators, highly intellient bass lines that seem to have a mind of their, existential nuggets, and a sentient thread that runs through the entire tracklist which feels like it was conceived from a single source of intention. The cutting-edge production and simple yet powerful sound design makes every track on this album a feel good journey.I am in awe of the variety of moods, sounds, and expressions that are on display in this album without making it any less tight or intriguing from start to finish. The level of production chops is very high here, the focus remains on the clear message of this piece of music: “Step into the light.. you are magical!”smarturl.it/renegadesoflight",articles15,"['Vangelis', 'Wakaan', 'T', 'Daft Punk', 'Groot’s']"

"L 33 and MC Coppa are about to build on their growing body of collaborative work with a level-upping performance and studio partnership: Lights OutNamed after one of their most popular collaborations, released on Eatbrain early 2017, Lights Out hype started earlier this year with a free VIP of a version they’ve been playing at festivals for the last two years. Now the hype continues with this rowdy podcast mix and news of future Lights Out bookings and their debut collaborative EP this summer…Another solid example of drum & bass music’s long tradition of slick, super-tight DJ/MC partnerships, both artists explain how intuitive their collaborations have been so far… And how it all began at Eatbrain’s infamously riotous debut Let It Roll takeover in 2015.Lights Out, guns out. Check the mix whileYou two go back a bit, right?Coppa: Yeah man, our first collaboration was around 2015 and we’ve known each other for a while before then.That was for Black Ops wasn’t it?Coppa: That’s right, it was on my Defcon 1 EP for Subsistenz. We’d tried a few tunes before that…L 33: They didn’t quite work out but that’s the way it goes. But we’d been doing shows and having a good time for a while anyway so we knew it would work out. It’s all been very natural and was meant to be.What was the first show you did together?Coppa: We first met at Let It Roll in the Eatbrain stage. It was the outside stage, just a sea of people front to back.L 33: It was the first ever Eatbrain night at Let It Roll. People had been requesting it for a long time and it was wild man. People were out of control.What a way to form a partnership. Could you tell you’d work well together from that gig?Coppa: For me I’m able to tell if it’s going to be a good set vibe-wise from the first four or five tunes. But with Dayan it was pretty much instant. It’s not work, you know what I mean? The way he builds his sets and his selections and energy, it all fits my style.L 33: I don’t want to kiss Marvin’s ass too much, but some working relationships just flow straight away and you know you can work together. Not just live as well but we’ve been in the studio for two weeks and there’s more coming…Physically in the same space or online?L 33: Oh online, I’m in Bulgaria and he’s in Berlin but we’re online all the time while working on these things and arguing over what works.Arguing?L 33: Well not in a bad way!Coppa: I would say discussing, that’s a much better term. I actually went over to Bulgaria in January to work on some things so we did do some studio stuff in the same space. That’s when we worked out we could do something bigger than just track collaborations.Marvin I know you’re hands-on as an MC, you don’t just feature on tracks, you get stuck right in. Was that a shock for you Dayan?L 33: It was quite stressful actually! I don’t like working with him to be honest but he forces me at gun point.Shots fired!L 33: Haha. No seriously it’s great to work with an MC who gets it and we understand each other and is honest. If we think what we’ve contributed could be better, we won’t hold back.Coppa: We’re pretty much on the same page and work intuitively so the back and forth is a lot more minimal than other collaborations. We share a certain vision in that way.L 33: It’s all sounding very romantic isn’t it?Coppa: It’s a full-on bromance bro.Nice! The debut Lights Out mix captures this spirit. You bring out each other’s rowdier side.Coppa: That’s out vibe! Techy, neurofunk styles of drum & bass isn’t the easiest to MC on, it’s very busy and noisy but the way Dayan flows with the mixing creates the spaces for me to find the grooves and vibe.L 33: Same here from a DJing and production point of view. When I’m making a track or mixes with him then I can hear where he’ll fit into the groove and vibe.This is sounding pretty permanent, when will you start touring the Lights Out project together?Coppa: Obviously we’ll still be doing our solo bookings but we’ll be kicking off Lights Out in May for an Eatbrain night in Romania then Austria at Switch in Vienna. There are a few bits booked up for June and July so yeah it’s all rolling out from now.And releases, too?Coppa: We’re planning to put out a single in the summer time then an EP in the end of summertime.L 33: That will be at least four tunes and there are more to come. I think it’s like one track a week or something, the whole process of writing goes so fast.Coppa: We’ll be incorporating the productions into our sets as well with additional live elements which is really exciting to develop.L 33: Yeah we want it to be more then just a DJ/MC partnership. We want to stand out and do something different.Coppa: It’s a natural progression of what we’re doing live anyway. We’ve never had a bad or dull show in any way, that’s why we’re working together so well now.

" You know you’re onto something when Andy C starts playing your tunes.You know you’re onto something even stronger when Andy starts playing them within days of you sending them to his label manager.And you most definitely know you’re onto an absolutely mad thing if Andy uses your tune in one of his famous XOYO intros and the label signs you.Such is the case with Skantia, a 22 year old Newcastle DJ/producer who has officially joined the RAM ranks and has a persy stash of dubs to die for. The big tunes in question that Andy’s been supporting include a cheeky remix of Loko’s Bassline Secret (coming up on a special Program release later this year) and Cluster, a banger that goes a bit like this.Cluster is set to drop May 7 and will be followed by plenty more. Currently living the aspiring producer dream, to say Skantia is inspired is an understatement. We headed north for full details:Andy’s been rinsing your tunes a bit…It’s mad mate. He seems to love that Loko remix, he keeps drawing for that. It’s a mad experience to see him rinsing my tunes. It’s immense. Gutted I wasn’t able to get down to XOYO to see it in the flesh but it’s a mission down from Newcastle.What’s the scene like in Newcastle right now? I’ve never had a bad night out there!It’s great man. Jump up was huge here for years but recently everyone’s got into the deeper sounds and rollers. It’s had an impact on everything I make and play because we all want to impress each other.I think you can hear the direction you were heading in with your early stuff like Laser Defence. That rolling sound was already there even in your jump up…Yeah I think so man, it’s been a pretty natural development, I only ever make what I want to make but I know I’m inspired by what’s happening here and everyone in the scene up here.I’m trying to think of other artists I know of from Newcastle. You must know Nectax? Who else is there?Nectax is my best pal! Also Scudd & Kastro who are both killing it too. And of course man like Yun, aspiring MC and serial creema. We’re all super tight and all share and support each other. It’s really inspiring man.Crew! A combination of strength in numbers and friendly competition, right? It keeps you on your toes….One hundred and ten million percent mate! We’re all trying to out do each other. You can’t beat friendly competition. It makes it so much more fun and it’s wicked knowing you got that support. If one of us does something big then we all benefit.Love that. How did the RAM link come about?After my track Balance came out on Lifestyle, Jim the Ram label manager got in touch on Facebook and asked about an EP. I was like ‘woah!’ It gave me such a creative spurt, I started spamming him with tune after tune. I was making a tune a day. He was like ‘bloody hell, you wanna sign?’ Then the Bassline Secret remix came through and I seen videos of Andy playing it within days of finishing it. It’s mad how quickly things can happen sometimes. Same with Cluster. I sent it to Jim and he was like ‘oh my god, I need this now!’ Two days later, I get another video of Andy playing it. Mental mate.Amazing. What persy stash are you sitting on? Sounds like you’re not short of ideas!I’ve got too many tunes! Seriously. I’ve almost deaded my computer with them. It’s on its last legs but I’m getting a new set up soon and the music will flow even faster.Amazing. What other major league DJ support have you had?Quite bit fair play man. Actually Camo & Krooked hit me up the other day which was pretty mind-blowing. I sent them three tunes and I’m hoping I get some dubs back! I’ve also had support from Shy FX, Randall, Doc Scott, it’s been mental!That’s the way it works innit? Dubs are like currency in that way. You’ve got to have something to give to get something back…That’s what I think but you should see some of the requests I get. People treat dub blagging as an artform. You see it a mile off when they send you a message with a little kissy face and all that. But then when the big DJs ask you for tunes then all that goes out the window!Hahah. True! Are you resident anywhere in Newcastle then?Yeah I’m resident at a night called Dilate, it’s run by a guy called Danox. He’s helped me out so much. Everything I’ve done in drum & bass is because of him. I started selling tickets for him, then got my residency and that’s where I’ve found my sound and style. I gotta big him up massively.That’s wicked, the best artists started with flyering and ticket sales. Andy C did as it goes!That’s it man. You’ve got to put in the hard work and contribute before you can expect to reap the benefits.

Here’s how they came together and what to expect…Take us back to the start… Who came up with the idea and how quickly did it escalate?Vowel: Ru was the one who came up with the idea. He’s also the one who got things up and running and contacted everyone. He’s the frontman in all this. Most of us are based in Bristol so when Ru presented us with the idea of starting this project everything happened quite quickly and naturally.Tez (Terrence & Phillip): He really has been the driving force behind the project and has somewhat become our fearless leader. Once the idea was put forward to each individual the hype became very real as everyone involved are all equally as excited as one another. We can all see the potential we all have as a collective.Enada (KCDC): It came together quite quickly, although we definitely struggled on picking a name at first!There’s a lot of you involved. All of you coming in at similar-ish entry points as part of the new generation of acts coming into the game and all based in a similar location. So I’m guessing Rotations is an extension of the support and community you have between you anyway? Has this collective vibe been unofficially bubbling away for a while?Revan (Ill Truth): I feel like this coming together of the people involved was very natural; we’ve all gravitated towards each other outside of music so makes sense for it to join with music in mind!Ru (Revaux): In a way, yeah. Although most of us knew each other already, Rotations seemed like a great way to be able to unite in a more official capacity and create a recognisable platform for ourselves.Kyrist (KCDC): I think the majority of us have been involved in the DNB scene for a few years now, and often we find ourselves on the same line-ups for some events, or just going out and supporting each other anyway.Medic MC: Especially as most of us are Bristol based there’s a nice sense of community. Myself and Mitch (Bluejay) play out together quite a lot.Vowel: Yeah, definitely. Everyone involved in this project is supportive of each other’s work and that’s what Rotations is about.Enada (KCDC): I think so. Its great that we’ve been able to put that support network together and collaborate. It seemed obvious that we would have these particular people together in a collective.I love the collective vibe that’s popping up a lot at the moment full stop. It’s the crew mentality that the genre was largely founded on. Proper DIY too. This is all about the importance of strength in numbers right?Luke (Koherent): A little bit about strength in numbers, but to me it’s more about the strength of the scene. There’s just so many newcomers putting their own dent into the scene at the moment and Rotations is a by-product of that. Rotations to me represents a small part of a larger movement that we’re all really excited to be a part of.Enada (KCDC): I think it allows a lot of creative people to cook up some awesome ideas together. I just love the idea of all of us coming together to create something special, play the music we want to play and support each other.Tez (Terrence & Phillip): We all know that within the tight group we have the tools to reach a much further audience within the early stages of the brand than any other individual promoter trying to start out. We all feel we already hold a heavy presence within the DNB community as individuals and the thought of us all combining and working together excites us. So yes ‘strength in numbers’!Charli Brix: Collaboration over competition! There is so much to gain from working with rather than against people. Everyone works differently, you learn new things, different techniques, ways of creating – it’s good to have a solid group of people around you inspiring you to be better, learn and progress.Is there a nice friendly competitive spirit between you all with productions as well? And will there be on the nights, with everyone drawing for the latest dubs to show off to each other?Luke (Koherent): I think definitely on a subconscious level, we’re all driving each other at least! It’s also been a great way to encourage some of us to collaborate (wink wink).Charli Brix: That being said, I won’t hold back when we play together – there will of course be contest over who has the best dubs! We have a healthy amount of banter in the group and I think a little bit of competition is good.Vowel: I guess you can call it that. I think it’s more about everyone trying to push each other and help each other in terms of production. And yes, of course, everyone likes to show off their latest dubs…Kyrist (KCDC): Most probably everyone will pull out all the stops and try and outdo each other! We (KCDC) might have some special tunes to play by the time the first event rolls round.How does the night work? Will you announce which of you are playing every show or is it more along the lines of ‘come along because all our residents and collective members are sick’?Vowel: The idea is to announce who’s playing on every night and then possibly get some guests to play as well.Ru (Revaux): For the launch event in June we wanted everyone to play. Due to the insane amount of us, that will mean b2bs pretty much all night (which we are very excited about!). In terms of future events, I think we will announce who is playing every show but at the same time you should still come along because all of our residents ARE sick!Medic MC: We want to make sure that this project isn’t secretive and closed off. Emphasis will be placed on supporting emerging talent not only in Bristol but also from all around. Booking people to come and play at our nights who meet the criteria will definitely be a way of doing that. Ideally, it won’t be just residents at every night we do.The launch is a big daytime thing. Run us through it…Ru (Revaux): The launch will be on Sunday June 2 on Bristol’s Blue Mountain Terrace. Expect the scene’s best burgeoning talent, sunshine (hopefully) and an unbeatable atmosphere! This is our own project that we have built together from the ground up so we are VERY excited to show what we can bring to the people of Bristol.Vowel: Loads of dubs, loads of beers, loads of amazing artists and loads of good vibes. That’s what’s on the menu!Then what follows? Will it always be Sunday special one-offs?Enada (KCDC): No, in future we are going to be doing weekend or mid-week events, this just happened to fall on a Sunday as we wanted to have an event at Blue Mountain before it goes! But definitely expect us to be hosting a lot more events and a monthly mix series.Ru (Revaux): Yeah, to add, our mix series will feature all of us plus other up and coming DJs/artists performing guest mixes. The whole ethos of the project is to represent the next generation of talent so the mix series will give us a platform to invite other up and comers to get involved.Tez (Terrence & Phillip): Bigger club nights, bigger venues, bigger line-ups, special guests, random b2b sets. Big party vibes. Maybe more daytime events during summer and club nights during the colder months. This starts as a club night but I wonder about the bigger picture… Label, collaborations etc.Charli Brix: We’ve spoken about this and yeah for sure, we’d love to push this as far as we can. We’re looking at doing some festivals next year, a mix series in the next few months, and then who knows – maybe a label one day?Vowel: I think we’re just going to see where it goes, but our main focus now is more on the events’ side of things. Some of the artists within Rotations are already collaborating or have collaborated before in some sort of way, which is really cool.Medic MC: I think it would be wicked to do stages/showcases at festivals locally and further afield. Collaborations are also on the cards and this is the perfect opportunity to make use of all of the amazing talent on our doorstep, who knows where that can lead…Kyrist (KCDC): I think there is a bigger picture, but we’re just getting started here. I think it would be impossible for all of us to work on one track, but maybe an EP full of collabs could be a vibe!Ru (Revaux): Agreed…there certainly could be a bigger picture, but for now we are focussing on our first few movements to make sure we lay the groundwork and don’t get ahead of ourselves! Finally, a chance for everyone to big each other up. Who brings what to Rotations? Hit me with some hype for your fellow collective crewdem!!Ru (Revaux): Without gushing too much, each and every artist involved in Rotations brings something different and irreplaceable. I’m a huge fan of each of them! Everyone is achieving so much in their own right so I really can’t wait to see what we can do together.Charli Brix: It’s actually pretty cool because we all have different skill sets outside of music that we put to use in the group. For example myself, Deanna (Enada) & Ru cover our design work, Kirsty (Kyrist) has label experience, we’ve got a few guys in the group that are good with the media and visual side of things, marketing, promoting. Everyone brings something to the table.Medic MC: Personally I feel one of our strongest assets is variety. I think we are really well balanced from a vocalist/MC perspective. I love going to nights where there is a real mix of vocalists and this is a real strength that we have.Enada (KCDC): I think KCDC bring an element of fresh music mixed with live performance and vocals. Each of us are very different within our styles. I bring influences from outside of D&B, Collette brings a jazzy vibe, Charli with her soulful deep music and Kyrist with her super mixing skills and techy sound.Revan (Ill Truth): I’m just the guy manning the cloakroom, the other members are the real magic. Well, as it stands the event will be my first set under my solo project so I can’t say too much about what I bring to the table yet but expect lots of shakers….",articles39,"['Wild Bunch', 'Collette Warren', 'Terrence & Phillip', 'Vowel', 'Sinic', '…', 'Especially', 'Vowel', 'Everyone', 'Collaboration', 'Everyone', '!

"If things had gone slightly differently, this interview would have happened a year ago…Originally scheduled for a summer 2018 release, Technimatic’s third album would land, like clockwork, two years after their second album Better Perspective… Which landed precisely two years after their debut Desire Paths in 2014.But somewhere during the process Pete Technicolour and Andy Komatic went a little off-piste. Having completed the first version exactly a year ago they knew deep down they could do better… So they proceeded to scrap, edit, rewrite, rearrange and rebuild until they were happy with it. By their own account, it wasn’t easy. In fact it seems like it was the most challenging album they’ve written during their 10 years together as a duo.It sounds all the better for it, though ; Timeless Technimatic in its sense of contrast, soul, warmth and weight, the album covers everything they’ve ever thrown into their melting pot; Through The Hours ranges from naughty minimal midnight marauders like True Believer to smouldering emotional halftime chiller cuts such as Resolution by way of some of their finest straight up liquid in years such as the cascading string sweeps and dusty soul vocal of Sometimes and the current single Holding On.Both Pete and Andy personally sound all the better for it, too; they seem inspired, humbled and amazed at the reaction to the album so far, what they’ve achieved over their career so far and the busy summer they have ahead… And you get the feeling they’re savouring things much more because of the challenges their new album presented them with. Here’s where they’re at: It’s been a while…Andy: Strangely, it was exactly five years ago to this day we sent off the masters for Desire Paths.Oh wow so this has been a biggest gap between albums so far…Pete: The plan was that this album was going to be released summer last year but for various reasons that didn’t happen.Can I ask what happened?  Andy: We thought we’d finished it around last April and we go through a similar process when we finish an album and we came to the realisation that album wasn’t ready and we can do better. That’s the bottom line. As painful as it was to accept that and go back on it and pull everything apart again we feel it’s better as a result.Pete: Also Andy and I, throughout our career, have never been bothered about taking our time over things. We’ve never felt like we need to get a single out every couple of months to stay relevant. We go at our own steam in a way.I think it’s hard to battle with your ego when you have to scrap something and tell yourself you can do betterAndy: Kind of. It’s easy to say, but I would like to think that between Pete and I haven’t done that ego thing ever anyway. We’ve never considered ourselves as anything but Pete and Andy. I get your point, but I don’t think we’ve ever gone ‘That’s the best thing ever! We’ve smashed that!’ We’ve done things we’re happy with, but I take your point; it was tough to get to that position where we genuinely felt like we’d done the album but then realising ‘do you know what? We can do better and we need to do better..’A lot of that can be found in the title of the album. It’s quite a philosophical mindset. Mind you, all your albums have had a similar inspiration behind them?Pete: It was a time for reflection. Last year was 10 years since we started making music together, it’s our third album, a lot of things have happened in our personal lives that have made things more of a roller-coaster. We asked ourselves some questions; what is important to us in drum & bass? Who are we? What do we want to represent in the best light? And what you get on this album is a bit of everything of us which that title alludes to. The peaktime liquid stuff we made our name with, we tried to get some more jungly stuff and even towards the more minimal stripped back D&B, we had a dabble on that. It reflects everything about us.True Believer has all of those styles in one track!Andy: We’ve been staggered to the response to that tune. That one started more as a 3am heads-down vibe, which it still has, but it totally took its own direction and had a life of its own.Pete: That’s a classic example of a track that writes itself. Most of the tracks on the album date back at least a year or even more of edits, arrangements changing, different mixes. But that was the last track we wrote… And we did it in a day. Some of that energy of that feeling when it all just comes together quickly is encapsulated in the track.Nice. So those questions you asked yourselves… Did you get any answers?Pete: I don’t think we came up with anything definitively. But we have been humbled by the fact that we’ve been doing this for 10 years and we’ve managed to take it this far. We could have never dreamed it go like this. To me it still feels as magical now as it did back then. It feels as much as a surprise as it did back then. People buy our music, DJs play our music, we get booked to play festivals. That’s an amazing feeling.I think that’s wicked. It’s easy to lose that buzz.Andy: It just spins us out. We were getting excited the other day about some bookings we have in the summer and we’ll be travelling together. Different countries and different sizes of shows. It’s exciting. Hearing our music on Radio 1 has never lost its buzz and spins us out. At times making the album had its ups and downs but the beauty of that is that it’s made us remember why we do this and how much we love it. It’s quite overwhelming.Pete: On the flip side of that, it has to be said, we had some dark times on this album in ways that we haven’t had with previous albums. There was a point when we were in the studio and said ‘shall we just sack this all off?’Andy: Yeah like what’s the fucking point?WowPete: Yeah, it hasn’t been easy all the time. But that’s made us appreciate things so much more. The launch party was just another level and we’ve seen the vinyl, which always give you that feeling of completion because you’re holding it there in your hands.My bait sensors are tingling here when you say it got dark. Can I use a headline like ‘WE ALMOST QUIT!’ here? Were you at one minute to midnight?Andy: Ha! No that’s not the headline. This was around the time last year where we questioned the album. We go through a process at the end of the album where we’re in the studio working on the final detail of everything and we got to the end of that, listened to it all back through and just felt broken. It had been very intense process in a room with no daylight and we knew we had to do better but we just felt, only for a moment, that we were just spent. Like get us the fuck out of here.Pete: There was one tune that almost killed us. It was after we decided to fuck it off and bury it we felt we could move on.Will you ever go back to it? Too soon?Andy: Ahhhh….Pete: Never say never… But not right now.Andy: It has got a great vocal on it.Pete: It has. But it’s all too raw still. I can’t even bring myself to hear the opening notes.Andy: I can’t even say its name.I’m glad the album sounds like you guys. You haven’t jumped on the jump-up bandwagon. Lots has happened in drum & bass since Better Perspective, but you’ve not been swayed by that.Andy: That’s nice to hear. When you’re in the writing process and making it you still don’t know if the album is good, or if people are going to like it, or if you’ve strayed too far from your sound.No jump up though…Pete: We did actually have a little play with something.Andy: We did. And that ended up on the cutting room floor too!Like Better Perspective and Desire Paths it’s a proper album. It tells a story, there’s that consistency throughout. It’s a traditional album.Andy: I think from pretty early on working together we realised albums would be the best place for us to flourish and find our sound. We’ve never been ones to fling out 12”s. We like the storytelling and we like that freedom an album gives you. We’re fully aware that few people, beside super fans and die-hard followers, are going to listen to the whole thing. Most will cherry pick their favourites. But that’s life. The bottom line is that we made something we’re proud of ourselves and can enjoy from start to finish.Which track can you sit back and enjoy the most? Both answer at the same time….Andy: Sometimes Pete: Goodbye KissOooh… Pete you go firstPete: Goodbye Kiss was made not long after we finished Better Perspective. It’s gone through lots of changes along the way but it’s been in its finished state for the last few years. I’ve played it in every set, Andy has too. I’m not sick of it yet and I love it even though, to us, it’s really old now. It’s classic Technimatic. It’s what we’re about encapsulated in five minutes with a fantastic vocal by Millie Jackson.Brilliant. That’s a rare one.Pete: We’ve re-played everything else on the album and it always takes a long time, but we just couldn’t replace Millie. That’s been really satisfying.How about you with Sometimes Andy?Andy: I remember when we were sketching the original vibe for that tune it was Pete who’d come up with those beats. That were different and nodded back to older jungle days. It had this crazy blend of synthesised sounds with the old school drums. It felt familiar but at the same time felt like nothing else. It captures the big soul vocal and our roots. I also love I was in my house on a Friday night, having a glass of wine just listening to the radio and on it came. Annie Mac was playing it. I got quite emotional. To hear that on national radio and know it’s being played out in people’s cars, homes… It spins you out. She’s played it over and over again on all kinds of shows. That’s a great feeling; like ‘bloody hell! All those moments we questioned ourselves during the process and there’s our tune on the radio.’ It’s mad and genuinely humbling.The launch party seemed to have the same effect for you too…Andy: To sell out the venue is one thing, but the vibe was right off the hook straight away. The crowd makes the party. You can have the best line up ever and the room just isn’t working. But other nights it works like a perfect storm of all the important ingredients. All these amazing artists, the audience were up for it, all our friends there. The smiles and noise and vibes. It was amazing and it made everything worthwhile. When you’re in the thick of it and you’re trying to make it work and it’s tough and intense and it feels like the centre of the universe and it’s emotionally, physically and mentally exhausting but then you have a vibe like that and it makes all of it worthwhile.Perfect. So… Will we be speaking again about album four in two years time?Pete: Too soon! We just need to sit back and enjoy it. Even the thought of making another tune is daunting right now but never say never…Technimatic – Through The Hours is out now on Shogun AudioFollow Technimatic: Facebook / Soundcloud / Twitter",articles39,"['Technimatic’s', '… So', 'Technimatic', 'True Believer', 'Resolution', 'Andy: We', '…', 'Lots', 'Sometimes Andy?Andy', 'Annie Mac', 'That’s']"
"Nymfo will release his second album, Pictures On Silence, on May 10.12 tracks deep with only three collaborations (Arkaik, Sense MC and Fuj), the album explores the darker, rolling sound he first made a name for himself in the late 2000s as he peppered the game on every label worth throwing a shoe at; Metalheadz to Spearhead, Innerground to Inneractive via Critical, 31, CIA, Commercial Suicide, Horizons and of course Ant TC1’s Dispatch, the label where the Amsterdam artist is most commonly spotted and will be releasing Pictures On Silence.The album lands seven years after his debut Characters and follows a rich vein of recent releases such as the hefty Black Sun Empire collaboration EP Mud, tracks on Dabs’ album and MC Fava’s EP and his still-killer Twisted Funk EP last year. It’s also his most personal body of work to date.Using his late father’s painting as inspiration for the artwork and naming the evocative finale track after him, the album sees the name born Bardo Camp paying tribute in a heartfelt way. Mr Camp senior isn’t the only inspirational force at play; Pictures On Silence also sees Nymfo return to a sound and a mindset that drove him the first place, but has proved a challenge to find in recent years. Until now.Feeling happier about his work and the sound and spirit of the genre in general than he has in years, Pictures On Silence captures a man at the start of a new chapter. Here’s how it came to be…It’s been a while since Characters. Seven years…Yeah 2012. It took a long long time. Since that album my life has changed in many ways.  I became a dad, twice, and have two amazing daughters. So that’s intense and life changing. My dad passed away too, which had a major impact. And on top of that, I wasn’t quite so happy with what I was doing and what drum & bass was doing.For me it felt like things were either very neuro or very liquid. There wasn’t as much space for the sound I really love, so I wasn’t quite as confident about my output or where it belonged. Now things have changed. It feels like, thanks to guys like Skeptical and Alix Perez, that people are digging a little deeper again. It’s a perfect time for the sound of drum & bass I love.I hear you there. But there’s always been wicked tunes in all styles. Your varied output has been an example of that in itself…For sure man, I love a lot of styles and have made a lot of styles. But I missed the vibe for a while. There was always good drum & bass but now seems to be a better time for the sound I love to make. I don’t think an album like this would have found a home so easily a few years ago. Or perhaps, if I’m honest, I should say I didn’t want to take the risk of spending that amount of time on an album when I didn’t know if it would really fit within in the context of what else was happening.When did you start thinking it would?Around the Twisted Funk EP, maybe late 2017/ early 2018. I’ve done a lot for Ant on Dispatch anyway, but when I wrote that EP for him I got inspired. I wrote so many sketches and ideas and the EP came together in two weeks. It was so quick and natural. Shortly after I came up with five other ideas and called Ant and we discussed an album. I was straight in the studio. That was March last year, I went to the studio for a few months and wrote about 20/25 ideas and we refined it from there.That’s quick!Yeah it was about waiting for the right time. It took me years to get to that position but when I was ready it just flew out. Had I made that decision a few years ago then the process would have taken a lot longer. I was feeling the vibe again. Feeling it more than I had for a while. I was inspired by the music being released as well. Every week more amazing new music, more competition for the style I like. And a lot of it from exciting new talented guys. That’s inspiring man.Who in particular? For some reason Monty sprang to my mind straight away…Oh Monty for sure. He’s amazing. I know I’m going to miss people out but M-Zine, Scepticz, Phentix… Just three names of many I could list. All these guys I’ve known for a long time and watched them rise up their game. They’re really hitting the spot with their own sound and amazing production skills. It’s great seeing that develop.Nice. Let’s talk about the title… There’s got to be a story behind Pictures On Silence?It’s a deep one man. So five years ago my dad passed away. He had cancer and in his last year he took up painting. He’d never painted in his whole life but he started and he was quite talented. The first, and one of his last, was super arty and amazing and I used it as inspiration for the artwork. Look at the original and the artwork. Wow this is a proper personal piece of workIt’s very personal. Dad’s story behind the painting is that it starts bright then goes dark. He wanted to paint his life. Happy times, dark times, those are the pictures. And I wrote lots of music with those pictures and memories in my mind. In the middle he put a dark black line, that’s the disease. That’s the cancer, the silence. None of us knew he had that type of creative articulation or expression. It touched me. So a really close friend who did the artwork took the painting as main inspiration and made this amazing artwork for it. Even if u don’t like the music, buy the vinyl for the sleeve.What a nice way to pay tribute to himThanks. The last track, A.F.C, is my dad’s initials. It’s a special track for him. When he was sick I told him I would do a tribute to him. I knew I would use his painting and make sure he’s remembered and included in my own creative art.No word of a lie, A.F.C is my favourite track of the album. Goosebump overload.Andreas Franciscus Camp. That’s him. To make it even more personal, I was there when he died. His last breaths. That’s the end of the track, you hear a lot of overdirve and distortion that builds up and there’s that ‘ahh’ at the end. That’s the last breath. That’s the end of the album.Fuck! That brings a whole new layer to an already powerful tune!It does manDid your dad approve of your life in drum & bass?One hundred percent! He was the guy who gave me that push I needed. I was 23 years old, I was DJing already since 15 and was getting serious about it and really wanted to make it happen. I had the opportunity to do a tour in Australia and New Zealand but was working full time at the time. My boss said going away for a month was not an option. I had to work. My dad was the guy who said ‘quit your job. Do it. If you don’t do it you’ll always regret it, whether you make it a success or not.’ I did and I’ve never had another normal job since. That was down to dad. Usually your parents are the ones who are like ‘no, get a proper job, be sensible,’ they don’t want you to take risks but dad was like ‘do it, see how it goes…’ Biggup for him, I’ve been on a roll ever since.Love that! I’d say you’ve been on more of a roll than you have in years lately… There was the track on Dabs album, the collab with BSE, a track on Fava’s EP. You’ve been busy!Thanks man, it’s all coming together. It’s not like I didn’t do anything in the last few years but maybe I was trying to look for inspiration or new ideas in different places, maybe misguided places? But lately there’s been loads of things happening, the timing feels right, cool collaborations, cool opportunities, cool people inspiring me with their music. I’ve been releasing for 12 years and sometimes you feel the vibe more than others.Cycles, isn’t it?Yeah but also life experiences, different perspectives. I’m not 21 anymore; I have a different life and want something else from it now. And I’m super happy with how things have been in the last year or so. With an album on top of that, it’s a very nice place to be. I’m happy.Awesome. How about the future, what happens after the album?There’ll be a remix EP for sure. And because I’m still in the production mode I sent another four tracks to Ant and he loved them all and has played some of them at Fabric. So I’ve no doubt there’ll be another EP, maybe a few collaborations. Oh and a launch party in Fabric on June 14 with a Dispatch Room 1 takeover.

"Fresh off the back of their UK wide Outline tour, and their UKF10 track with Koven In Your Arms, Hybrid Minds have now confirmed they’ll be hosting a four week takeover at South London’s Phonox.The Outline residency will run every Friday throughout June, will include special yet-to-be-announced guests and see the duo going back to their DJ roots as they return to one of their most cherished venues; back when Phonox was Plan B, Matt and Josh cut their teeth and earned their DJ stripes at Spearhead events years ago. Now they’re ready to put their own soulful signature stamp on the venue. And it all kicks off with a brand new single the week they launch the residency.Roll on June…Loving the residency vibes at the minute. Having the consistency and building a regular crowd over the four weeks must be an exciting prospect? It’s super exciting for us we are always looking to try out different avenues to keep momentum going. It’s going to be a lot of fun. The thought of having regular faces that come to more than one show is great.Were you residents at any nights during your rises up the ranks? No, we haven’t done them before. It’s pretty daunting but we will dig deep and make-sure we keep each set fresh and interesting.You played at Phonox regularly for Spearhead parties when it was back as Plan B, right?This is the main reason we are so excited for it. Those shows were some of our favourite events ever. That club was the perfect size and layout, you really felt like you were part of the crowd and amongst it all. There’s nothing more enjoyable than that. There was literally no detachment from the DJ and the ravers.You can’t mention the guests yet but please conjure up some hype and mystique…We have decided to keep it all liquid for the residency and have hand-picked DJs who we believe complement our own style.How about vocalists? They played a strong role in the Outlines tour…For the residency we have decided to really focus on the DJ sets. We have just got off the back of a full vocal set tour and think it’s time to come back to a proper underground club setting where we can draw for a wider selection of music. That said, you can expect a tickle of vocal action at a couple of them.I think there’s a release coming around the same time as the residency? Can you reveal this? We are just finalising it all, but we will be dropping our next single a week ahead of the first show. This one is a collaboration with one of our favourite vocalists in drum and bass that we have never used before.Hear it first at Phonox.

"This Saturday, April 13, sees the Clashmouth Drum & Bass Market return to House Of Vans, London.Now in their third consecutive year, it’s another rare opportunity to catch such a vast cross section of labels, artists and fans together in one real life place where you can support our scene where it counts and get ahead of the queue for exclusive releases, limited edition vinyl, new merch lines and plenty more.  Cutting out the online middle men, Clashmouth guarantees your money goes directly to the people who work tirelessly to keep the genre alive and evolving. Live sets, panels and workshops will be also held throughout the day while 26 of the finest and most authoritative labels in D&B history – ranging from Hospital to Reinforced by way of RAM, Inperspective, Dread, Critical, Rua Sounds and beyond – will be representing and packing serious specials. Most of the stalls will be run by the label founders and artists themselves, meaning a fair few bonafide legends will be in the building. Clashmouth takes place from 1pm-6pm this Saturday. In the meantime we spoke to another legend, one of the Clashmouth founders Chris Inperspective to hear how this unique seasonal event came to be, what benefits such an event has and how the event is also raising money for Music Minds Matter. Get to know…Introduce us to Clashmouth – What is Clashmouth and why did it begin?About four years ago, myself and many other people who ran events at the time, would all have these events placed on the same night. This problem would often happen, causing all of the events to clash. It just made me think, how if we just all sat down and started speaking to each other, then we would be able to either have events on in different nights, or even collaborate. This was how Clashmouth originally was born.After a while, the idea adapted and grew. We started seeing how label markets were selling vinyl (and a bunch of other things) for labels, but mainly focused on house and techno. There was a realisation that there was nothing like this for drum and bass. So it sparked our interest in doing drum and bass markets.What is the aim for Clashmouth?We want these markets to help out labels, often those that are completely underground. Not every label is in the spotlight, and Clashmouth is a way that all labels and all drum and bass fans can come together and can find new labels. With finding these new labels, they can also support the brands and discover more music. On occasion it was noted, that some can earn three months worth of online sale in a day! The revenue generated  via the market, will help them grow and that’s what we’ll like to see. We want to help all jungle and drum & bass. How have past events gone, is the aim becoming a reality?We had our first events back in 2017 at Cafe 1001, which went well. At the time we’d only have a handful of labels attending. We then grew in size, having a larger crowd attending the markets and more labels becoming involved. Which was great! We pulled in more workers, and also changed location. Our most recent home for the market is at the House of Vans. Which we’ve hosted three previous markets there, with often one in April and one in October. The spring and winter drum and bass markets. Now we have over 50 labels connected to Clashmouth, with more labels wanting to work with us, although we don’t have enough room at the moment for all to have stalls. We’ve also had to increase the amount of people working behind Clashmouth, to be able to balance everything and to make sure everything is taken care of properly. So we have between 5 and 10 people now who help run Clashmouth.What can we expect on Saturday>So on Saturday we host our first market of the year at the House of Vans. In the Cinema Room we have Education & Bass taking over to provide production and feedback workshops. So bring your music. And of course the market stalls within the main area including 26 labels from the biggest within the scene to the underground. It’s a great way to discover new labels and music.Could you tell us some of the labels in attendance?You have loads! You have Hospital Records and Med School which have been to our previous markets. You have Viper Recordings which is there first time attending the market. You have Critical Music, RAM Records and many others. As well as underground labels such as Inperspective Records, Diffrent Music Nomine Sound, Trouble on Vinyl and a host of great brands, You’ll have to check the flyer for them all.How about the talks?So as I’ve previously said, you have Education & Bass in the Cinema Room. But, we have AIM providing talks on licensing and sync, which will be great for labels  wanting to generate alternative revenue streams. There will also be an MC panel, which will be hosted by Goldenchild MC. That will have guests such as Visionobi, MC Fokuz, Miss Trouble, Sense MC and many others.Are there any artists which will be confirmed to attend this event?There aren’t  any artists confirmed to attend, but artists will definitely turn up. At previous events of ours we’ve had Pola & Bryson, Fracture, GLXY and others. We’ve even had Marc Mac turn up at one of our events, which was intimidating to everyone! Having a legend in the scene walk around you, definitely gives you a weird feeling. We’re not worthy!This event, just like previous, is linked up with Music Minds Matter charity. What made Clashmouth select that charity, and how can people get involved?When it comes to Clashmouth, we aren’t looking to make money from it, in fact we’re pretty transparent with our earnings. We wanted a way to generate money from the drum and bass scene to help others. Music Minds Matters was first introduced to us, when we sadly lost Apex – also known for being one half of Unknown Error, due to suicide. Since then we’ve supported Music Minds Matter, with raising money for the charity via raffle tickets and online JustGiving campaigns.Get involved: Clashmouth takes place April 13, House Of Vans, London.

"The right honourable A.M.C will be returning to govern the halls of London rave institution Fabric this Friday with his second Energy event.A concept that digs deep across the decades and flavours, Energy is A.M.C’s salute to the entire genre, its melting pot culture and rich tradition of dubplates. No pigeonholes, no boundaries and a serious three hour session with the Titan bossman, he promises just as many cult classics as he does upfront dubplates.He also promises an album of the same name: after a year of denting the dance with kindred strongarm spirit Turno, A.M.C’s debut album Energy will drop in September. It follows a series of single releases that’s already in full flow. So far we’ve had the ludicrous Mind The Gap and, as of last week, the equally high voltage Look Out.There’s more to come. But for now all roads lead to Fabric this Friday where he’ll be taking over room two with a roustabout rollcall: S9, DBR UK, Upgrade b2b T>I, Ed Rush, MCs Eksman, IC3, Phantom, 2Shy and Fokus plus a very special mystery guest. This is what you can expect from the Energy show and the album.Energy! It’s out in September, but I guess it all started with the first Energy show…Yeah it did. I came up with the idea of the album about a year ago but I wanted to announce it in case anyone nicks the name! So I wasn’t planning to do any of them until this year, but last year my agent Fran at Primary got me an opportunity to test the water at Fabric, they were opening up room three again so we tried a little tester to see if it works.Who was on the line up?Frankee, Mollie and TC who I asked to play an hour of his own music with his Total Carnage concept. Low Down Deep were in room one as well and when we turned up the queue was down the road, across the road and down the other one. I haven’t seen that in London for a while! It was inspiring to see. Not just because it was my first Energy night, but as a fan of the music who grew up in this city and fell in love with it. Seeing queues like that makes me happy.Absolutely! So that’s where it all began and it exceeded expectations…Massively. I was still worried because it’s far away from the album release and need to maintain that momentum. But they’ve become their own thing. I do a three-hour set, which I don’t do anywhere else. The great thing is, when we did the first, is that people could see on social media I was digging deep into the classics, converting records you can’t get digitally, so it attracted a huge mix of people; heads who I hadn’t seen in years who wanted to clothesline me when I dropped the older tunes and younger heads who are just getting into this appreciating who the older and new stuff relates, I guess. It’s amazing though, three hours gives me an opportunity to cross the board, in terms of subgenre and years. It’s not your average club night. The same goes for this one coming up; we’ve got Ed Rush, Upgrade & T>I, DBR UK…Who’s your secret special guest for this next one?Haha I can’t tell you that mate. You know that!Blatantly TurnoI can tell you it’s definitely not him but trust me, no one will be disappointed. I have to pinch myself that it’s happening. I’m so buzzing about it. Anyway I missed out a name from the line-up, S9 who is coming through and crazy talented. I’m gutted I can’t release any of their music this year because I’m being selfish and the release schedule is dedicated to the Energy release.Time to focus on your own music for a bit?There’s only so much time and space you give the music and if I release my music and theirs then it compromises all releases. At the start of the year I said to the guys on the label if they wanted to release on other labels I’d try and help them link it up and make those connections for them. I don’t want them sitting there for a year getting frustrated.Props. You get the feeling not all labels would do that?It’s one of things I knew when I was setting Titan up; I’d never sign anyone exclusively. I’ve seen so many people getting shelved. Super talented people who end up getting jaded and leaving music altogether. Not everyone, obviously. But you do see some horror stories and I didn’t want to be responsible for that with anyone I work with. I try and help wherever I can.Nice. Back to you, though… We’ve had Mind The Gap. Now Look Out. Guess you’re rolling things out gradually in the build up to the album?Yeah man, a track a month now in April, May, June, take a little release break in the summer and then drop the album in September. But I have to be honest, none of these tracks are actually finished. The only ones are the ones you mention; Mind The Gap and Look Out. Nothing else is near completion.What!It sounds crazy but I’ve got it all planned out. So the album is coming in five sampler single tracks then, when the album comes out, there are five extra tunes. 10 tracks in total. So the first five are Mind The Gap, Look Out, a tune with Phantom which hasn’t got a name but is pretty much done, there are two more which are beyond WIPs, the ideas are solid, they just need finishing.What about the other five?There’s Energy itself which is what the entire album is based around. I did it a year and a half ago and love it. But I’ve only ever played it out three times; I road-tested it in Flex Vienna when I made it, I played it at Let It Roll and then the last Energy show. It’s my favourite production and a killer intro track but I’ve purposefully held back on it until it’s closer to the album. Then the rest of the tunes on the album include one called Throwback, which is three or four older track styles all smashed into one. It’s got Hardware vibes, Virus vibes, Universal Project kinda vibes. Then switches into a jungle thing.Oh goshYeah, it’s pretty much a CV of my roots. I love it. As for the rest of the album there’s a mixture of more jump up things and techy things… And some heavy jungle influenced track I’ve just written. I admit it’s a unique way of writing an album; doing the tune one by one… After I’ve announced the thing.Yeah usually it’s done ahead of any announcement and kinda sits there for a while before it drops…Exactly man. I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to have some sense of immediacy. It’s called Energy, so it needs to be delivered in that way too; a constant flow of tracks that reflect where I’m at and where we’re at with this music. There’s no other story besides that.I like the honesty of that. And there is a story; this is you. You’ve mentioned your influences and your passions… it captures you and this moment in time. That suits you and your personality.I guess it does. And because I’m splitting it up I can give each track a focus and do my best to make sure tracks don’t get overlooked or slept on. You see it a lot with artists who drop a significant album and a few months later everyone’s like ‘where’s the new music?’ I don’t want to do that.Especially as this is your first solo stuff for a bit, right?That’s true. I did a few remixes but no, everything was with Turno last year. So this year I’m concentrating on my personal music.I thought you and Turno were going to form a solid act for a bit you know…I think we’re both too inspired by our own things to ever be a collaboration full- time but we’ve got stacks of music waiting. At least six or seven tunes which are sounding wicked. We’ve got remixes like our one of Where’s My Money? So we’ve got all this ammo and not going to fire it out until at least next year. Strictly dubs mate.That’s exactly what you promised when we did that interview when you launched the concept…Exactly. And if we come back then it’s going to come back with a bang. In the meantime I’m working on my album, Frank’s on tour and doing some sick collabs. It’s funny; we borrow each other’s ears a lot and give each other very honest feedback but we can’t actually play these things in our own sets. Everything he sends me is weaponry for his set and I have to respect that.That’s your currency innitIt is. And I think more artists should do this; make their own specials and versions and VIPs. Things people can’t hear anywhere else. That’s what you get booked for. Not just unreleased new tracks but twists on tracks that people know and will surprise them. It’s great to see more of this; there’s an interest from fans for new things, they want to be surprised.It’s a great time for the music full stop, I thinkYeah definitely. It’s like fashion; things go round in circles and cycles don’t they? Like with production; for years everyone was very much ‘in the box’ but now there’s a thirst for outboard kit. There’s no coincidence that the “rolling” sound has come back at the same time. And from there what’s the most logical step in the cycle? Jungle. I love it. Literally before you called me, geez, I was about to record a lot of my old Juice Recordings vinyls, loads of old VIPs and remixes that never came out. I’ve been tracking down tracks and calling up people and asking them about tracks. Like Ed Rush and Optical’s Bleep Bleep. They’re like ‘fucking hell mate, that’s a blast from the past.’ I’ve been calling guys and bringing back memories of tunes they hadn’t thought about for years. Friction too. We’ve been geeking out about dubplates for hours. And that’s where Energy comes back into it; I’m playing these tunes in my Energy sets and properly taking things back in time and joining the dots and making sure the whole spectrum is celebrated.

"Ever since he emerged from the ashes of seminal dubstep duo 16 Bit as a solo artist in 2014, Moody Good has never been a particularly prolific artist.As a result of this consistent no-spam manifesto, his less-is-more social media presence and his reputation for working behind the scenes on myriad next level projects (which ranges from producing Bjork’s last album to sound design on movies such as Transformers Ages Of Extinction), everything he’s ever dropped has been worth paying attention to…. Right from his eponymous debut album through to his sense melting sucker punch mix series Music To Go Fuck Yourself To and, most recently, last month’s Goofball EP on Never Say Die.His first proper EP release as Moody Good since This Is The Investigation on OWSLA in 2015, and his first release full stop since his remix of Noisia’s Get Deaded two years ago in April, Goofball is four tracks of pure bass grit, twisted and fractured in Eddie Jeffries’ inimitable and highly noxious way. He promises us we won’t have to wait another four years for his next EP. In fact we won’t have to wait that long at all. Currently more inspired than he’s been in years, this is where Moody Good is at right now and why we should be excited about it…You’re back! Where have you been?I’ve been a deadbeat dad! A full time stay at home daddy and loved every minute of it.Nice!! Congratulations man!Thanks. I made a conscious decision to take a break, focus on what’s important and refresh a bit. Now I’m the most inspired I’ve been in such a long time. I’m completely back on the music and really enjoying it. I’ve been working on other things that aren’t as Moody Good which have been incredible too. I wish I could talk about them but they’re not quite ready to announce yet. These projects will be revealed down the line and I’m really excited about them.Awesome. That’s what I wondered… We might not have heard much from Moody Good but I know you’re involved in all kinds of other projects!Yeah I kept myself so busy the Moody Good thing had to be put aside for a little while. But I never let it completely die. I’d do the occasional thing to keep it active and make sure people knew I was still doing things. I did six shows last year to keep it fresh . But now 2019 is the year. I’m inspired by the other things I’ve been doing so I started writing, I turned the taps on and they’re flooding now. It’s like ‘shit! Let’s get this out immediately!’ There’s more to come.Nice to have that balance. I bet those six shows were special. For you and the audience…Really special. It’s a very mad feeling when people still turn up even though I hadn’t been releasing anything or posting shit every day. It is special for me that those people chose to support my shows. I’ve been blown away that people still give a fuck and are interested. It’s nice to return and not have to start again from scratch. No one seems to be like ‘who the fuck are you?’But you made such a strong impression from the start. Besides young fans who haven’t yet delved into the history a bit, you’re pretty hard to forget. Plus there’s been the Music To Go Fuck Yourself To mixes.Yeah I enjoyed making them and the whole mixtape vibe. There were quite a lot of ideas there but I didn’t want to make intros just for the sake of it. I wanted it to be just like a kinda high impact mini mix. We used to do them as 16 Bit; just a full blast of new tunes in short sharp punch.Not everything needs to be made for other DJs to play!I did end up making DJ versions with little intros and outros but yeah this was more for banging on your headphones, in your car, at home, whatever. Not everything needs to be made with the club in mind.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Was that because you weren’t playing in clubs so much so you weren’t club-focused yourself?Interesting. I’ve not thought of that and it wasn’t a conscious decision to do that but yeah maybe. It felt right to make those mixes in that way.Has becoming a dad influenced you musically in anyway?Not musically, in terms of how I sound, I’m still making some pretty heavy stuff. That was a worry actually, that it would make me go all soft but no. But it’s changed how I work in terms of efficiency. I can’t sit around procrastinating at all now, I have a certain amount of hours to get something done and I’ll sit down and make sure it’s fucking done. That’s changed hugely but musically it’s still the same old Moody Good sound.You can hear that on the Goofball EP… Were they made when you got back into writing or ideas from before?A few were made at the end of 2017 but weren’t complete, then over the year I’d jump on them whenever I could to finish them. Sixty Sixty was pretty much done by end of 2017 though so I finished a bunch of tunes around it. There’s a whole batch of things ready to start to come out;  more singles, more collabs. I’m much more focused now and have sicked out my laptop so I don’t have to be tied to the studio, I can get ideas down anywhere if they come to me. That’s been incredibly liberating.You mentioned collabs. Hydraulix mentioned you in an interview earlier this year. It’s cool that even if you haven’t seemed active, you’re still following the music and in touch with it. Or were there points where you totally dropped out?For about three months around my daughter being born I couldn’t give a shit about music but all the time I’ve been watching, listening and following, lurking in the background. A lot of people who make the music are friends of mine so we’ve kept in touch and with Hydraulix I actually got in touch with him to tell him how sick his Headbang tune is. We started sending ideas back and forth and that’s been working very well. We’ve got a few collaborations coming, which is sick. But yeah goin back to the question, just because I’m not posting about it, I’m still loving it, still into it…I like it. There’s an air of mystery then. No one needs to know what Moody Good had for breakfast.Ha. It works for some DJs, it doesn’t for others. I’m just like that. I do have a troll Twitter account that no one knows about though.That adds to the mystery even more! So what’s coming next?There’s a lot of stuff coming. I can’t mention the labels it will come on and I don’t want to namedrop too many other collabs, but I can tell you I’m working on a collaboration with Bassnectar which is sounding really cool.You seem very inspired and excited man…I fucking am mate. It’s great and nice to be back, taking a break was the right thing to do and now I’m back I’m like ‘wow I’ve missed this.’ There’s more music, more shows, there’s a drone album which I’ve almost finished, just loads and loads of stuff. Hopefully I can reveal more very soon…Moody Good – Goofball EP is out now on Never Say DieFollow Moody Good: Facebook / Soundcloud   ",articles39,"['Bjork’s', 'I’m', '! Let', 'I’m', 'I’m', '!

"We’re genuinely not sure if this is an April fool or not…This morning the community page Drum & Bass Baltics announced a new Russian drum & bass ‘supergroup’ the Russian Jump Up Mafia. The post included link to a Soundcloud page with four full on, noxious, overtly pumped hybrids that sit somewhere between jump up, dancefloor and the Russian hard dance phenomenon hardbass.After a bit of digging we’ve been told that the group are anonymous but are apparently all well known Russian drum & bass producers. The lead track Anthem features Russian Village Boys (arguably the most famous tracksuit wearing squatting Slavs in the world right now) and it’s without doubt the most Gopnik drum & bass and we’ve ever heard… Or seen.As mentioned, we have no idea if this is an April fool joke. But to produce a video, set up socials and make an EP’s worth of tracks and collaborate with an act who have been unavoidable across mainland Europe and have recently had a major Adidas endorsed hit with Dutch/Polish rapper Mr Polska? It all seems a little elaborate and over the top for just one day of jokes.One thing is certain; the music most definitely is…We recently spoke to Neuropunk founder and Gydra member Bes about the golden age of Russian drum & bass and discussed how the new movement of artists and the new Neuropunk label suggests there’s a new rise in talent emerging from Russian speaking and Ex Soviet states. Could the Russian Jump Up Mafia be another new catalyst for this new movement? If so, it’s certainly a new direction from the more neuro characterised sound that has traditionally emerged from Russia… And one that most D&B purists will find very hard to accept.You can follow them and see how this develops. We’ll keep you posted if/when we find out more.",articles39,"['Village Boys', 'Mr Polska', 'Gydra', 'Neuropunk', 'We’ll']"

Little Dragon, George Clinton, Thundercat and Toro Y Moi are amongst those who make appearances. Graffiti-based teasers started promoting new work from Flying Lotus back in March during the SXSW festival, around six months after he confirmed a new album was being mastered. Cult film director and experimental musician David Lynch also features on one of the record's 27 tracks, providing spoken words for 'Fire Is Coming', which boasts a video directed by Flying Lotus and David Firth, the latter perhaps best-known for creating the animation 'Salad Fingers'. “I’d been working on stuff for the past five years, but it was always all over the place. I’d always had this thematic idea in mind— a lingering concept about fire, an eternal flame sitting on a hill,” a statement from Flying Lotus reads. “Some people love it, some people hate it. Some people would go on dates there and some people would burn love letters in the fire. Then I went to this party and heard David Lynch saying the words that he wound up saying on the record. And I was like, ‘that’s it, we’re just going to go in that direction.”Check out the video for 'Fire Is Coming' below.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

The changes include a comprehensive site redesign, a single and unified music player, and the commitment to open sourcing its codebase.

Naturally, attention has now shifted to what will happen in 2020.This year's new home did have its issues for organisers, with heavy traffic and transportation complications causing a particular headache for attendees at the end of the first day. A new home did give Ultra a chance to introduce new stages and refresh its Resistance Island concept though.Speaking in the wake of last month's event, Ultra’s chief of security Ray Martinez has said that he hopes to return to the key with a “well-oiled production"". He added, ""It was a great event in a beautiful location, and we look forward to being here next year and producing — and even improving on — our event and our festival.""Local officials in Miami aren't so sure about that though.

"Increased running costs would have to be shifted onto attendees...Burning Man's future and core principles have been put into jeapordy according to organisers of the event after the publishing of a new Draft Environmental Impact Statement.Despite the event pushing key values around environmental responsibility, particularly with regards to its 'Leave No Trace' policy, the statement calls for Burning Man ""to pay for maintenance of County Road 34, which leads to the event’s entrance"", though event organisers say that taxes already go towards its maintenance.Burning Man would also be expected to hire a local government-approved private security firm to ""screen for weapons and drugs in all vehicles, and to search participants, vendors, contractors, staff, and volunteers at all points of entry"" to the site. Organisers may also be expected to pay for certain barriers to be installed around the perimeter fence of the site, and cover the cost of bins being placed around the city despite their existing 'Leave No Trace' policy. This may lead to an increased cost of $286 per person planning to attend Burning Man, according to the team running the event.

"The surprising findings come as we pay less than ever for access to recorded music…Streaming is more wasteful than any other music format, according to a new study by the University of Glasgow.Despite a dramatic drop in the amount of plastic waste produced by vinyl, CDs, cassettes and other analog formats, streaming has a far worse impact on the environment. The US music industry used 58m kilograms of plastic in 1977, a figure that rose to 61m kg by the peak of CD use in 2000. While it fell to just 8m kg by 2016 as streaming took over, the energy needed to store vast amounts of data on the cloud far surpassed that of any other format. Shown as greenhouse gas equivalents (GHGs), the plastic produced and electricity used to store and transmit digital audio files was somewhere between 200m kg and 350m kg for all recorded music in 2016 in the US alone. That’s far more, comparatively than the 157m kg used in 2000.  This comes at a time when consumers have never paid less for music. While in 1977 consumers paid nearly 5% of their average weekly salary to own a vinyl album, that number has slipped to 1% in the US, as platforms like Spotify and Apple Music deliver temporary access to nearly every album available for a low monthly fee. The study’s authors note that the environmental impact they found isn’t necessarily the final word on the matter, as other factors might come into play. However, it’s worth thinking about the hidden costs of streaming next time you click play.  To help the environment, DJs for Climate Action have enlisted The Revenge, Cyril Hahn, Marcel Vogel, Fish Go Deep, Till Von Sein and others for their new party series and compilation.

"The track is the first to be shared from the forthcoming album, ‘Tim’...The first track to be shared from Avicii’s posthumous album, ‘Tim’, has been released.‘SOS’, which features vocals from the late EDM star’s ‘Wake Me Up’ collaborator Aloe Blacc, was one of a number of tracks that were near completion at the time of the 28-year-old’s tragic death in April 2018. You can hear the track below. The video for the track is comprised of messages and memories shared by fans on Avicii's official website, which has since become a memorial platform.A seven-minute video documenting the creative process of the track has also been shared. Check it out below. A statement released last week outlined that the late artist's family had ""...decided not to keep the music locked away – instead they wanted to share it with his fans all around the world”.Using the extensive notes and email chains that the beloved DJ/producer – real name Tim Bergling – left behind, his numerous collaborators and co-songwriters banded together to finish the album, which will be released in June.In a recent interview with the New York Times, producer and Avicii collaborator Carl Falk, one of the central artists in completing ‘TIM’, said, “I was trying to produce through someone else’s eyes and ears — someone who’s not here. It was really hard not to criticize yourself the whole time. Would he like this? What would he have done?”Avicii's net proceeds from the album will be donated to the Tim Bergling Foundation, which was launched in March. The project’s initial work will concentrate on offering support to individuals and organisations in the field of mental health and suicide prevention, before expanding to cover other issues such as climate change, development assistance, nature conservation and the protection of endangered species.Following Bergling’s tragic death aged just 28,  DJ Mag’s digital editor Charlotte Lucy Cijffers reflected on the young DJs enormous influence on the global EDM community and on how his openness surrounding struggles with fame, touring and alcoholism gave a troubling, if necessary, insight into a side of dance music the world often does not see.  www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Loudness Penalty shows you exactly how much your music will be attenuated across different streaming platforms…Loudness Penalty is a new plugin from MeterPlugs that lets you see exactly how much your music will be attenuated – i.e. how much its volume will be affected – across various streaming services such as Spotify and YouTube. The plugin lets you essentially preview the loudness of each platform in your DAW, rather than waiting until the music has been distributed. You could essentially master a different version to maximise sound quality across each service. Most streaming services feature a combination of compression and limiting in order to create a consistent listening experience for their users, meaning that your music could be negatively affected if it crosses a certain threshold. However, the threshold changes depending on the service, so this plugin is designed to give you the best shot at the highest quality sound. It's currently $29 for a limited time, rising to $49. Get it here. If you're interested in getting your tracks on Spotify but don't have the budget, SoundCloud recently announced their new service to distribute your music to major streaming platforms for free, provided you're a Premium customer. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Tracks from the likes of Jesse Saunders and Frankie Knuckles could now improve the commute... Chicago’s new train station features an on-site DJ booth. The installation is part of a huge $280-million revamp of the 95th Street Station on the Red Line of the city's iconic L-Train network, and has been conceived by internationally-acclaimed and locally-raised artist Theaster Gates, who also presides over Stony Island Arts Bank, home to Frankie Knuckles' record collection.  Plans for the performance space and radio station, christened 'AESOP: An Extended Voice of Our People', were finalised after consultation with residents of Chicago's South Side. They asked for something representative of their community. The result means commuters will hear playlists comprising the city's many musical luminaries— which include house music legends like Frankie Knuckles, Jesse Saunders and new XOYO resident Derrick Carter, jazz great Sonny Rollins and soul icon Aretha Franklin. According to 5 Mag Chicago, a call has also been put out for DJs who are ""invested in black music"" to perform live sets. Chicago's Mayor Rahm Emanuel showed his support via Twitter, posting images of himself checking out the decks. As part of the new design, the station has also unveiled two tapestries made from decommissioned fire hoses in a nod to the city's world-famous fire department. In other positive news from the Windy City, Smashed Plastic is the first vinyl pressing plant to become operational in Chicago for 20 years, opening in November 2018, shortly after a 96-page book went on sale celebrating classic posters and artwork from the pioneering town's early house scene.  What a thrill to join world-renowned, Chicago artist @TheasterGates to unveil new, works of art at the new 95th street redline terminal.

"The first official single ‘SOS’ will be released next week…A posthumous Avicii album will be released in June, according to an official statement released by his team.At the time of the EDM star’s tragic death on 20th April 2018 he was close to finishing a new album and, according to a statement released today, the beloved DJ/producer’s “family decided not to keep the music locked away – instead they wanted to share it with his fans all around the world”.As is explained, the sorely missed artist – real name Tim Bergling – had left behind a collection of almost finished tracks, alongside extensive notes and email messages shared with his collaborators and songwriters. Those collaborators have continued to work on the music in order to get “as close to his vision as possible”.The first track to be shared from the album, ‘SOS’, will be released next week (10th April) and will be followed by the release of the completed album, ‘TIM’ on 6th June.In a new interview with the New York Times, producer and Avicii collaborator Carl Falk, one of the central artists in completing ‘TIM’, said, “I was trying to produce through someone else’s eyes and ears — someone who’s not here. It was really hard not to criticize yourself the whole time. Would he like this? What would he have done?”Avicii's net proceeds from the album will be donated to the Tim Bergling Foundation, which was launched in March. The project’s initial work will concentrate on offering support to individuals and organisations in the field of mental health and suicide prevention, before expanding to cover other issues such as climate change, development assistance, nature conservation and the protection of endangered species.Following Bergling’s tragic death aged just 28,  DJ Mag’s digital editor Charlotte Lucy Cijffers reflected on the young DJs enormous influence on the global EDM community and on how his openness surrounding struggles with fame, touring and alcoholism gave a troubling, if necessary, insight into a side of dance music the world often does not see.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

The show will be broadcast by Boiler Room and syndicated to DJ Mag's Facebook page.The latest incarnation of the True Music project, now in its fifth year, cements Ballantine's & Boiler Room's commitment to drive forward local grassroots music scenes. Through identifying and documenting challenges at the heart of music communities, the project will birth a series of support projects to help these scenes continue to strive.Kraków's particular challenges have been highlighted in a new documentary, which is out now.'Kraków's DIY Club Community' explores the city's burgeoning underground scene; an exciting and vibrant community facing challenges related to entry fees targeted to tourists, rather than local youth and student populations.DJ Mag joined the shoot earlier this year to produce a short companion film, ‘Krakow | Stories from the City’.The second edition in our series, following episode one in Moscow, is available to view below. The film features insights from local DJs, promoters and industry insiders such as Olivia and Chino, promotion collective Techno Raczka and Paulina, curator of iconic Kraków nightclub Szpitalna 1.First and foremost a celebration Kraków's scene, the film goes on to highlight the challenges faced by the city's key progenitors ahead of outlining the steps Boiler Room & Ballantine's are taking to support the scene’s future development.The True Music Poland showcase, taking place on 25th April in Kraków, is the first step towards supporting the scene and helping the True Music community to overcome some of the challenges illuminated in the Boiler Room documentary and DJ Mag short film. The showcase pairs leading homegrown artists with international stars in an event with no door charge.""In Kraków, we were struck by the real DIY attitude towards club culture,"" says Boiler Room Founder, Blaise Belville, ""they face challenges, sure, but they’re all determined to work even harder to ensure [the scene] continues to thrive.”Supporting this DIY ethic is a long-term goal this series of True Music. The support project, set to be implemented later in the year, will usher in the launch of a fund and mentorship scheme for promoters in Kraków to produce a series of events.Ballantine's Head of Music, Tom Elton believes that the project can make a big difference in a scene that is vibrant, but facing common issues.""In Kraków, the music scene is there, and it’s awesome,"" he shares, ""but the pioneers on the ground face a common reality that putting on shows and live events is expensive and often the people most interested in attending are those with the least cash to spend on nights out: students and young adults.""truemusic.boilerroom.tvwww.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Test Pressing Festival, Terminal V, Bitch, Please!The cloven hoof of festival season is already here, as is proven by London's top pick, Hackney’s experimental and boundary-pushing Test Pressing. Everything from kraut crunch to electro bangs will be explored.It's worth noting there's another special occasion in the capital this month, as Egg hits sweet 16 and drafts some serious tech to celebrate; Nicole Moudaber, Japan's Hito and Italy's emergent Anna V are among those lighting candles. Spirit Level, meanwhile, is a new one from dnb and jungle don Mantra, where the focus is on ‘proper’ lengthy sets— Manchester’s Djinn, for example, gets no less than three hours. Check what happened when she went b2b with Mantra for DJ Mag. Bristol and Bournemouth crew Delete are kicking it with London’s Runsounds for a day-into-night-into-morning thing. Acid don October will be there, as will techno lord Jerome Hill, curveball bassist Facta and Freerotation talent, Tom Ellis. Sticking south, but away from The Big Smoke, Auf Bau’s May Day makes Tuesday seem unusually appealing— Saoirse and Moxie b2b, Scottish legends Optimo top the bill.  Edinburgh claims No.1 in its section thanks to the epic production levels and 10,000-strong crowd heading to Terminal V. Glasgow is hot on the heels, though, with Maximum Pressure hosts Slam inviting a seriously strong techno line-up to party over Easter. Miss Giant Swan, Acid Flash's IDAor top local pair Craigie Knowes and answer to us. Newcastle’s Move might be the best programmed party this month— timeless electro type DMX Krew, new school rave-resurgent Imogen and one of our Fresh Kicks interviewees, CPU Records’ 96 Back. Evidently someone knows what time it is. We’re thrilled to see Love Dose in Manchester again. Baba Stiltz flies in from Sweden, Bipolar Sunshine’s new electronic project Rabbithole gets introduced, Aus Music’s ever-sexy-sounding Cottam is there and northern stalwarts James Holroyd and Luke Unabomber play together. Wire, on the other hand, proves less can be more as enigmatic techno dramatist Redshape returns to Leeds after a five year hiatus from the city's listings, hitting the always-reliable Sub:Terranea. Bristol seems to dominate elsewhere, and not without reason. Bitch, Please! switches from Motion's big rooms to The Island, and boasts a line-up to suit (Gideön, Hannah Holland). Experimental dnb session NOISE Test returns with its second UVB-76 takeover. Catch Pessimist, Outer Heaven, Clarity and Karim Maas to guarantee satisfaction. Meanwhile, Albeit Records heads to The Queens Head for a night with Omar, whose crisp tech, deep house and off-kilter beats blew Houghton Festival away in 2018. West Country aside, Birmingham’s Hare & Hounds hosts The Orb’s 30th Anniversary Tour. The outfit still know how to do it, their hallucinatory acid house, rave and ambient hybrids vital as ever. And shout to CC:Disco, who’ll be spinning disco (no shit) at Nottingham’s Stealth, proving why she’s one of the most danceable things to come out of Australia in ages— a country we just covered with regard to its prohibitive laws and war on festivals. As ever, more complete listings are available in the current copy of DJ Mag, Issue 592, April 2019, which also includes this year’s Top 100 Clubs Poll results.  1.

Needless to say, then, we’re expecting to hear some pretty special things during this multi-venue celebration of dance music’s more experimental ends. Unusually, but also tellingly in terms of the aural offering, there’s a major leaning towards heavy live acts, which range from the bone-shattering techno of Ancient Methods to Moon Duo’s wall-of-sound psych-kraut, the gnarling industrial-edged electro of Schwefelgelb (think Factory Floor, but in a bad mood) to celebrated electro-pop emergent C.A.R. and onto minimalist composer Silvia Kastel. Other players and performances to catch have to be Lisbon’s multi-faceted Naive imprint boss, Violet (a firm favourite in the DJ Mag office), party starting London duo and former-Cheeky Bubblers Kiara Scuro, Turkish disco don Baris K, and Sc&P’s Harry James and Marcus Harris.3PM - 5AM / £302.

"The Chicago-born singer was best known for tracks including ‘Learn 2 Luv’ and ‘Nite Life’...Kim English, the iconic Chicago-born vocalist who performed on multiple house classics, has died.In a statement released last night through Nervous Records' Facebook page it was confirmed that the singer had passed away. English had been a close affiliate of the label since debuting in 1994 with her legendary track ‘Nite Life’. She went on to work with the New York label consistently right up to the release of her ‘Nothing’s Impossible’ record in 2009.“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing tonight of Kim English,” reads the statement from Nervous. “Kim’s discography includes several songs that are widely recognized as all-time classics in the house music genre. She had a unique ability both through her singing and songwriting talents to inspire people to dance and also celebrate the joys of God and religion. She was a deeply religious and devoted member of the Family Christian Center in Munster, Indiana.“While she had many opportunities to travel the globe as a singer, she remained a devoted family member and member of her church, and never allowed herself to be distracted from the path she felt was right for her. More details will be forthcoming tomorrow.”English began her career as a gospel singer before going on to work with some of the most prolific producers in ‘90s house music including Byron Burke and Byron Stingily of Ten City (‘Nite Life’), Mood II Swing (‘Learn 2 Luv’), Francios K, Masters at Work and more.Five of English’s tracks reached #1 on the Billboard Dance charts between 1999 and 2002, including ‘Unspeakable Joy’, ‘Missing You’ and ‘It Makes a Difference’.Since news broke of her passing, tributes have been pouring across social media from throughout the dance music world. Figures such as Simon Dunmore, Ce Ce Rogers, Paul Woolford, Danny Rampling and Friend Within and more have taken to Twitter to pay their respects to a truly iconic performer.   Kim English was incredible. I have been absolutely in awe of her voice since she started to release music in the 90s. It was a dream to be able to work with her in any context one day, and I felt honoured that we made it happen last year. You are irreplaceable. Rest In Peace.Just heard the sad news that Kim English has passed away. Her releases never left my box through the 90’s. Nite Life, Learn 2 Love and Supernatural, amongst others, are House classics. My thoughts & love to all @NERVOUSRECORDS & NY House fam. https://t.co/PZuELzIdYJAnother sad loss of a star of our scene gone too soon RIP Kim English thank you for the great music. Deepest condolences to family friends and all the music family Mike and and the team at Nervous Records #NYC. https://t.co/obddNnhXyCThank you Kim English for your invaluable contribution to house music.

"Alfresco Festival, AVA Festival & Conference, Wigflex City Festival... Panic on the streets, or mass protests with Massive Attack’s 3D, moors ablaze and a distressed David Attenborough. The less said about the world right now the better, then. Thankfully this month’s listings are in a healthier state, which is little compensation in the grand scheme but means we can all have a dance at least, and in nature no less. Festival highlights include the chug-friendly Alfresco in Kent, and the sublimely serene Masked Ball on the edge of a Cornish cliff complete with 24-hour license (don’t miss Bodyhammer, Dave Harvey & Felix Dickinson’s b2b or DJ Mag fave John Gomez). That’s before we come to lake and stately home-side Virgo, which bows out after this year so get involved— the talented Jacques Adda in charge of a line-up brimming with decent, not least Gwenan b2b Joe Delon, Best of British winner Willow, Night Moves co-host Jade Seatle and Mr G ‘protege’ Jayson Winters. Heading into town, Nottingham gets Wigflex’s first foray into multi-venue stuff. Check No.1 in the region for the players involved. London has plenty outside, too. Queen’s Yard Summer Party is always good, and this year’s bill is a top ad for homegrown quality; DJ Storm’s dnb, Kowton and Hodge’s Livity Sound boom, Scottish talents Craigie Knowes and Harri & Domenic, Manchester duo Blasha & Allatt. GALA is also in the capital with a strong house contingency, but it’s Donna Leake, Debora Ipekel and Ece Duzgit playing together that we’re most excited about. Not that Midland, Beautiful Swimmers and more won’t also be great. Club-wise, the Cultivated Electronics x CPU session at Corsica is more than enough— proper electro all night. Belfast’s AVA Festival & Conference is back to prove why it’s fine to pull an all-nighter then give a lecture. Riverside Festival returns to Glasgow with some pretty tempting b2bs (Rodhad with Ame, Daphni and Hunee, Objekt meets Stingray). Oh, and a stage dedicated to domestics like Thunder Disco Club and Athens of the North. FLY is also in the open air, with KiNK live, Big Miz b2b Kettama, Seth Troxler, Nina Kraviz and more. Elsewhere, Project 13 appear on our pages again— we’d leave them out if they stopped booking people like Concrete Paris must-see Deena Abdelwahed and Kazakhstan’s in-demand experimenter Nazira. Full marks for that. System & Set One Twenty’s Terrace Party hits Leeds, sporting Rhadoo and Margaret Dygas, while Musu x Colours’ hush hush hoedown in Bristol sees Nicolas Lutz share honours with Ivan Smagghe. Now that’s what we call music. More complete listings for the UK are included in this month’s edition of DJ Mag, Issue 593 (May 2019) fronted by Anastasia Kristensen.  LONDON / SOUTH1. ALFRESCO FESTIVAL  THURSDAY 23RD - MONDAY 27TH MAY 2019HOP FARM, KENT After impressing over the last couple of years, Alfresco is back and significantly expanded on its previous edition. Four days and eight stages are on the cards this time, with some seriously heavyweight crews throwing hats in, not least Andy Blake’s revered clandestine gathering, World Unknown, and London’s legendary tech crew Wiggle. If the partner hosts are impressive the line-up is equally stellar, with breadth and quality in equal measures. Headliners this time round include 2manyDJs, Erol Alkan, Joey Negro, and Maurice Fulton, not to mention live synth chap du jour, Marc Ribillet, who plays two nights. Sounds good, and that’s before you come to Bawrut, Bill Brewster, Identified Patient, Ivan Smagghe, Prins Thomas, Jennifer Cardini, Donna Leak, and the not-so-small-matter of Salons des Amateurs duo Lena Willikens and Vladimir Ivkovic b2b.

"The Chems have recounted their early experiences of raving in a new interview...The Chemical Brothers have opened up about their early experiences of raving and the “sense of community” in the ‘90s rave scene.The duo were speaking in a new interview about their forthcoming album, ‘No Geography’, which was released earlier this month (April).“I feel like movement and being together is something that is declining,” The Chemical Brothers’ Ed Simons told The Guardian. “For me, growing up, dance music was a way to socialise. It’s how I found Tom, it’s how I found a lot of friends, a sense of community. It was about creating something that brings people out, that brings people together. Loneliness is difficult, it’s a real struggle for people now. When I used to go to raves, I felt a real sense of belonging, dancing on a stage with people I would never see in my day-to-day life. People can be dismissive of all that, but it’s really liberating.”The Chemical Brothers made ‘No Geography’ on much of the equipment they made their seminal 1995 album 'Exit Planet Dust' with.“It wasn’t a plan – ‘We’re only going to do this with old-fashioned things’,” The Chemical Brothers’ Tom Rowland told The Guardian. “It was just fun to be in that 94-era machine area – where the restrictions are liberating. A lot of our records are made by shunting things together, which meant something interesting came out of it. Now technology means you can practically make anything fit with anything. Whereas then, it would be more like you get a weird place in the middle where two or three things are meeting. They’re not quite in right, they’re not quite in tune, but the sound they’re making is more interesting than something pristine. It’s so easy to make a good record that sounds like another record now.”In March, The Chemical Brothers were locked to perform at Glastonbury, alongside Stormzy, Hot Chip and Jon Hopkins and many more. The duo also shared behind the scenes footage from their 'We’ve Got To Try’ video last week.You can read our review of 'No Geography' and then reflect on the impact of their classic LP, 'Dig Your Own Hole'.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"The 16-track sequencer features heaps of performance features…Pioneer DJ have announced Toraiz SQUID: Sequencer Inspirational Device. The 16-track sequencer is designed around jamming and performance with a host of features to create 'happy accidents' and trigger random sequences, modulations and chords. There are 16 RGB pads for playing in your melodies and beats, and up to 64 patterns per each of the 16 tracks. There are eight notes of polyphony per track too, and a Harmonizer section to quickly input pre-determined chord shapes into your pattern, with up to six saved chords.The Speed Modulation section allows you to temporarily interrupt the tempo of the pattern to create unique grooves, while the 'Interpolation' feature will 'fill in' the steps between parameters across the sequence. That means that if you set a parameter – such as filter cutoff – on step one as 10 and the cutoff to 100 on step 16, SQUID will automatically scale the cutoff from 10 to 100 across the steps in between. The direction in which the sequence runs can also be easily adjusted with the with reverse, random, upside down and alternating left and right all options to create happy accidents and less predictable sequencers. The Groovebend is a spring-loaded crossfader to add extra swing to the pattern, either slowing down or speeding up a groove.Round back there are two Gate and CV outs, MIDI DIN, USB for MIDI and project/pattern transfer but crucially, there is no audio output. SQUID is exclusively a sequencer and doesn't store any sounds on the device itself, which goes a long way to explaining the low price of £519. We'll have a lot more info and a full review once the SQUID lands. Unlike the Toraiz SP-16, the SQUID doesn't feature Pioneer DJ's ProLink clocking connections, so you can't connect directly to a CDJ, but considering the much lower price, it's not that surprising. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Robert del Naja helped kick off the second week of non-violent disruption... Massive Attack’s 3D played a surprise set at London's ongoing Extinction Rebellion protest, which is now in its second week. The producer, DJ and artist, AKA Robert del Naja, took to the stage on Monday night in support of the non-violent movement, which is demanding political leaders take action to tackle global warming and climate change as a matter of urgency. Massive Attack, who recently had to postpone their forthcoming tour due to illness, have a long history of political activism, as is chronicled in a new book on the band, 'Out of the Comfort Zone'. Issues such as British foreign and domestic policies, human rights, the Trident nuclear programme, civil rights, the displacement of people and refugee crises in locations such as Palestine, Lebanon and Syria have all been on their agenda. Watch clips from del Naja's set below, then read our opinion piece exploring dance music's role in destroying the environment, featuring DJs For Climate Action, a global organisation that recently dropped a fundraising compilation.  Tranquil moment in DJ set from 3D @MassiveAttackUK at Marble Arch #ExtinctionRebellion.

Last Friday, the group released Map of the Soul: Persona, a seven-track EP modeled after Carl Jung's approach to psychology. Twenty-four hours later, they made history as the first K-pop group to perform on Saturday Night Live. This shouldn't surprise anyone who has been paying attention to the groundbreaking career the seven-member group has managed to forge for themselves, as the first K-pop band to win a Billboard Music Award and present at the Grammys. Hours before their performance, YouTube confirmed that their ""Boy with Luv"" video broke the record for most views in 24 hours, beating Ariana Grande's 55.4 million views for ""thank u, next."" As of today, ""Boy With Luv"" has over 131 million views. Introduced by K-pop fan Emma Stone, BTS grooves to their pop record in matching suits with no sign of Halsey in sight. They don't need her though, one benefit of their rigorous touring schedule over the last couple years is that they've become pretty tight performers. Halsey is expected to join the group next month for the Billboard Music Awards. Watch their historic performances of ""Boy with Luv"" and ""Mic Drop"" below.

"On the strength of ""7 Rings,"" Ariana Grande's been sitting pretty atop the Billboard Hot 100 for the better part of the last two months. Remember how she commanded all that attention during the Grammys, despite not being in attendance? Well today, she's become self aware about her dominance with a new single called ""Monopoly."" It's a collaboration with the R&B singer Victoria Monét and sports a chorus in which the pair profess to ""Treat my goals like property / Collect them like Monopoly."" Like all the music she's released in her recent hot streak it's a low-lit, low-key sorta affair, built around a loping beat that allows the pair plenty of room to flex about all the champagne they downed while making thank u, next and shout out celebrity vocal coaches. Tales of unmitigated success haven't felt terribly relatable to me lately, but hey at least someone's happy! Join me in playing this on repeat and summoning the end of this hell winter.

" Back when Ezra Koenig first shared details of Vampire Weekend’s upcoming fourth album  Father of the Bride, he revealed that the band would be releasing two songs from the LP each month before the its May 3 release. After two-track drops in February (“Harmony Hall” and “2021”) and March (“Sunflower” and “Big Blue”), the final pair of singles hit the internet this morning called “This Life” and “Unbearably White.” The first track, “This Life,” might be the most sonically upbeat of the six previews of the forthcoming 18-song album so far. While the song’s got a peppy and prominent guitar riff, the song’s lyrical content is hardly sunny. At one point, Koenig signs, “Oh Christ, am I good for nothing?” It was co-produced by Koenig and Ariel Rechtshaid, features a wealth of collaborators like backing vocals from Danielle Haim, guitar from Koenig’s Beats 1 Time Crisis co-host Jake Longstreth, and production credits from Chromeo. As Pitchfork points out, Koenig interpolates lyrics from iLoveMakonnen’s “Tonight” when he sings, “You’ve been cheatin’ on, cheatin’ on me/I’ve been cheatin’ on, cheatin’ on you.” “Unbearably White,” the second single, is much more chill and moody. Featuring additional production from Grimes and Justin Bieber collaborator BloodPop. Here, Koenig sings, “There's an avalanche coming / Don't cover your eyes / Is what you thought you wanted.” Listen to both tracks below.

"Given Weezer's recent dedication to going As Viral As Possible at all times, it's kind of a wonder that they haven't already hit NPR's Tiny Desk—one of the few chances for artists entrenched in the Content Economy to get a bunch of press for doing music stuff. But hey, they resolved that today with a wonderfully loose 16-minute set that included new singles, old hits, and even an underheard rarity called ""Longtime Sunshine."" They open with that cut, before transitioning into The Black Album's ""Living in LA"" and the Pinkerton jam ""Across the Sea."" It's a nice smattering of stuff from across their whole career, but what's most notable is how free-flowing the whole thing feels. Part of what's kept me from digging as deep into Weezer's recent material is how intensely produced it all feels. The emotions these songs express aren't so neat and tidy, so it's fitting to hear them in a way that's a little woolier, without the scalpel-like precision of the studio cuts. Also, in case Rivers Cuomo's weirdness is what you're after he ends the set by saying ""We're Weezer from planet Earth! Have a nice life!""

"Punk supergroup, OFF!, comprised of Keith Morris (ex-Black Flag, Circle Jerks), Steven McDonald (Melvins, Redd Kross), Mario Rubalcaba (Earthless, Hot Snakes), and Dimitri Coats (ex-Burning Brides,) has been delivering ballads of madness and lunacy via VICE Records since the release of the First Four EPs in 2010. Each of their three LP’s have been decorated with Raymond Pettibon imagery, and have driven directly and unabashedly to the various points of cruelty and obstruction on the perilous sphere known as Earth.With no shortage of such in 2019, the group returns with a fresh attempt to immobilize the legion of evil, and announces their next album,  Watermelon, slated for early 2020 release via VICE Records.The album comes alongside Watermelon, the film, teased as a science fiction comedy in which many of the actors and musicians who have appeared in OFF!’s music videos (including Jack Black, David Yow, Dave Foley, Brian Posehn, Jack Grisham, etc.) are anticipated to participate.""The film is the catalyst that opened the door to a new experimental direction for the album. By thinking of the material as a soundtrack, it allowed us to get weird,” says Dimitri Coats.The band is driving supporters to pledge donations via a Kickstarter campaign for the film, offering limited edition merch, including exclusive Raymond Pettibon prints, skate decks, and the opportunity to be in the film itself.

"BeyHive!! To quote the 1994 hit ""Blind"" from nü metal ban Korn, are yooouuuuu REAADDDYYYYY???The wild-ass streets of the internet were brought a moment of joyousness last night when Netflix tweeted out an announcement for, well, something around Beyoncé’s legendary Coachella performance. The teaser image simply read Homecoming, written in the same font used on all of Bey’s Coachella merch and costumes, so the people of Twitter came to a very exciting conclusion: Beyoncé is coming. What was coming though was uncertain: a possible documentary (?), concert film (?), 15-hour slam poetry reading from various fans about the experience of that night (?). But as of Monday morning, we learned via a teaser video dropped in the early a.m. that Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé is an ""intimate, in-depth look at Beyoncé's celebrated 2018 Coachella performance [that] reveals the emotional road from creative concept to cultural movement.""Again, I ask, are yooouuuuu REAADDDYYYYY???Last year, Bey headlined both weekends of the music festival, and stans around the world either powered through their weird molly sweats or gathered before their laptops to marvel in the majesty of our queen giving us plebs two hours of EVERYTHING—An HBCU-themed performance complete with marching band, dancers, a drop in from J.

"Photo courtesy of Columbia RecordsLate last month, Billboard removed Lil Nas X’s viral sensation “Old Town Road” from its weekly Hot Country Songs chart. A representative told Rolling Stone, “While ‘Old Town Road’ incorporates references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.” Though the move was controversial and wrong-headed, it has only helped the “cowboy trap” hit. Last night, the song, which was No. 15 last week, dethroned Ariana Grande’s “7 Rings” to top the Billboard’s Hot 100 and become the No. 1 song in America.For Lil Nas X, who was born Montero Lamar Hill and is celebrating his 20th birthday today, his chart victory is notable for a lot of reasons. Because Billboard tracks sales and streaming numbers from Friday to Thursday, “Old Town Road” hit number one without the help of Billy Ray Cyrus’ already-ubiquitous remix which dropped Friday, April 5. However, if (or rather, when) the song repeats its chart performance next week, it’ll be Cyrus’ first Hot 100 No. 1 as his 1992 single “Achy Breaky Heart” only peaked at No. 4. Since “Old Town Road” samples banjo from Nine Inch Nails’ 2008 track “34 Ghost IV,” the song marks NIN's Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross first appearance at No. 1 as writers and producers. The song has also topped Billboard’s Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and Hot Rap Songs charts. Had Billboard not removed “Old Town Road” from its country charts, the track would’ve certainly topped it this week.The undeniable success of “Old Town Road” has coincided with increased criticism against Billboard’s exclusion of the song in its country charts. Lil Nas X has defended the song, telling TIME, “The song is country trap. It’s not one, it’s not the other. It’s both. It should be on both [charts].” Several artists have supported Lil Nas X and spoken out against Billboard like Moses Sumney, who wrote on Twitter, “Lil Nas X's country chart removal is discriminatory considering how hip hop production is appropriated in today's pop-country; white artists like Sam Hunt top the charts with it. Once again the message to black artists is clear: we can have y'alls shit, but y'all can't have ours.” Country singer singer Meghan Linsey added, “That is some BS. It’s got plenty of “country elements” and [it’s] as “country” as anything on country radio, tbh.”As NPR’s Ann Powers points out in an excellent Twitter thread, this isn’t just a country music issue: “I appreciate the work happening to make people aware of the black roots of and connections to country. BUT labeling every black Southern/Western legacy artist ""country"" risks delegitimizing the crucial genres they also represented. Sam Sanders, host of NPR's  It's Been A Minute, chimed in, saying, “who decides what is or isn't country music is very subjective. Lots of folks are saying 'Hey, Billboard, Hey, country, You allow white artists to get on these charts with songs that aren't quite country all the time.’” Considering Bebe Rexha and Florida Georgia Line’s “Meant to Be” topped the country charts with similar sonic elements as “Old Town Road,” Sanders has a point.Cyrus said in a statement, “Country music fans decide what they like. Not critics or anyone else. I’ve always said, don’t think inside the box, don’t think outside the box. Think like there is no box.” Given his appearance on the remix, Billboard may soon reverse course. In a statement over the weekend, Billboard opened the possibility of reversing its decision: “Our initial decision to remove “Old Town Road” from the Hot Country Songs chart could be revisited as these factors evolve.” While Cyrus’ remix is a welcome addition, here’s hoping artists of color don’t need to enlist white pop-country mainstays in the future to prove their genre bonafides.

"Shareif Ziyadat/Getty ImagesRapper Nipsey Hussle has died, after being shot outside his clothing shop in Los Angeles on Sunday, March 31. The city mayor's Crisis Response Team confirmed the tragic news on Sunday evening. Hussle was 33 years old. An important member of his community, Hussle (born Ermias Ashgedom) was known not just for his music—which included a series of acclaimed mixtapes, as well as the famous YG collaboration ""FDT"" (aka Fuck Donald Trump)—but also his investments in the people and businesses of the Crenshaw area of LA. Hussle had just purchased the L-shaped plaza where his clothing store, Marathon Clothing, was located. In February 2019, Forbes reported that self-made millionaire Hussle and his business partner had purchased the lot for ""a couple million"" and had plans to turn it into a six-story residential building, with a revamped shopping area below. It was the next step in Hussle's entrepreneurial career, which at one point saw him sell a mixtape for $100 (Jay Z bought 100 copies). His debut album Victory Lap received a nomination for best rap album at this year's Grammy Awards, sliding in next to records from Cardi B, Mac Miller, Pusha T and Travis Scott. Drake, who won a Grammy that evening and collaborated with Hussle in 2009, took to Instagram with a tribute. ""My whole energy is just at a low right now hearing this. We just linked for the first time in years and said we were gonna do a new song this summer cause it had been too long,"" he wrote. ""You were having the best run and I was so happy watching from distance fam nobody ever talks down on your name you were a real one to your people and to the rest of us.""The Canadian rapper was one of many global stars to react to Nipsey Hussle's death, proof of his impact close to home and far beyond. While on stage in Buenos Aires, fellow south Los Angeles resident Kendrick Lamar led a moment of silence, describing Nipsey Hussle as ""our brother, our warrior, our soldier."" Rihanna, J Cole, Meek Mill, and Chance The Rapper are among many other names to pay their respects. Hussle was one of three victims in the shooting and the LAPD are currently looking for a suspect. The city's mayor took to Twitter to condemn the violence, stating: ""Our hearts are with the loved ones of Nipsey Hussle and everyone touched by this awful tragedy.

You can workout in Beyoncé's Ivy Park athleisure line (and soon with sneakers to match), or create a whole makeup look with Rihanna's Fenty Beauty.

The thank u, next singer is reportedly joining the beauty industry with a line inspired by her recent album. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Grande filed a trademark on April 2 for a line that includes ""fragrances, body lotion, bath and shower gels, body scrubs, body powders, body mists, and more."" It wouldn't be the first time Grande tried her hand at beauty, but it does seem like the singer is trying hard to channel the spirit of thank u, next, which does have a song titled ""makeup.""

"Photo by Mike Coppola/Wire ImageIt's been almost a year since Janelle Monáe released her magnum opus Dirty Computer, an album as equally pop as it is R&B. The album appeared at the top of countless year-end lists, including ours, and was nominated for Album of the Year at this year's Grammys. Much of the conversation around the album, however, was centered around Monáe's sexuality—a topic she kept at a distance with aliases and love stories about cyborgs in albums like Metropolis: The Chase Suite and The Archandroid. In an interview with Rolling Stone ahead of Dirty Computer's release, Monáe addressed her sexuality explicitly for the first time, revealing that she identifies as a pansexual although she considers herself a ""free-ass motherfucker."" Now, Monáe is ready to let us in some more. ""I was terrified. [...] I thought people were gonna say, 'Oh, she's doing this as a publicity stunt,'"" she tells the body-positive rapper, Lizzo. In the debut cover story for them, a new LBTQ community-driven magazine, the singer reveals how she felt coming out, the liberation of Dirty Computer, and how it feels to be young, black, wild, and free in conversation with Lizzo.Throughout much of the interview, Monáe explores the intersections of her identities, not afraid to highlight the ways society has at times made her feel unwelcome. ""I mean, to be young, queer, and black in America means that you can be misunderstood,"" she says. ""You can be hated. It also means that you can be celebrated and loved."" This is the foundation Dirty Computer was made on, and a theme on which the film that accompanies the album rests. She is cast out from a world that rejected her, but she eventually finds the community that embraces her. ""I just hope we can get to a point where black women who don’t identify as strictly heterosexual are normalized."" For Monáe, creating the album was a step in being the fullest version of herself. She says: With Dirty Computer, I made a bigger declaration to myself—that I'm not putting out an album if I can't be all of me. You're gonna take the blackness, you're gonna take the fact that I love science fiction. You're gonna take the fact that I am a free-ass motherfucker. You're gonna take that all in and because that is what you're gonna get.Before Monáe was able to find the liberation she displayed to the world, she needed to be able to express her sexuality to her family. ""I grew up [...], in a very small town, and I went to a Baptist church; to be anything other than heterosexual is a sin in that community, and growing up, I was always told I'd go to hell if I was,"" she tells Lizzo. ""There was a part of me that had to deal with what that meant."" She continues: After I had those conversations with myself and I saw a therapist, I had to be able to talk about what it meant to identify as bisexual. What does that mean? How would discovering that impact the relationship I was in at the time? How do I talk about it with my family? How do I go back to my church? [...] I leaned into the idea that if my own church won't accept me, I'm gonna create my own church.The interview between Janelle Monáe and Lizzo is probably the best thing you'll read all morning. The two speak candidly and without judgment to each other, and the rest of the world could probably take notes. Monáe might be doing the work within herself, along with her grassroots group Fem the Future, but she's not necessarily counting on the rest of the entertainment industry. ""I think the entertainment industry has not caught up,"" she says. ""[...]It’s about normalizing and telling more stories, and inviting more LGBTQIA+ folks into the conversation on the front end, and giving us a seat at the table early on. Because we can’t afford to see things in a binary way. That’s not how the world works.""Kristin Corry is a staff writer for Noisey.

"Prince Williams/Getty ImagesOn March 31, rapper Nipsey Hussle was shot and killed outside his clothing store in Los Angeles. He was 33. His memorial service is today at the Staples Center, and it's being streamed online. During the ceremony, Hussle's longtime friend Karen Civil read a heartfelt letter from Barack Obama where the former President celebrated the late artist's life and legacy. In the letter, Obama explained that though he had never met Nipsey Hussle, he had been introduced to his music by his daughters. He wrote, “While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and only see gangs, bullets, and despair, Nipsey saw hope. He saw potential. He saw a community that even though its flaws, taught him to always keep going.” The letter continues, listing his work around his home, ""He set an example for young people to follow and is a legacy worthy to follow.” Read the full letter below and watch a clip from the reading here.

"Photo by Renata RakshaThere was once a time that the producer and director best known as Flying Lotus made things easy on his audiences. He made woozy, uncomplicated beatwork—he won over bros by dropping EDM remixes of Waka Flocka Flame hits. Those halcyon days are a distant memory in 2019, though. The last decade has seen the man born Steven Ellison diving ever-deeper into freak shit. He's made songs inspired by near-death experiences and the spirit molecule, and he also directed his first feature-length film—a body horror so gross it inspired walkouts at Sundance. This is what he considers ""just having fun"" now. So it's fitting then that the first taste of his just-announced sixth album Flamagra is as surreal and overwhelming as it is. ""Fire Is Coming"" begins with ominously wheezing soundscapes and screaming children, moving subtly through Psycho-esque orchestration, before none other than Dvid Lynch shows up to tell an apocalyptic short story about a kid named Tommy who answers an ominous phone call, and his mom who runs into a problem in her garden involving some sort of black slime. He repeats the title of the song like a siren. It's upsetting, and even more so when coupled with the video—directed by Ellison and David Firth (who you might know as the Salad Fingers guy)—which features Lynch telling the story from inside the mouth of a wolf in a wheelchair. It's a lot. It's hard to say at this juncture if the rest of the record will hold this end-of-days tone, but Flying Lotus himself suggests in a press release that the flames that Lynch describes are at the center of it. “I’d been working on stuff for the past five years, but it was always all over the place. I’d always had this thematic idea in mind—a lingering concept about fire, an eternal flame sitting on a hill,” He says. “Some people love it, some people hate it. Some people would go on dates there and some people would burn love letters in the fire.” Still, even if it's as heavy as this song, at least he's facing the end of the world with some friends. Flamagra will feature contributions from a star-studded cast of collaborators including Solange, Tierra Whack, Anderson .Paak, George Clinton, Little Dragon, Denzel Curry, David Lynch, Shabazz Palaces, Thundercat, and Toro y Moi.

"Photo courtesy Fender The final season of Game of Thrones premiered Sunday but you probably already know this because a record 17.4 million people tuned in and your Twitter timeline will not shut up about it. On top of that, there have been a staggering amount of bonkers cross-promotional marketing campaigns advertising the show. Nabisco recreated the title sequence entirely with Oreos, Mountain Dew released “A Can Has No Name” referencing something that happened a couple seasons ago, and Shake Shack has a few Westeros-themed menu options. If that all seems like a bit much, well, too fucking bad because Fender has just unveiled a ridiculous and gaudily expensive line of custom made guitars in collaboration with the longrunning HBO flagship program.  Coming from the Fender Custom Shop, you can now buy three one-of-a-kind guitars that according to a press release was inspired by “from each house’s family sigil, costume designs, armor and weaponry, as well as each of their locations in Westeros.” The line includes the House Stark Telecaster ($25,000), which boasts faux wolf fur lining in the case, the House Lannister Jaguar ($30,000) that comes in finished “Lannister Gold” and “Burnt Crimson,” and the House Targaryen Stratocaster ($35,000) that features a “dragon scaled” body. All models are made to order by Fender’s Principal Master Builder Ron Thorn.  While you likely don’t have tens of thousands of dollars burning a hole in your pocket, you can watch an admittedly sick demo of Tom Morello, Nuno Bettencourt, Scott Ian,  Game of Thrones showrunner Dan Weiss and composer Ramin Djawadi trying out the guitars.

" Girl Ultra really likes movies. She likes them so much, her entire persona serves as a sort of character driving her artistic narrative. “I see Girl Ultra as a character who isn’t necessarily me––who has phases and seasons, and this is certainly the new season.” says the Mexican R&B singer whose real name is Mariana De Miguel.  In the past, she’s cited golden-age Mexican cinema––and the incomparable divas who propelled the movement––as inspiration for her artistic persona. Silvia Pinal, one of her favorites, went from mainstream star to experimental film lead and Luis Bunuel muse when the societal norms in Mexico fatigued her. In what can perhaps be considered a shadowing of Pinal’s trajectory, Girl Utlra’s new video “Ella Tu y Yo,” from her forthcoming debut full-length album  Nuevos Aires, finds the 23-year-old singer veering away from classic imagery and into a techno-surrealist David Cronenberg-influenced reality. “It’s very much inspired by ‘Videodrome.’” says De Miguel. “I got really hooked on science fiction movies recently, and I wanted to incorporate this reality of screens sort of taking control over our lives.”  The first half of the video finds De Miguel literally plugged in to a circle of screens, as she bemoans an unnamed woman’s intrusion into her relationship via social media. “What I wanted to portray was the thought of being connected to screens and sort of having another person involved in a traditional relationship...this idea that there’s this other person connected to me who knows me just through a screen, and the paranoia that develops as a result.” On the song, she laments, “No se donde empieza ella/Y donde termino yo” (I don’t know where she begins/And where I end), making the juxtaposition of Gen Z fears with Gen X sci-fi body horror nostalgia clear.  Sonically, “Ella Tu y Yo” draws from punchy, nostalgic R&B––owing as much to artists like Al B Sure and Sade as it does to contemporaries like Frank Ocean or Finesse label mate Jesse Baez. “This song is the sound of the upcoming album. It’s what defines the new sound moving forward.” says De Miguel. “The connecting thread on this album are the sounds of the early 90s and late 80s. It leans a bit towards that 80s nostalgia” she says, noting those are the sounds she remembers hearing as a child.  Those sounds of much of the popular R&B many millennials and Gen Zers grew up consuming is what partially informs this new wave of Mexican, and Latin American R&B. “I want to make Mexican R&B more global. I want it to escape the CDMX niche, and to actually grow more and encompass all the Latin American R&B we’re seeing now.” she says. And with the small, yet quickly growing Latin American R&B scene being partially spearheaded by Finesse Records, artists like Teen Flirt, Coral Casino and Santa Bandida are getting their music outside of their niche circles. “I think when there’s only one or two artists making certain styles of music, it’s too small. When it’s a lot of us and it sort of becomes a movement, it really helps create a scene that can be recognized and lauded.” she says.  Additionally, her broad range of forthcoming collaborations both inform her music and help her connect with different facets of her Latinx roots. “The [upcoming] song with Ximena [Sariñana] sounds more like the kind of pop  she’s known for. The [upcoming] song with Cuco has that Cali sound. I also want to amplify the possibilities and take away and preconceived notions of how the genre ‘should’ sound, and who we’re ‘supposed’ to collaborate with.” she says.  De Miguel also wants to use her music to connect with the Latin diaspora across the world. “On the last tour, I didn’t expect anyone to know who I was, and I was shocked at the turnout in places like Raleigh, North Carolina. Like, I’d never been to North Carolina, and I’d show up and to see the Latin American community there–-with such a strong support system–– it was incredible.” she gushes.  With this new release and upcoming tour, she hopes to continue to connect with Latin American fans, and non Latin American fans alike. “I get so excited to travel the world and even if it’s just someone saying hi in Spanish, its like your roots are giving you a big hug. The acceptance transcends borders and barriers, it’s the warmth that Latinos have. It’s a warmth our culture has and it never ceases to amaze me. And the amazing thing about R&B, it’s it’s so passionate, it breaks language barriers because the sounds, the progressions, they come from the gut.” she says, at this moment very obviously speaking as Mariana De Miguel. But suddenly, Girl Ultra takes over and she adds one last observation–-complete with its Cronenberg-esque sci-fi connotations. “It’s almost like we all have a little chip implanted in us that makes us inherently understand and appreciate these wonderful R&B melodies.” Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Gen Z', 'Gen X', 'Al B Sure', 'Frank Ocean', 'Those', 'De Miguel', 'Latinos']"
" Every week, the Noisey staff puts together a list of the best and most important albums, mixtapes, and EPs from the past seven days. Sometimes it includes projects we’ve written about on the site already; sometimes it's just made up of great records that we want everyone to hear, but never got the chance to write about. The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.PersonaThere are seven tracks on  Map of the Soul: Persona, seemingly one for every member of Korea’s global pop stars, BTS. The album’s title makes reference to  Jung’s Map of the Soul, which explored the fundamentals of psychology according to Carl Jung. For 26 minutes, the boys of BTS are prepared to ask you the existential questions you’ve been avoiding as they do on the guitar-laden, soul sampling opener “Intro: Persona.” RM, the frontrunner of the group code-switches and weaves Korean and English into the track. “Who the hell am I?” he asks. “Where’s your soul? Where’s your dream?” At a glance, it feels like the beginning of a BTS-led psychoanalysis spread across sweet pop records like “Boy U Luv,” a collaboration with Halsey and the R&B-inspired “Home.” Class is in session on  Map of the Soul and BTS wants to see who’s been paying attention.  —Kristin CorryVenturaThere are few people who can get Andre 3000 to come out of hiding, but Anderson .Paak is one of them. Five months after releasing  Oxnard last year, Anderson .Paak is flexing his connections by putting OutKast’s famed Andre 3000 on Ventura’s opening track. “Come Home” transports you to the “ain’t too proud to beg” rhetoric that was the thesis of soul music. “I’m begging you, please come home / No one even begs anymore,” .Paak sings on the hook. 3 Stacks picks up .Paak’s lead: “If your gut tells you to strut, then strut / Then I’ll hail you a car, but what man won’t beg?” The Atlanta rapper isn’t the only legendary feature .Paak snagged.  Ventura is filled with collaborations like a posthumous feature from Nate Dogg (“What Can We Do?”) and “Make It Better,” which finds Smokey Robinson on its hook. This album, like  Oxnard, is a musing on the sounds he was raised on and the West Coast singer is begging for the trappings of home.  —Kristin CorryARIZONA babyA proud pop weirdo sheds some of his woolier layers, just in time for spring. Aided by Jack Antonoff, Kevin Abstract’s sound is a bit more concrete on this three-track EP, bolstering his slippery surrealisms with solid choruses and shimmery horns. Antonoff’s been both celebrated and scapegoated for the polish he brings to the iconoclasts he works with, but this level of sheen suits Abstract, who glistens here in the spotlight. There’s rumored to be more installments of this coming later on this month, which is worth being excited for, but these three songs are gems on their own. —Colin JoyceLet’s Try The After Pt. 2 As Broken Social Scene hits its two decade mark as a sprawling Toronto collective responsible for some of the finest indie rock albums of the 2000s, it’s clear their best songs are the ones where they really go for catharsis (“Superconnected,” “It’s All Gonna Break,” “Anthems for a Seventeen Year-Old Girl,” and many others). On their last of two 2019 EPs  Let’s Try The After Part 2, they hit the mark with the boisterous and thoughtful “Can’t Find My Heart,” a roaring track that features fuzzy guitar leads and an explosive chorus. The rest of the EP goes in a decidedly more electronic direction with programmed drums and Auto-Tune (“Big Couches, “Wrong Line”), but while those flourishes are a shock on first listen, it’s still got the familiar hug of Broken Social Scene’s charm.  — Josh Terry FriendsYou can easily hear Omar Apollo’s influences on  Friends. He’s serving Prince in the basslines and falsetto of “Ashamed.” On “Trouble” there’s a little bit of Maxwell in his breathy croon. And throughout the EP, it’s hard not to draw similarities to Miguel in his voice. Apollo, who taught himself to sing by watching YouTube videos, has started to find his groove with this extremely relistenable seven-song project. It leaves us wanting more from the 21-year-old Indiana native. So we’ll make one request: Please, Omar, lean into that groove and make a full funk album.  —Leslie HornIntellexualThe 12-track LP takes more cues from Paul Simon, Labi Siffre, and Joni Mitchell than it does any rapper that Chicago mainstays Nico Segal and Nate Fox have worked with worked with. But while there are acoustic guitars and live takes, there are a wealth of collaborators and fascinating sonic surprises throughout. No folk-inspired LP has ever featured footwork veteran DJ Spinn providing drums or a Bossa Nova-inflected interlude featuring Esperanza Spalding called “Boca."" —Josh Terry Let’s RideOne of Oz’s finest dancefloor fillers joins up with the inimitable Dekmantel label for a record of windows-down, wide-open-spaces techno tracks. Roza Terenzi offers a handful of different moods here—psychedelic headtrips like “Bricks,” low-slung quasi rap beats like “Freak n Tweak”—but they’re united in their openness. They’re tailor made for speeding through the countryside, without another soul in sight. —Colin JoyceMezzi Umani Mezze MacchineThe anarchic structure and hilarious name of the Bristol-based label/collective Avon Terror Corps says a lot about how they operate. It can be hard to tell exactly who’s involved in the project—there’s reportedly representatives of a wide swath of the UK freak scene—but like a multi-level marketing scheme turned into a militia, their numbers vast, hungry, and ready to fight. That was exemplified on their debut release a couple of months ago—the compilation  Avon is Dead, which found them twisting and torturing tropes of techno, noise, and hardcore into this surreal cyberpunk melange. Their first proper LP, care of the duo Kinlaw and Franco Franco, further demonstrates the sort of firestarters Avon are. Trap signifiers and scabrous noise get thrown into the magic bullet here, with Franco Franco dizzily spitting in Italian over the top. In a post-Death Grips world, there’s a fair amount of freaks playing with these sounds. Bands like Deli Girls and Prison Religion are spiritual cousins to what’s going on here, but Kinlaw and Franco’s take on the sounds is a little different. It’s wounded, wheezing, and worldly bathed in the scum of stagnating puddles on the street. “Cuore Molle Palle Mosce” was the project’s debut single, but it’s still the best bite-sized summation of what the duo do well—take familiar sounds and set them aflame.  —Colin JoyceIn The Shape of a StormSince his ninth album 2010’s  Saint Bartlett, Damien Jurado has enjoyed a near-unmatched string of excellent LPs like his  Maraqopa trilogy (2012’s  Maraqopa, 2014’s  Brothers and Sisters of the Eternal Son, and 2016’s  Visions of Us on the Land, all recorded with the late producer Richard Swift) and 2018’s  The Horizon Just Laughed. Where  The Horizon Just Laughed stripped back the psychedelia and sci-fi elements of his previous efforts with Swift thanks to Jurado’s self-production, his latest  In The Shape of a Storm is entirely barebones. It’s Jurado and his guitar and some of his most affecting songwriting to date. The sparse recordings don’t hinder these tunes as “Throw Me In Your Arms” and the peppy “Where You Want Me To Be” are both immediate and infectious.  —Josh TerrySulphur EnglishThe Richmond heavies Inter Arma have this knack for writing songs that feel at once claustrophobic and anthemic—ornamental and crushing. Their new album,  Sulphur English, is full of moments that unite these two sides of their sound. The riffs on songs like “Citadel” are twisted and serpentine, full of these lovely flourishes and unexpected lead fills. But they’re muddy and crushing too. It kinda feels like they’ve taken the whole of the palace at Versailles and dropped it right on your head. You can appreciate the proximity to such beauty and craft, but it hurts too. Something tells me they like it that way.  —Colin JoyceThis Wild WillingGlen Hansard's fourth solo album  This Wild Willing feels like a reinvention in the Irish songwriter's almost three decades long career. The hard-working journeyman Frames and Swell Season frontman, who launched into prominence thanks to his Oscar-winning work on Once, throws a curveball on this latest LP, ditching straightforwardly accessible folk-rock for knotty arrangements and dissonant experimentation. Opener ""I'll Be You, Be Me"" kicks off with a gnarly sample of Queen's ""Cool Cat"" and slowly builds to be one of the weirdest and most compelling songs of his discography. Recorded in Paris, the album features, among many others, classically trained Iranian musicians the Khoshravesh brothers and electronic musicians Dunk Murphy and Deasy who welcomely disrupt these intimate songs with searing bursts of noise.  —Josh TerryOnly You Can See ItAfter a decade making dazed pop songs, the songwriter and producer Emily Reo’s  Only You Can See It finds her snapping into alertness and focus. She shirks the reverb that was once a hallmark to see the world in all its vibrancy. It’s proggy in places—like on the amoebic skittering that underpins “Ghosting,” one of it’s finest tracks. But in spite of her complex harmonic work, for the most part this is pure pleasure—songs built to stick in your head forever. Her music’s no longer like a dream, no, it’s better. Also, if you don’t believe me, ask Ice-T.  —Colin Joyce Heavy HandedIt’s easy to get lost in the endlessly danceable and brooding synth pop of Chicago’s Pixel Grip. On their debut LP  Heavy Handed, the self-described “goth disco” trio lock into a groove of bubbly bass, throbbing drum patches, and mesmerizingly brooding vocals from lead singer Rita Lukea. Songs like “Can’t Compete” boast menacingly bass-y synth riffs and Lukea’s piercing yelps while single “Diamonds” pulsates with a beat that wouldn’t feel out of place in Caribou’s catalogue. It’s a left-field entry in Chicago’s musical landscape but these songs are strong enough that Pixel Grip can easily rise above the crowd and carve their own necessary niche in the city.  —Josh TerryVanta BlackErin Hoagg, the songwriter and producer behind the project Rare DM, named debut album under that moniker  Vanta Black, a reference to a substance that has been called “the darkest material on earth.” It absorbs 99.99% of the light that touches it, and has the effect of making any three dimensional objects to which it is applied look flat and uncanny. Yet, it’s sorta paradoxical when applied to Hoagg’s work. She deals in heavy subject matter on occasion throughout the record—the boys that waste her time, generalized loneliness and despair—but its rendered in vibrant chromatics. Her synth programming shimmers, her drum machines burst with vintage warmth. There’s a gothic air about the whole project, but make no mistake, there’s some amount of joy, or at least ecstasy informing this whole thing. But maybe that’s the point—that there’s color even in the deepest darkness.  —Colin JoyceThe concept of wishing runs deep on the nine-track EP, but “Wish (Interlude)” provides the listener with the thesis to  What You Wish For. “A wish? It’s like a deep feeling or expression of a strong desire. You know, like hope for something that’s not easily attainable,” a woman’s voice says on the track. “Not so much a request, but more of an invocation. A want for something probably won’t or can’t ever happen. But I wish that…” Her monologue could serve two purposes in that she’s longing for something more romantically, but also hoping for solidarity in the world around her. Audio from a Donald Trump rally opens  What You Wish Forwith Trump pointing out a black person at the Redding, California event. “Look at my African American over here. Look at him. Are you the greatest? You know what I’m talking about?” It's enough to make you wonder about ymtk’s musings on a wish, and why the world’s current landscape makes wishing feel impossible. —Kristin CorrySign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Every', 'Korea', 'Oxnard', 'Ventura', 'Stacks', 'Ventura', 'Oxnard', 'Kevin Abstract’s', 'Antonoff’s', 'Broken Social Scene', 'Broken Social Scene', 'Prince', 'Joni Mitchell', 'Esperanza Spalding', 'Bricks', 'Dead', 'Franco Franco', 'Franco Franco', 'Death Grips', 'Deli Girls', 'Prison Religion', 'Franco’s', 'Damien Jurado', 'The Horizon Just Laughed', 'Versailles', 'Frames and', 'Queen', 'Emily Reo’s', 'Rita Lukea', 'Caribou’s', 'Vanta Black', 'Audio']"

"Photo by Brett BaysIn the eyes of the Austinities-in-exile who make up the tightly-wound punk band Institute, everything changed in 2016. At least it felt like it did. Even if the ultra right-wing demagogues were already waiting in the wings for a signal that it was now OK to espouse their toxic ideals in public, the string of major global political happenings that year tipped the scales. “Of course [there was] Brexit, then Trump, and then the myriad faux-populist, border-tightening fascists other countries have been flirting with since,” the band’s singer Moses Brown says via email. “People are going to look back and see that year as a huge sea change as far as the perception of the world they live in.” From their start around a half decade ago, Institute has been band of agitators, crafting tensile and anxious songs—playing grayscale post-punk with a Stoogian swagger. But they used to operate on a smaller, more personal level. Their songs dealt with Brown’s immediate concerns and poetic existential musings. But given the way the world’s turned, he says, he was forced to think bigger. “It felt inevitable, as a band actively recording music right now,” he says. “What are you doing if you’re not addressing this absurd world?”It’s tricky to tackle that kind of project head-on, without it coming off as, frankly, kinda corny and naive. But Brown—now based in New York, alongside guitarist Arak Avakian—is a perceptive writer and thinker. In a statement about the band’s new album  Readjusting the Locks, out May 17 on Sacred Bones, he wrote thoughtfully about the current state of deadlock that dominates American society. “We are stubborn, despite what we’ve preached our entire existence, we do not possess the ability to create a truly just and sustainable ‘utopia’ on this earth,” he writes. “Nor do we have the time to reassess the future currently in store for us—thus humanity will perpetually be 'READJUSTING THE LOCKS' of our existential crisis in order to socially manage a decline into absolution (as has proven to be the path of least resistance).” It’s sort of a pessimist's take on the situation, but most days that feels like a reasonable one. Even the most theoretically trustworthy leaders in this country country are beholden to the interests of corporations and banks—institutions whose very existence is interwoven with a history of colonial violence and white supremacy. Brown says his own moments of hopelessness come from mundane reminders of these broader structural problems, like when he’s walking down a street looking at houses, or perusing ads on the subway. “I love looking at homes but they are also this perfect symbol of middle class American economic stability,” Brown says. “So seeing and appreciating property is just another slap in the face of reality. I’m walking down the block and the widening economic gap is there just lurking in my head. It’s especially bad in Austin where all the houses in the neighborhood I grew up in, you can’t afford without a tech salary.”That everyday dread is coupled with the march toward another election cycle, in which, Brown says, no one seems equipped to “writing truly effective policy” or upholding existing ideas—like the Green New Deal or Universal Basic Income—that could stand to truly improve the lives of marginalized people in the country and around the world. This is the backdrop for  Readjusting the Locks, 13 tracks more anxious and upset than Institute has ever felt before. It’s their third record for Sacred Bones, and it’s the most wound-up and unsettled by a long shot. Press materials cite ‘77 punk as a possible reference point, but that doesn’t really seem to capture the spirit of it—not exactly. Those bands were having a good time, and this record—even at its most “rockin’” moments, like the chugging opener MPS—has this undertone of dread. You can hear it in the way the rhythms sorta unravel, or in Brown’s wheezy resignation. There’s this feeling that everything might not be alright in the end. According to Brown, it might not be. “The fabric of society has us moving too fast towards environmental collapse without the ability to stop and take care of earth and everyone on it,” he says. “It’s time to stop progressing into the future.”So then the question is: what do we do? What choices can we make in the face of a world like this?“Goddamn I don’t think anyone can answer these questions,” he says. “Vote and love the people close to you? I mean what else are we supposed to do? Think critically and take care of yourself? No one has these answers and nobody will.”One unspoken answer is: make a rock record. It can seem like a futile gesture in some ways. Riffs and amplifier feedback can’t stem the tides of fascism, or turn back the ticking clock of climate change. But there is a role, argues Brown, that music can play in coalition-building. “Rock ‘n’ roll has always existed as a force in opposition to oppression,” he says. “it’s the prime artistic medium for the celebration of rebellion. It’s also obviously helped a lot of freak communities find people that they can talk to and be themselves around.”He acknowledges that such thinking has its pitfalls—pointing to the Maysles brothers’ documentary  Gimme Shelter, which documents the Rolling Stones show at Altamont, where the Hell’s Angels working security stabbed a fan to death. “The entire veil gets drawn up on everyone in an instant,” he says. “All their faith vanishes revealing this massive violent void. That seems like a pretty good lesson everyone learned. I don’t think rock music really fits into the process of building a better world, especially now where it’s such a niche thing. Rock music can fall prey to the downfalls of ineffective activism, attempting to take on the man but existing in your own dream horizontal world, essentially removing yourself from the problem.” Brown’s conflicted about the whole enterprise obviously, but its value is apparent on songs like “Deadlock,” the record’s closing track, which is premiering here today. Over oozing guitar leads, Brown’s able to turn the record’s whole theme into a sing-songy chorus, underlining, perhaps the absurdity of the whole exercise, the perversity of reveling in hopelessness, the understanding of how little such personal apocalypsis actually matters in the face of structural evil. The strange thing is, it’s fun too. However clouded, however ugly the state of things that Brown describes is there’s this irrepressible nature to the songs—an energy meant to make kids pogo endlessly in the smelly back rooms of crowded bars. This makes sense; no matter how much of a downer all this stuff can be, you just have to move forward. Brown does somehow. “I gotta give it to humanity,” he says. “We can have a good time no matter how fucked up the world is.“ Institute tour dates:May 18 - NYC @ Saint Vitus (Record Release Show)May 20 - Antwerp @ Antwerp Music CityMay 21 - Amsterdam @ Skatepark NOORDMay 22 - Copenhagen @ Korsgade 30May 24 - Berlin @ An der Autobahn (Bei Ruth)May 25 - Prague @ Klub 007May 26 - Vienna @ EKHMay 27 - Budapest @ AuroraMay 28 - Zagreb @ Club MočvaraMay 29 - Venice @ TBAMay 30 - Milan @ Casa GoriziaMay 31 - Lyon @ GZJune 1 - Barcelona @ MeteoroJune 2 - Madrid @ Wulritzer BallroomJune 3 - Bilbao @ El MuelleJune 4 - Getaria @ GaztetxeJune 5 - Paris @ L'InternationalJune 7 - Leeds @ Temple of BoomJune 8 - London @ New River StudiosJune 22 - Los Angeles @ ZebulonSign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Institute', 'Institute', 'Brown’s', 'Institute', 'Brown', 'Gimme Shelter', 'Rolling Stones', 'Altamont', 'Brown’s', 'Brown’s', 'Brown', 'Brown']"
"Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images We are in the midst of the dawning of a new age of yeehaw and Diplo will be damned if he's not going to get himself a piece of the action. The producer born Thomas Wesley Pentz has apparently noticed the tumbleweeds rolling across the great plains of culture and decided to start wearing Stetson hats, tweeting ""howdy,"" and playing country music festivals. Not that I would ever question Diplo's country music bonafides—the man was born in Mississippi, after all—the timing's just funny, you know. Last week, he released a song under his given name—one of those typical back to your roots moves—with the country singer Cam. The promo videos for the track featured Diplo cracking beers and palling around with horses on a farm. It's all a bit on the nose but it did result in the neologism ""#yeehouse,"" which essentially seems to mean the sort of MOR dance-pop Diplo's been doing on his own over the last half-decade or so with a sorta twangy vocal on top. It's simple and nice, even if it feels a bit calculated. Yeehouse gets its second track today with a new remix of the biggest song in the country, Lil Nas X's ""Old Town Road."" It's a pretty basic flip. The instrumental sections get stretched out a bit and a loping breakbeat gets added, turning it into a sorta quasi trip-hop thing, which I guess is the Diplo twist at this point. It's nothing unexpected, but it's cool and it gives all the big EDM dudes a way to drop this on festival main stages without throwing off the flow too much. Songs seem to rarely get to No. 1 these days without Diplo taking it for his purposes in some way. So in some ways this whole thing feels inevitable, but it's still impressive how much he was able to get on the ground floor here. At this weekend's Stagecoach Festival, Diplo brought out Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus for the first-ever live performance in the song. It was momentous occasion in the middle of a Diplo set at a country music festival, a string of words that only could have been made possible by people on Twitter pushing the yeehaw agenda.

"Photo by Jumei YamadaFormed in 2009 at Kyoto University’s music club, the four-piece Otoboke Beaver has been carving at the edges of confrontational punk across three albums and a handful of EPs and singles.  ITEKOMA HITS, their fourth, feels like the best encapsulation of their uncompromising vision; it’s as unhinged as it is unpredictable. Taking already-released songs from 2016’s  Bakuro Book EP, their 2017  Love Is Short EP, their 2018 single “anata watashi daita ato yome no meshi,” plus seven new tracks, the 14-song LP broadcasts what makes the band great by being loud, in-your-face, and deliriously fun. Though half of these songs have already been out in previous Otoboke Beaver releases,  ITEKOMA HITS boasts unexpectedly seamless sequencing. All of the tracks, which come in well under a half hour in total, soar with the same unnerving energy thanks to the pummeling rhythm section of bassist Hirochan and drummer Kahokiss, and the breathless vocal performance from singer/guitarist Accorinrin. She thrives on repetition and has her band back her up with screaming gang vocals like on “6 day work week is a pain” where she sings in Japanese, “Working 6 days a week is not good, no good / Working 6 days a week is no good. Can’t stand it. / Working 6 days a week is not good, no good.” It captures the mind-numbing mundanity of an office job perfectly. Elsewhere, the especially ferocious “I’m tired of your repeating story” Accorinrin seethes in rage, “I’ve heard it, heard it, heard it, heard it, heard it, heard it” before launching into a curdling scream mid-song. Like all of these tracks, it’s a lot to take in a single sitting but it’s also very cathartic like all good punk music. In a statement, Accorinrin explained the LP to Noisey, writing via a translator: “Our aim was, if someone were to ask, ‘What should I listen to?’ I want an indecisive person to be able to choose it without hesitation. We named it ‘Hits’ in that sense. ‘itekoma’ means to beat, to hit etc. and I think it suits how we’ve progressed as a band.” Stream it below and preorder the whole thing here.

"Photo by Larry Busacca/PW18/GettyImages for Parkwood EntertainmentBeyoncé has managed to make April feel like Christmas. Last week, she released HOMECOMING, a two-hour Netflix special detailing last year's historic Coachella performance, along with a 40-track live album of the performance. When you wonder how the storied singer will outdo herself, she exceeds all expectations. Just last year, Beyoncé bragged about Lemonade's TIDAL exclusivity on her joint album with Jay-Z, Everything is Love. ""If I gave two fucks about streaming numbers / Would've put Lemonade up on Spotify,"" she sang on ""NICE."" Luckily for us, she's changed her tune. Lemonade is available on streaming services for the first time since it's release three years ago—and it ends with a new (but, technically old) version of ""Sorry."" We'd gotten used to the version of ""Sorry"" we thought we knew. It quickly became an anthemic for the way it discarded a failed relationship with swagger and vulgarity. Did we think we'd ever see the day when Beyoncé sang ""Suck on my balls, pause?"" Absolutely not. The tempo was one you grooved to, but that didn't stop Serena Williams from twerking in her crown in the music video. The song's playful demeanor could be internalized as one of false threats, but Bey makes it clear that she means business by the end of the song. ""I left a note in the hallway, by the time you read it I'll be far away,"" she says over the deconstructed beat. This version felt perfect and because it made the original release of Lemonade, it probably is. Beyoncé, however, was kind enough to share her rough draft with us. The original demo begins the way the popular version of the song ends. ""Big homie better hold up,"" she sings, establishing this cadence for the first half of the song. The lyrics are largely unchanged, except this line: ""Young woadies 'bout to roll up, my woadies 'bout to stroll up / They coming through the back door,"" she sings. She's gone from ""sneaking out the back door"" to flee a failing relationship to using that same vantage point to allow her entourage to enter menacingly. The verses that follow a breathy declaration of wanting to live young, wild, and free underscore parts of The Carters relationship we'd heard elsewhere. ""Hell no, I ain't gon call you back / Chase me round the world, just to fall back,"" she sings, which mirrors Jay's bar about chasing his wife through Europe on 4:44. ""Sorry""'s original demo was already good, but knowing she took the time to perfect it makes it even better. It makes you wonder though, what other perfectly good demos she been sitting on?

"Image via YouTubeTaylor Swift's new video for ""ME!"" opens with a pastel-colored snake evaporating into whimsical little butterflies. It's a bit on the nose for the narrative she's trying to sell fans: that she's shed the vindictive vibe that marked previous album, Reputation, and she's moved onto nicer, prettier things. Namely, herself. ""ME!,"" which features Brendon Urie of Panic! At the Disco Fame, is a self-empowerment anthem. Taylor has turned he focus away from revenge and is searching inward, celebrating Taylor just as she is. ""You can't spell awesome without me,"" she sings in a video that looks like it had the same set designer as Mary Poppins Returns. The pop star announced in a much-hyped interview with Robin Roberts during the NFL Draft Thursday night that the song and video would be released in midnight. ""'Me!' is a song about embracing your individuality and really celebrating it and owning it,"" Swift told Roberts. ""I think with a pop song we have the ability to get a melody stuck in people's heads, and I just want it to be one that makes them feel better about themselves.""The announcement was the culmination of a 13 day countdown, during which Swift dropped clues beckoning fans to guess what her Big Announcement may be. The internet, being the internet, ran wild with speculation. An announcement this big, during the draft, with a serious journalist like Roberts, well it couldn't just be new music. Could it? One long-standing theory was that Taylor was going to use the moment to come out as bisexual or reveal something else about her personal life. That wasn't the case. Some may have been disappointed that the big news wasn't something juicier or more revealing. But this is Taylor Swift we're talking about and large-scale event-style announcements are just what she does. How else did you expect her to debut her hard pivot from evil to Lisa Frank goes to college? She wasn't just going to just quietly drop a new single on streaming services and call it a day. The spectacle of it all is a little tiresome. And yet it's clear that she's good at it and her core fans eat it up. There is more coming, too. Swift is scheduled to appear on Good Morning America Friday where she has more ""surprises."" Fans speculate it's something big, something monumental. My guess? It's probably an album.

"There’s a lot of love flowing through New York’s freak scene right now. I’ve written a lot over the last few months about the community of outsiders and noiseniks who call themselves “mutants,” and the many experimentally minded electronic musicians who orbit around them. And still, every time I end up at a show that features a few of these acts, I’m taken aback by the sense there that everyone’s on the same page, united in this strange cathartic spirit—whether that’s in the form of blistering noise sets or slivered remixes of “Barbie Girl” (shoutout to Nurse, who fucked up the basement at the Brooklyn Bazaar with that a couple of weeks ago).The easiest way to get plugged in to this world, and to find the people who embody this communitarian spirit, is still through the blog/label/platform Sermon 3, run by an artist called The 83rd. He’s a giving booster of the scene, dedicated to the weirdos from all corners of the underground; in his coverage and promotions, he seems equally inclined to support rappers with dizzying flows, cybernetic folk artists, and straight-up noise shows. He’s clearly incredibly open-minded, which is part of what makes this whole thing work—there are people like him who are genuinely curious and want to support stuff just because it’s out of the ordinary. It’s because of this openness that we tapped The 83rd for this week’s Noisey Mix. I figured a man with his hand in that many pots would turn in a pretty wild set, and he really delivered—cramming 30 songs into 30 minutes, making hard and fast cuts from frenetic footwork and club tracks to totally blown-out raps to glitchy M.I.A. remixes and back again. It’s head-spinning, brilliant, and full of the sort of ascendant but fucked-up energy that his scene thrives on. As another window into this world, he’s also sharing a video for the untitled track off his recent EP  patricia, which features freaky footage of many of the major players of this mutant scene, including Eartheater (who’s featured on the song) as well as Dreamcrusher, Bonnie Baxter, MoMa Ready, Tommi Kelly and Danny Orlowski of Deli Girls, and a whole lot more. You can watch that above alongside the mix below and an interview with The 83rd, both about this project and a new initiative he’s undertaken with some other members of the scene to make nightlife a safer place for everyone.  Noisey: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting?  The 83rd: The  clerbbbb. Or getting ready for the clerrrrb, or atcho friend’s crib afta the clerrrrb. The whole time I was working on this mix I was imagining DJing it out. There's all different parts to my creative outlets—experimental solo work, recording/mix/master engineer, songwriting and production with major labels, etc.. But when someone asks me for a mix?! Shiiit, we ‘ bout to dance. You're bearing witness to what my identity as a DJ looks like. Was there any specific concept to the mix?The mix is a sonic document of the underground. From the past three years of curating Sermon 3 Recordings along with 15 years as a record producer, I've heard so many dope records, a lot of them extremely underexposed. It’s why I started Sermon 3, to give a platform to the hyper creative that weren't being covered on a mass level. So this is me taking all these dope records I've covered, released, playlisted, and just wish more people knew about, and being able to put them together in a mix, hopefully bringing them an even greater reach. Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?I got a top three.That rap section with BbyMutha to WIFIGAWD X TRiPP JONES back to Gangsta Boo… whew! I can’t stay still whenever that comes on. Something on a core level gets me hyped and moves me everytime.Pauli Cakes's acappella expression going into NEVE - “Hardcore Appeal.“ My god. Run that back when you get a chance. Dead beautiful. Those screams were very personal to Pauli, and I knew I definitely wanted to use them in the mix, but didn't want to force it. Then I accidentally sped up the NEVE hardcore record like 30 bpm and grabbed a mid-verse part of their song that sounded sick in conjunction with what Pauli was already was referring to in “VOYEUR FUCK SHIT,” and the rest is history. I know that moment was meant to be; it was drawn from the greater energy that connects me and Pauli on a core level, I believe.Lastly, VICEVRSA. Yo, so VICEVRSA is a talented rapper and is tearing up NYC on his own wave. But you ready for it? You ready... That's my nephew, man. Like, my blood, my sister's child, ya dig? The reason this was so special for me was that VICE never asks me to plug him, list him for anything, or feature him at Sermon 3. We're a supportive family and leave it on a genuine level, holing up at my mama's house on the holidays or my sister's whenever I can make it out to see her, and that's that.So fast forward to me digging out records for this mix. As I was listening to a lot of cuts I planned on using, I start to realize they ultimately just didn't have the energy I was looking for in this scenario.I decided to go to VICE's soundcloud page and re-listen a little deeper to some of his cuts. I WAS  blown away. His music, regardless of being my nephew or not, was knocking. I had to double check myself to make sure I wasn't being partial and stayed honest with what worked. And yep, not only did it work, but it took the whole energy of the mix to another level. VICEVRSA is a legitimate problem. He just happens to be my nephew. (I ain't never been so genuinely proud to click and drag audio files into an Ableton live session.) Is synesthesia a real thing? If so, what color is this mix?Of course! With this mix, it’s more like ever-changing objects. It’s all moving so quickly—each record has its own vibe and sparks different associations. Like for instance, with Dani Rev's hard techno “CAGEMATCH” record? I see this spiral[ing] nebulous object that keeps rotating and morphing in a user;s hand.Or Hatechild's “I blame u” conjures up long sharp needles pinning and jarring thru the air. There's textural layers and associative images and colors with each song. Tell me a bit about the video you’re releasing as well. The song has such a fractured energy, how did you try to capture that visually?The song reminds me of a dark dollhouse, jovially manic with a child-like frenzy. I was picturing kids bouncing up and down, playing amongst themselves, in a tinted, cavernous environment. To them, that's simply their environment, their daily standard. It may look darker, more fringe to others from the outside looking in, but to them, it’s simply where their community resides—it’s their home. I think it’s representative of me and the rest of the homies in New York's underground. A lot of normies don't understand [what] we operate on, the way we identify in a variety of fashions and lifestyle choices we choose to make. We understand musically, creative[ly] and communally, we're mutants, and we own that shit. We get it, we get each other, and we choose each other, which makes it the most special. Me, Alex (Eartheater) and one of the directors, Daniel Mangosing, (shoutout to Tomy), were brainstorming this concept for the video and thought,  why don't just ask the homies to all be in the dollhouse with us, literally? Cause we're all actually friends and connected IRL, it was only a few texts away, and within a week we all pulled up to Pauli and Marley's crib and shot this epic-ass music video as a community. To me, we're acting as a small representation as to what's happening in NYC right now... the top's off, the young, vibrant, experimental, DIY mutant gang-up energy is too real, too  powerful. There's hundreds of mutants, don't get it twisted—way more than made it in this video. We're just acting as a small portal into our world.  Since we last spoke, you and Pauli Cakes have been working on a  guide to safer nightlife spaces . Can you tell me generally about that project?For too long, music, art, and nightlife industries have profited off the culture of POC, queer, and trans people while not actually prioritizing them; instead, using their lifestyle as a buzzword for more money, clout, and opportunity for their own personal gain. The culture creators, content curators; the musicians, artists, dancers; the black, gay, femme, punk and queer, are taking back what is owed to us by developing our own community spaces and digital platforms where we can excel and be exposed, not exploited. Our heart isn’t just for our personal spaces to have transparency and a revolution within them, but for a culture of respect, safety, and community to transcend established clubs, venues, and the art industry as a whole. Pauli Cakes had a revolutionary idea, and then Sermon 3 Recordings came on board to collaborate with them. It’s an editable community Word document that rewrites the rules of nightlife and our expectations for one another. This Securing Nightlife Info Exchange is an open-documented declaration for how we will run our DIY platforms and how we want established venues to run their spaces if they want us involved. Club kids, performing talent, and the community in general have an opportunity to write down what they want to see changed and enacted in the spaces they inhabit. It’s still open to collab now. Reach out to me, or Pauli or She Marley Marl of Discakes, and we'll send you the link if you wanna help shape policy in NYC nightlife and community spaces.  This is maybe self-evident, but can you talk about the ways that having safe nightlife spaces contributes to the health of the community at large?Yeah. If we feel safer, more respected and appreciated, everything changes. The output, the work, the art, the expression, the conversations all change. They become healthier, more inclusive—the one thing I’ve learned is mob mentality is real. So if that mob mentality is toward equality, social equity, and respect for all and is prioritized, watch how that sentiment snowballs. And watch those that come after us only be able to be bigger, stronger, more tolerant, and [more] loving; have a greater reach; and do more because of it.

"A version of this article originally appeared on Noisey China. After debuting on Howie Lee's music label Do Hits with his EP  Black Dragon in 2017, Shanghai-based producer Alex Wang has continued to explore his unique futuristic club sound, which shows traces of nu-metal, black metal, and sci-fi influences. His new EP 0% pushes past the artist boundaries of his contemporaries, offering a violent narrative influenced by the likes of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World.The track is a hybrid of various textures, ranging from club beats, synths and distorted vocals. In addition to Wang's current home of Shanghai, it's a commentary on the societal shift to modernity and urbanization worldwide. 0% is meant to describe the tipping point that prompts new personal beginnings: in this instance, a lack of hope and the illusion of ""zero"" flaws in a ""utopian"" world. WATCH: Self Portrait: Cardi BDirected by Chinese 3D artist Chillchill, the video for ""A Brave New World"" is a harrowing, apocalyptic depiction of present day China: an imagined look at the end result of rapid urbanization and the detrimental effect that had on the country's working class and migrant workers, or “the low-end population.” Programs like “bicycle-sharing”—often seen as examples of failed government regulation that only add to the degradation of urban environments—come under fire as well.

" Back when Ezra Koenig first shared details of Vampire Weekend’s upcoming fourth album  Father of the Bride, he revealed that the band would be releasing two songs from the LP each month before the its May 3 release. After two-track drops in February (“Harmony Hall” and “2021”) and March (“Sunflower” and “Big Blue”), the final pair of singles hit the internet this morning called “This Life” and “Unbearably White.” The first track, “This Life,” might be the most sonically upbeat of the six previews of the forthcoming 18-song album so far. While the song’s got a peppy and prominent guitar riff, the song’s lyrical content is hardly sunny. At one point, Koenig signs, “Oh Christ, am I good for nothing?” It was co-produced by Koenig and Ariel Rechtshaid, features a wealth of collaborators like backing vocals from Danielle Haim, guitar from Koenig’s Beats 1 Time Crisis co-host Jake Longstreth, and production credits from Chromeo. As Pitchfork points out, Koenig interpolates lyrics from iLoveMakonnen’s “Tonight” when he sings, “You’ve been cheatin’ on, cheatin’ on me/I’ve been cheatin’ on, cheatin’ on you.” “Unbearably White,” the second single, is much more chill and moody. Featuring additional production from Grimes and Justin Bieber collaborator BloodPop. Here, Koenig sings, “There's an avalanche coming / Don't cover your eyes / Is what you thought you wanted.” Listen to both tracks below.

"Image via Kitty on BandcampThese days, “synth pop” has a bit of a bad name. In recent years, it's a genre tag that's started to suggest a certain amount of homogeneity: as a rule, you know to expect basic song structure, breathy female vocals, and maybe a music video where someone is lying down on some ruffled satin or velvet and looking vaguely tortured. Friday April 5, however, marked potential change. The date marked the release of the prolific musician and producer Kitty’s new album  ROSE GOLD, which, from front to back, uses synth pop as a diving board, inviting listeners to jump into its lush, unique world. In 2018, we saw Kitty as one half of The Pom-Poms, a duo she formed with her husband Sam Ray (their self-described genre: “cheerleading music”). Alongside Ray she is a member of the band American Pleasure Club, and has also been making music under her own name for over a decade—her last release was 2017’s woefully underrated Miami Garden Club. Kitty, therefore, is someone who seems to live and breathe music: for her, a synth-pop aesthetic simply forms a basis for experimentation; something to shape for her own means, rather than something she’s chasing and trying to jump aboard. After years in the business, she’s innately familiar with the level of craft it takes to engineer a pop song, and that serves ROSE GOLD enormously well. Its choruses run laps around your brain (listen to “medicine” once and try to forget it), and though throughout the album there are nods to pop, chillwave, emo, and hip-hop, all of these genres are brought together by a pervasively woozy, but cohesive synth sound. It’s testament to Kitty’s skill as a producer that she’s able to take this many generic references and formulate them into something that sounds both interesting and consistent (she is responsible for all of  ROSE GOLD’s production, though cites “a little help from sam ray here and there” on her Bandcamp page). As a result,  ROSE GOLD is a record of many faces—and they all make complete sense. Standout tracks include “strange magic,” which is grounded in a sultry, low groove reminiscent of Kylie Minogue’s “Slow” (this, I believe, is the highest possible compliment an electronic pop track can ever receive) and “kitty’s farm”—like if The 1975 had had the good sense to keep “The Man Who Married a Robot/Love Theme” instrumental only. At the tail end of the record, “the window” takes its cues from the sound of collaborators American Pleasure Club, and as a result it’s guitar-driven with a distinctive riff—but by the chorus, Kitty melts it down to a catchy, dreamy number which doesn’t feel at all out of place alongside the rest of the material. And even though there are many artists who are potentially alluded to on  ROSE GOLD (Uffie, early Pity Sex, Charli XCX’s more experimental work), this record feels like the most fully realised reflection of Kitty’s personal artistry: not a mirror, but a prism, through which many different angles can be seen at once. Compared with The Pom-Poms, and much of Kitty’s own last release  Miami Garden Club,  ROSE GOLD is a more laid-back listen. The opening track “counting all the starfish” in particular has a floaty feel—hearing it feels like the experience of being carried gently along the surface of water that glints in the morning light, easing us in to the rest of the album. Kitty’s technique for structure, highs and lows—evident on The Pom-Poms’ Noisey Mix as well as on this record—means that she never overdoes it, making sure to keep a foot hovering over the pedal at all times. One aspect where this is particularly well done is in the deployment of rap sections on the tracks. Kitty is a gifted rapper, but the rarity of rapped moments on  ROSE GOLD mean that the ones which  are here really shine, as Kitty’s sweet but clipped enunciation digs in like papercuts. And while  ROSE GOLD sees her singing more than ever, the lyrical talents she honed as a rapper are on full show: truthful, funny, and sometimes sad, her lines always feel as though they slot perfectly together, as they ride these lazily giddy beats into a sunset all of Kitty’s making. By putting the emphasis for her record on the “pop” part of “synth pop”—that is, on the aspect which takes the most honing and technical skill—Kitty has made something personal and accomplished, which feels like it totally enacts her vision.  ROSE GOLD, therefore, is the combined result of smart instincts, and hard work: two principles which anchor every great musician. Kitty has been one for a long minute now, but this is definitive proof.

The album features 14 top class tracks of smooth disco and leftfield pop with guest appearances from the likes of Future Classic’s Panama, David Harks, Niya Wells, Emma Brammer, and Anduze.The global success of his debut album “Panorama Pacifico” which propelled him across the globe has inspired both the album itself and its title, “Solar Nights”.“In recent years the world’s become smaller, a more interconnected place. It can be dark and cold here, with snow all around, and the next day I can be playing to people on a beach. Somewhere on the planet it’s always daytime or summer, but beyond that day and night just blend into each other these days,” Tim explains. “We have daytime discos so you can go and party while the sun is still high in the sky, and you can go and hit the gym at night. Be it day or night, Satin Jackets is your soundtrack.”We here at Discobelle can premiere a track of the album, the absolutely lovely, slow-burning and smoothly seductive dance-pop jam “Just Like You”.PS.

"In the early 2000’s, Los Angeles cultivated an underground hip-hop beat culture, where every budding producer were on the same wavelength, experimenting like mad scientists in laboratories, and producing their next instrumental masterpieces.  A community formed around these artists who crafted a lo-fi, gritty sound that warbled and hissed like worn cassette tapes and vinyl. Glitched effects, samples and loops—driven along by a minimal kick/snare/hat groove—were created and performed on the Roland SP-404 Sampler.   This video shares memories from Dibia$e, Flying Lotus and Ras G but barely scratches the surface of a scene that grew from the roots of Project Blowed, Sketchbook, Boombox and Low End Theory.

"Kiefer is a keyboardist first and foremost, taught to play the blues by his father practically before he could walk. He started producing his own beats at around age twelve, and eventually went on to study under renowned jazz guitarist Kenny Burrell at UCLA’s Jazz Studies program. There, he started to toy with the synergy between the jazz piano he studied and the beats he created outside of school. While his peers performed over live instrumentation, Kiefer produced electronic beats completely free from sampled melodic material or drum breaks. While Bridges remains true to his jazz and hip-hop roots, the release between full-lengths was an opportunity to take his sound in new directions. “My dad always told me any time you work on something, make it better than last time,” he says, “I want to approach things in a new and updated way.” No longer driven solely by Kiefer’s signature piano, several songs on Bridges incorporate new instruments, including a range of analogue synths. They also display a renewed emphasis on arrangements. Steering away from the improvisatory, beat-tape styles of songs on Kickinit Alone and Happysad, Kiefer focused on a structured approach to composition and more intricately orchestrated moments, giving the title its second meaning — the musical bridge. Kiefer will take this new material on the road throughout 2019 backed by a team of A-list jazz musicians including Jonah Levine (trombone, keys), Sam Gendel (alto), Andy McCauley (bass), and Will Logan (drums). The dates include a US leg in April followed by Kiefer’s first solo European headlining tour in May. Put simply, Kiefer hopes his music and live shows can help inspire joy. “It’s comforting to see someone who is truly dedicated to making beautiful stuff,” he says, “I want people to see someone genuinely pour their heart into something.” ",articles24,"['Kiefer', 'Kenny Burrell', 'Happysad', 'Kiefer', 'Jonah Levine', 'Sam Gendel (']"

"Eight tracks seemingly meant for my ears as I commute from Ontario, California to San Francisco today, Overcast is aptly titled as I peer out my window seat to see white fluffy clouds scattered just below 30,000 ft. Nseven‘s Overcast is my soundtrack on this short 1-hr flight. The title-track loops in a fluid ambient shuffle while a microcosm of electronics and delicate piano keys flutter in the background—the mood is set for what’s ahead. “Memory Lane” does just what you might expect, providing nostalgic synthesizer-based rhythms and lively drums interspersed with sweet melodic sequences. And that’s what can be found at the center of Overcast, Nseven’s ability to create warm, engaged, and moving soundscapes is without question. A prime example is “Ben Nevis Landing,” where glitchy elements coalesce with tangled beats and organic notes dancing in the breeze not unlike what port-royal, Ulrich Schnauss, and Xurba would offer. Gliding through ambient-electronica quarters, the short runtime of “Stranger” leaves the listener wanting just that little bit more as the elusive Russian artist eases into a drone-laden stream of drifting subconsciousness. Highlights like “Stark” and “Walks” generate enough gravitational pull to keep the listener tuned into its gorgeous downtempo groove, in all making for a splendid trip with very little turbulence (quite literally.) And as a sidenote, it remains overcast for almost the entire 420-mile flight—how appropriate!Overcast is available as a Self-Released album.Overcast by Nseven",articles20,['Highlights']
"The new Expanse EP (available in April 2019) by friendly collaborators Stormfield (Combat operator) and Nonima (Section 27 operator) comes across as very much alive. Its sonic boom and emotional tug on the heartstrings is inevitable while low-end thuds, synthesizer grooves, and downtempo extracts are a highlight in and of itself—with Combat Recordings unleashing the goods once again. If 2015’s collaboration on the Stratosphere EP—described as “A chaotic storm bringing disarray, noise and confusion and leaving more of the same in its wake,” then Expanse is a distant cousin. “Caesura” and its Part-2 alter-ego inhabit much the same space that Meat Beat Manifesto have recently on their Impossible Star album (Flexidisc, 2018)—staccato beats, bass, and blissful distortion abound. “Expanse Pt.2” is very much in tune with the original, its trove of rumbling echoes and underpinned ambient-electronic stream is a sweet foray in the darkness. On the industrial-acid warble of “Airlock,” fractured percussive bits ricochet off a glass floor while a caustic bass-line drives the entire piece. The epic, 12-minute “Void” describes its sonic siblings in a summarized viewpoint—magnetized acidic rhythms glide around shuffling beats in an inescapable dystopian landscape. Igloo recently had an opportunity to ask the duo a few questions regarding the Expanse EP, their influences, continued collaboration, and what’s in the pipeline.Igloo :: Tell us a little more about the process, how did the Expanse EP come together?Nonima :: The title-track was initially started by Stormfield as a submission for a Sci-Fi documentary piece which didn’t happen—the music sat on a hard drive for a while and sent it over to me to rework over winter after finishing up on a remix I’d been putting together for his other project (Scald) at the end of 2018. We’d discussed sending a few stems back and forth and see what comes out of it and a handful of tunes were completed within that few weeks (most of) which became the framework of this new EP.Stormfield :: It’s the first time I’d tried doing something specifically for that sort of brief, with a “complete” melodic narrative establishing the riff, then taking it up, sideways and down in three minutes. The documentary never happened for whatever reason, so the track sat on the hard drive (as Nonima mentioned) for a couple of years while I got busy with other stuff (doing audio for Scald, visuals for Mick Harris, and African Head Charge). I did so much visual work in 2018 that some new people went “…oh you do music as well?” Haha. So, over last Christmas (2018) I had 10-days off to hibernate in the warehouse, and by some lucky timing a friend lent me his Elektron Digitone which I sampled the fuck out of. Before we knew it, a pile of nice stems got recorded, which we swapped back and forth. Quite quickly, five new tracks took shape and we thought why not make an EP? We’re across London / Glasgow-ish, but it’s quite easy to collaborate online with the same version of Ableton, rendering stems to audio as needed.Igloo :: What are your influences, and what drives/motivates the dark-electronic rhythms you are both aptly chasing?Nonima :: Sharing a common ground of appreciation for various sounds and styles while having very different backgrounds of experience I’d say. Another person working with you helps the workflow change up a little bit differently than it would producing on your own. The drive comes from just making tunes for yourself and your network of friends to listen to, some of those eventually get shared more widely online.Stormfield :: There’s quite a lot of overlap in the electronic influences. On this side, relevant to the release would be 1990’s-era Speedy J, The Future Sound of London, Autechre, Brothomstates, Balil (Plaid) and EOG. When on my own, I tend to make acidy broken rhythms, which, in avoiding the four-on-the-floor, tend to end up sounding electro-ish even though it’s not the intention; rather I gravitate toward anything broken and bassy.As for dark… Well, it’s partly venting. I try to survive and still be creative while living in a stressful city, it’s been a precarious existence for as long as since I’ve moved here, plus on top of that watching the whole country go down the toilet. Combine that with shit weather and a need to block the surroundings out, sounds are a good way to vent. The sounds fit the pressure of the surroundings. Oh, and a twisted gallows humor helps as well. Either that, or a punching bag. But with making music at least it leads to gigs, seeing places and meeting nice people.Igloo :: The duo of Stormfield & Nonima have collaborated previously, have you thought about forming a duo and continuing the collaboration?Nonima :: Well we first crossed paths on 2013’s remix for Stormfield’s Collapsing System release on Combat and there’s been a steady stream of remixes or tracks for various compilations and labels up to this point, including 2015’s Stratosphere EP. Our working pace harmonizes when it comes to projects and I always enjoy the process of working on stuff so no doubt there’s more in the pipeline, such as a remix for Scald that’s forthcoming. He’s already doing stuff with Fausten and Scald so it might start to become a bit of a juggle, haha. 
Stormfield :: Most likely; there’s a lot of overlap musically so why not? Although it may be easier to use a different, shorter name for the duo! :)Igloo :: Expanse has a dark, dystopian groove to it, and yet it all comes together seamlessly via acidic noises, bleeps, and mechanical beatwork. How would you describe the mood of this EP, or was there a specific theme you were aiming for?Nonima :: Not so much at the start but after we had “Expanse” and “Void” down we had the idea of aiming towards a 4 or 5 track EP framework, keep the sessions more focused otherwise quite easily it would have become a full-length release. The loose concept materialized on its own from the vibe of those tracks, and the cover art sort of tied into all of that. I like to think of these things more as a happy accident.Stormfield :: The original brief for the film was Sci Fi Horror (whatever that means). It’s kinda dystopian (but not as dark as Fausten/Scald—didn’t want to scare them off! There’s still some feeling of hope in it. Maybe that’s why they rejected it, who knows. :)The 303 sounds all come from patterns saved from existing live sets (current Stormfield setup is the tt303, octatrack, volca kick+fm). Some of the patterns are in 3/4 which drift across the main rhythm, handy to keep things from becoming too loopy when I’m tweaking the other boxes at the same time, you only have two hands after all. The acid lines worked surprisingly well at a slower tempo on “Void.” Quite a lot of the fizzy metallic bleepy sounds come from the Digitone without too much processing. Looking back, maybe the other tracks subconsciously took shape in reaction to Expanse, they seem to fit around it theme-wise although this was not consciously intentional at the time.Igloo :: What’s next for the duo, any live shows, shout-outs, special notes you want to add for your audience?Stormfield :: There are a couple of Stormfield live shows coming up, organised by NFA (March, hybrid DJ/live set) and Crux (April, live). Two Scald Process AV shows also at Exploding Cinema and Towards Collapse (12th April). Been roped in to do visuals for a housemate’s band Grave Miasma at Netherlands Deathfest, and more African Headcharge stuff in spring/summer. Production-wise, more tracks! There’s a Stormfield remix of Mick Harris (as Fret) due on Combat / Opal Tapes in May, test pressings just landed today. I picked up my own Digitone last week so the pressure is on to use it properly and make more stuff, or else it’s just pointless gear-collecting, waste of money. I’ve also nearly completed a new albums worth of Scald Process (Scald is the violin noise electronic collaboration with Líam Noonan—we met while working at the Tate), will look for a label soon. Scald also remixed Mick Harris which’ll be on the same EP in May with remixes from Monster X, Fausten, and Stormfield. The second album from Fausten (collaboration with Monster X) is nearly done so we’ll be looking around labels soon. If you like something that takes strong influences form Scorn and Autechre, get in touch! ;)Nonima :: Probably new Mitoma stuff later in the year, a couple of currently unreleased remixes for friends to be released at some point. Also my Section 27 imprint turns 10 this year so there will be an anniversary compilation release in the works for that probably around June.Thanks for the positive feedback on this release so far: Truss, The Advent, Boris Brenecki, Parallax, Death Qualia, Afrodeutsche, Hesska, Mick Harris, Graeme Mclean, Boycey, Subsekt Blog, Skirmish Blog, and Igloo Mag of course!

"[Press-Release] The high cube drifter watches from a cliff overlooking the remains of a broken world. The high cube drifter commands nothing but the clothes on their back and a handful of dust. The high cube drifter remembers a time when everything was permissible but nothing was free. The high cube drifter lives in a world where nothing is available and the only freedom is far away. The high cube drifter sifts through the artifacts and debris of a world they realized was their domain but only when it was too late. The high cube drifter wakes up to oily, smokey sunrises and goes to sleep after lurid, vibrant sunsets. The high cube drifter wonders what this world is coming to day after day, collapse after collapse.” ~CRTHigh Cube Drifter (M-Tronic, 2019) is the album Cathode Ray Tube (aka CRT, aka Charles Terhune) almost didn’t get to make. “I was nearly killed in a car accident in the summer of 2018,” says CRT. “They hit me on the driver’s side which spun us out then rolled the car three times. When it stopped, and I knew my daughter (and my dog) were safe, I realized it wasn’t my life that had flashed before my eyes. Instead, I saw images of everything I’ve yet to accomplish. One of these was making more music that comes closer to what I hear in my mind. I walked away from the accident but the lessons I learned from it stay with me. I’m lucky to be alive and even luckier to be able to continue to do the things I love, one of which is make music.”High Cube Drifter, CRT’s first album of 2019, is the story of survival in a post-collapse world where technology exists in fits and starts while humanity struggles to not just move on but to get by and survive. “Every age has proclaimed apocalypse was on their doorstep, arriving tomorrow and delivered for free,” says Charles Terhune. “And every age of humanity has felt it was imminent. With weapons of mass destruction at their most powerful and so-called leaders of the free world at their most unhinged, however, this truly feels more imminent than ever. I want to be hopeful but a certain 45th president of the world sets my teeth on edge whenever he speaks and makes my heart stop when I think he’s got the big red nuclear button inches away from his tiny, Diet Coke shriveled, syphilitic finger at all times.”Despite the dire tone expressed therein, CRT continues to progress and evolve in his music, making the most of whatever time he has left on this earth. The music on High Cube Drifter varies between dark, somber dirges which morph into uplifting semi-rave anthems to glitch-battered, FM-synthesized synth nerd jams that transform into sonic elegies to a higher power. “Good Morning” lopes into being, opening the album with swirling synth pads before taking the listener into a deep dark hole of repetitive beats and ever-morphing bass. “Flying Zero” is a narcotic, futuristic dub adventure, the score to the Wintermute heist scene in the imaginary “Neuromancer” movie were it composed by Sly & Robbie working with Autechre. “Kicking Sides” is yet another dub-drenched exploration of the furthest reaches of sound, perhaps unconsciously nodding at CRT’s alter-ego The Dubtologist wherein he takes a stricter approach to dub influenced electronics. “AOC” is both a paean to CRT’s younger days dabbling in the 90’s rave scene of New York city and a nod to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the NYC Congresswoman wreaking havoc on the patriarchy. “Spite House” is an arpeggiated masterpiece of deft electronics and melody with beats driving the point home.“There’s fear in the world and obviously I’ve got the fear, too,” says CRT in a humorous nod to his heroes Meat Beat Manifesto. “But as the author Nick Harkaway says we’ve got to weaponize that fear and weaponize our dissent. And my weapons are music and words. And I’ve got hope, too. Despite it all, be it the accident or the dingle-Cheetoe in the White House, I still have hope. I’m just grateful I can make music as often as I can. Without it there’d be no hope. And without hope there is no art, no civilization, no humanity nor any chance of evolution.”High Cube Drifter is available on M-Tronic.High Cube Drifter by Cathode Ray Tube",articles20,"['Charles Terhune', 'Charles Terhune', 'High Cube Drifter', 'Wintermute', 'Sly & Robbie', 'Autechre', 'The Dubtologist', 'Cathode Ray Tube']"
"Giving praise to some of the giants of electronic music, De:Tuned is once again hitting the shelves of respectable record stores. This third EP of ten gathers four musicians who have been active since the first rumblings of techno, a quartet with more than one hundred years’ experience between them.Introducing this latest 12” are two modern cuts. First up is a true sonic sculptor. Michigan’s John Beltran has been active twenty-five years, shaping his sound on seminal labels like Peacefrog, R&S and Delsin. “Juliette” is the sweetened offering from this seasoned Detroiter, and, in spite of his home town heritage and this being a contemporary creation, the influences come straight from the UK. Bulging basslines are tethered to skittering drum patterns, a foundation from which silken strings soar in a cheerful interlude that immediately brings to mind early musings from The Black Dog. Since 1986 Mark Archer has been corrupting minds and filling floors. Under a dizzying number of pseudonyms Archer roasted speakers with rave anthems, most famously as part of the dust mask clad Altern 8. Archer’s “Depth From Within” is a far cry from those glow stick days with the pioneer instead opting for the path laid by Beltran. While beats have been bolstered with a steady kick and fuller claps, those same dreaming synthlines are just as central. The flip is turns the clock back with a prolific producer: Future Beat Alliance. Rich tones and meandering melodies characterise “Reflected Notes,” a piece made in the early 90s. Flowing keys slip and slide over one another, rising and falling against a rhythmic patchwork in a beautifully subtle work. Arguably the least known name of this compilation, Erwin Van Moll has been active since 1992 with the dutchman having graced seminal imprints like Eevo Lute Muzique and New Electronica under his max 404 pseudonym. “Butterflying” is taken from Van Moll’s earliest productions around ‘92, having been rediscovered on DAT tapes. The veteran of the European scene delivers a smooth and soulful piece with all the trappings of classic techno. Liquid notes squirm and squeal under warm bass and echoing toms, shimmering keys giving texture to the backdrop of this absorbing closer.De:Tuned’s ten year journey takes a new path with this latest. The depth of expression and intimacy of 10.3 is founded in the emotive machine music of the 1990s. Through four masters who lived through those formative days, fours trailblazers who continue to dive into the circuit boards to uncover new music, this compilation illustrates the essence of that sound. Through lost tracks, 10.3 revives the golden age of techno, it also reinvigorates it with modern productions as it demonstrates that, perhaps, this timeless age of music never ended, it was merely paused to be rediscovered.DE:10.03 is available on De:tuned.",articles20,"['De:Tuned', 'Detroiter', 'The Black Dog', 'Erwin Van Moll', 'Van Moll’s']"
"What more is there to say? The brief press paragraph for this powerful EP sums it up perfectly: “Yellow Machines is back after a 5 year break with a solid four track EP, two original tracks from ΠΕΡΑ ΣΤΑ ΟΡΗ or PERA STA ORI (Greeklish) and two completely reworked versions from Brenecki and ScanOne. For fans of Skam, Analogical Force, and Furthur Electronix, these tracks touch on distorted electro with early 90’s Sheffield techno references, bleeps, drones, and breaks. A solid all round EP for the braindance crew and raveheads.” What else would you expect? All four tracks literally grab the ears, heart, and feet with a vengeance.The first piece is culled from Numb Capsule’s 2017 Fragments compilation titled “Kato Apo To Dentro”—a rapid-fire broken-beat and bass smorgasbord that is packed to the brim with high-energy mechanical rhythms and crashing melodies. Elsewhere ΠΕΡΑ ΣΤΑ ΟΡΗ invites Yellow Machines label head (ScanOne) to tear apart “Gone Beautiful,” a fierce slice of life that brings together classic abstract breaks with early Tri-Repetae-era (Autechre) beats that eventually transform into a visceral onslaught. Brenecki takes “Gone Beautiful” and adds an emotional spin to it—industrial-IDM, loosely drifting synthesizer tones busted up by a crunchy percussive grooves. The original “Gone Beautiful,” perhaps an ode to early 90’s Artificial Intelligence-era finesse is carefully maneuvered with ricocheting dark-electro strands that fans of the above-mentioned imprints should take notice of.A highly recommended extended player for abandoned buildings, dystopian landscapes, and intense armchair listening sessions creating a nostalgic sonic reawakening with a punch.Iskios is available on Yellow Machines.YM015_PERA STA ORI_ISKIOS EP by YELLOW MACHINES  (label)",articles20,"['Skam', 'Furthur Electronix', 'Numb Capsule', 'Yellow Machines', 'Iskios']"
"Netherlands-based Jeroen Bax (aka exm) might be a recognized name on the Touched Music imprint and many self-releases, but he’s also just release a mind-boggling extended player for Germany’s Kaer’Uiks available as cassette and digital. As one of IDM’s leaders in the abstract-electronic arena, exm continues in his mission extract every possibly sound from his arsenal.With two tracks spanning over 15-minutes each, Bax creates vast, expansive, and utterly engaging worlds filled to the brim with magnetically charged rhythms that clatter and break apart. Not unlike what most have come to expect from Booth’n Brown, exm creates captivating soundscapes made from a plethora of organic, almost lifelike structures that transform over time.The title-track expands and contracts with disjointed and meandering melodies that eventually taper into noisier, glitch-infested mayhem in its final minutes—an evolving trip from start to finish. “19451663,” on the other hand, runs rampant with cascading modular blips and bleeps that rip apart to showcase its skittering electrical beauty. And this is what makes exm’s style so compelling—his use of wide-open spaces allows each sonic element to build off the last as his audience loses track of time in a surreal and vibrant audio manifest.01411635 is available on Kaer’Uiks.01411635 by exm",articles20,[]
"There are certain artists who seem to consistently deliver the goods, musicians who constantly drive their machines into the ground, and the red, to create their own brand of brazen debauchery. DimDJ (aka Dimitris Evagelopoulos), is one of them. With releases on Lower Parts, Mathematics and TH ± Tar Hallow, the Thessaloniki producer returns to his home-based label of June Records.Seven tracks make up this mini-album, his second on the Greek imprint. A rumbling sequence of arpeggios introduces “9th of May.” Acid are folded in with a dollop of distortion to bend the steady kick and burrowing claps. Whimsy arrives with the cascading notes of “1992.” Cut in the traditions of house, the track bubbles and simmers with a contained energy that never boils over. Although the tools of Guilty Pleasure and the split EP on Endless Illusion are being employed, for Recurring Patterns they have been utilised to a different effect. Much of the rawness, the jagged edges and serration has been filleted and rounded off. “Acid.FM” is a perfect example of this where melodies are allowed to simply meander and find their own way. Rust is poured on to the proceedings on the flip. “Bold” refuses to sit still, fidgeting and shifting from one angular turn to another. Once again the machines are set spinning with the whirling grit of “White Lodge.” The outlier of the LP is also its apex of natural progression. “Jazz Radio” is the most abstract and understated of the proceedings, loops and squeal tethered to a lone 4/4 beat as DimDJ strips back all to a reduced essence.Recurring Patterns sees Evagelopoulos pare back the aggression of some of his previous productions, yet that unrefined quality remains. Nevertheless, the intensity with which he has created his compositions is ever present. Rather than a shift in style, this album is new step in the DimDJ sound.Recurring Patterns is available on June.Recurring Patterns by DimDJ",articles20,"['DimDJ', 'Guilty Pleasure', 'DimDJ', 'DimDJ', 'DimDJ']"
"Just what would you expect from two prolific producers in the far-reaching experimental electronic space? Kero and Valance Drakes join forces (for the first time) to create Abstract Thought, a 7″ and digital EP released on Record Store Day (4/12/2019). Now what’s in the basket, you ask?Starting with a low center-of-gravity on “Can’t edit your soul,” this piece inhabits an outer dimension made from glitch-drone strands, reversed loops, and a dystopian world of drifting dust particles. Next up is the impacted data stream of “Centered Around Space Invader Attributes” where electronic hip-hop elements maneuver through shuffling bass and eroded blips. Similar cascading dark glitch echoes evaporate on the contagious “Radius Radiant Andromeda” where shadows are cast from all angles. Closing with the lengthiest track (at 4:30), “When one hopes become your compass” has its own disjointedly sweet ebb and flow.Capturing the above-mentioned notes and tossing them in mechanical sound chamber, both Kero and Valance Drakes exhibit highly detailed extraterrestrial electronics, merging glitch-hop and surreal atmospherics into a visual-audio four-pack kaleidoscope.

"The club can be a strange environment. One moment you are a coal mine with a mirrorball and strobe lights, the next it is the most inviting, friendly faces and comradery in every corner. It was during the latter that I met Zorz, DJ, member of Pi Electronics and all round music aficionado.DJ Sneaker was playing here in Madrid and I bumped into lover of all things electronic and, as luck would have it, I had just done an interview with a very good friend of his, the boss of Pi Electronics.Luck will have it that Zorz not only shared an astoundingly similar taste in music to Robbie and Chris, he also lived a stone’s throw away in Robbie’s barrio. Since then some cracking days, nights and mornings have been enjoyed together including a recent session for WE FORFEIT to try their luck on Zorz’s Creatures of the Night show hosted on Madrid’s very own. Although we were all fairly bleary eyed after being out the night before at Ultradyne, we dusted ourselves down, ironed the shirts and made our way to the studio off Calle Atocha.The two hour set is opened by the host. Faced with a pair of turntables, CDJs and a rotary mixer, Zorz effortlessly makes his way through a spread of styles. Rich textured ambience, soulful techno, toughened EBM and otherworldly trips. Tracks come from far and wide including Crystal Maze on aDepth Audio, fellow countryman DimDj and the Mannequin mastermind Alessandro Adriani.Robbie is up for the next forty five minutes. Homage is paid to many of the artists who have played in Madrid in the last two months (and there has been an incredible amount of quality on offer.) Ultradyne, Junq, Cignol, DMX Krew and Univac, all of whom graced the Spanish capital with sets between January and March are represented. Homegrown Iberian talent is well represented by Old Coroner (played at 45rpm to give it a bit of whack) on Waste Editions and Sweden’s Fishermen attacking their fellow countryman Celldöd on Madrid’s very own Femur. Darker moments come care of Tropical Goth’s Shredder while brighter spots from Bordello A Parigi’s always incandescent catalogue.Chris closes the proceedings with a bubbling stew of darkened electronics, future-gazing funk and industrial ooze. New talent melts with dusty gems as record shelves are plundered for this cracking set. Grisly techno comes care of Rise Black before the uplifting Reflective Souls and moody tones of Farron on Forbidden Planet. Metal glints in the steely productions of Betek and Jensen Interceptor with angular softened by the legendary Bitstream and deep currents of Hodge on Berceuse Heroique. Chris closes with some red blooded bangers and late night warehouse classics.Despite giving away a far bit in the above, we’ve decided not to provide a full tracklist (although we will on request.) ¡Enjoi!Thanks again to Zorz and the guys at Radio Relativa, muchísimas gracias!Download the mix!",articles20,"['Robbie’s', 'Madrid’s', 'Crystal Maze', 'Audio', 'DimDj', 'Homage', 'Madrid’s', 'Rise Black']"
"In the circle of musical publishers such as Polar Seas, Under the Spire, Rural Colors, and Home Normal—Whitelabrecs is one indie label based in Toronto and dedicated to sustained drone ambient music as well as post-minimalism, electronic downtempo, instrumental shoegazing pop and “hypnotic school” of sound experimentalism. Anthéne is the solo project of Bradley Sean Alexander Deschamps (curator of Polar Seas Recordings). Anthéne has been extremely prolific the past few years with a number of personal albums published by micro labels which operate under the DIY ethical, convivial, non-profit approach. The usual style defended by this project is centered on slowly moving ambient sceneries, in a subtle, delicate manner, playing with the suspension of time. This new album appeals to all fans of canonical ambient music and craft based drone music with touches of melodious pop impressionism. Asymmetry is an inspiring and easy listening album which reveals similar emotional experience to wistful, grey, calming and textured ambient wanders from Off The Sky, Eluvium, Hotel Neon, Jasper TX et al.Asymmetry is available on Whitelabrecs.asymmetry by anthéne",articles20,"['Under the Spire', 'Whitelabrecs', 'Asymmetry\xa0', 'Asymmetry']"
"Britain is generally credited with the rise of synth wave. Bands like Depeche Mode, OMD and The Human League broke the pop mould, employing freshly manufactured machines and openly commenting on the economic, political and social issues of the day. Despite the deserved fame of the above, other countries, and musicians, were also at the coalface of the avant-garde of this exciting period.Novostj formed in the early 1980s. Roberta and Massimo Ongaro, Danilo Beltrame and Marco Milanesio. The partnership soon began recording their own brand of introverted electronics, utilising the new equipment coming out of their Italian homeland alongside more traditional instruments. Between 1983 and 1984 they recorded a number of tracks in Turin’s Terminal Bliss, four of which have been selected by ACC founder and ResonanceFM broadcaster Flora Pitrolo alongside original band member Marco Milanesio.“Voce Di Edifici Vuoti” introduces the compilation. Reduced down to its raw core, refracted beats chug and scratch against an extended wall of bass with melodies skulking behind. “Nel Vuoto” follows. The heartwrenching distance of a Novostj contemporary, Vitrola, is immediately called to mind by this deeply emotive track. Clean percussion and broad guitar strings support distressed vocals in this seven minute romance laden lament. Experimentation is never far away with this collection, industrial distortion and haze filming the unsettling “La Voce” before the torturing shrieks of “Non Credi, Non Credi.”Flip over and the group have transformed into another beast, DsorDNE. This expanded outfit were far more prolific than their first incarnation with the group still releasing music to date. The songs chosen for 1983-1988 were made between ’87 and ’88. Their self-titled “DsorDNE (Versione Dal Vivo)” is wonderfully daring. Shaped as a piece of darkened wave, the musical journey suddenly veers off road as cymbals crash, drum machines splinter and vocals spiral wildly. “Trsisti Di Rabbia” is cut from the same sombre and soulful cloth of “Nel Vuoto.” Lyrics and synthlines cry to a stern rhythm in a work that is sensitive and extremely subtle. As with their first musical musings, the desire to toy with expectations and preconceptions is present. “Al Contrario” finishes and does so with psychological intent. Spoken word is accompanied by electronic pulsations in this estranging minimal synth close.1983-1988 gives a wide cross section of a group of Italian synth wave pioneers. Novostj adapted and adopted from the influences swirling around them, DsorDNE hardened that vision through greater experimentation as new machines developed. A wonderful introduction to an outfit whose music continues to challenge with its defiant cry.1983-1988 is available A Colder Consciousness/ACC.Novostj DsorDNE 1983-1988 by ACC Records",articles20,"['Depeche Mode', 'OMD', 'The Human League', 'Massimo Ongaro', 'Marco Milanesio', '”Flip', 'DsorDNE', 'DsorDNE', 'DsorDNE']"
"Facebook feeds can be a great leveller at times. Anyone reading this has probably encountered an advert of late. Why? You’re into electronic music and therefore fair game for such content. The content in question is Richie Hawtin’s F.U.S.E. anniversary box-set, a regal collection for a princely sum. But, as we all know, away from the sponsored ads, is where reality it to be found.It is from Mr. Hawtin’s M_nus platform that Exalt Records select their latest 12.” Although M_nus is best known for its minimal productions, during its lengthy existence the Canadian label has explored both the depths of this techno alongside many shallower moments. Thankfully Break In At Apartment 205 does not fall into the latter category. A collaboration between Swayzak and Theorem, the reissue chooses two out of the three tracks from the original 1999 EP. The title piece opens the wax and immediately addresses any prejudices regarding minimal techno. Elaboration is indeed stripped back, leaving a bare metronomic rhythm around which swirl a selection of subtle notes. Keys orbit in shifts, delaying, rising and fading as the track pulls you in deeper and deeper as it conjures images of distant nebula and star strew skies. “Bad Hair Day” follows in more determined fashion, a steady kick and hi-hat giving way to a rusted snare as gentle folds of sound begin to form. Slowly a melody begins to form, two notes here, three there, until the true complexity of the piece is unveiled, a dreamy and intimate work which, like its predecessor, is admirably understated.Arguably the social media age has narrowed our views, promoted the pigeonholing of views and the narrowing of ideas. Genres were there beforehand and did the same. Stereotypes existed before any of the above. Minimal techno suffered, and continues to do so, from being pegged as formulaic and even boring. This cannot be said for Break In At Apartment 205. This is music to sit back to, put the feet up and absorb—uncluttered compositions filled with gentle ebbs and flows that grow into emotive surges. Music from a simpler time, far from simple music.Break In At Apartment 205is available on Exalt.",articles20,"['Richie Hawtin', 'Elaboration', 'Stereotypes']"
"Clubbing in Madrid thankfully has little of the haughty exclusivity of other European capitals. As long as you look older than thirteen and can stand you’ll more than likely gain admission alongside a mixed drink of your choice. This usual ease of access was not the case when Egyptian Lover, aka Greg J. Broussard, recently played. No, bouncers of the Spanish capital had not suddenly developed Berghain ambitions; the electro turntablist had simply sold out, a rarity in these parts.I would not have guessed that “The Lover” had such a following in Spain, then again I would not have seen the Los Angeles-based producer collaborating with a contemporary masked master of machine funk; The Exaltics. Maybe I need work on my hunches.Three tracks are housed picture disc by Mehdi Rouchiche, Godspill creator and core artist of labels like Bunker, Crème Organization and Solar One Music. First up on this ghoulish mask is the ephemeral “Exodus,” a brief breathy prelude to the main courses on offer. “Exterminate” sets out in stall from the needle drop. Snapping snares are soon shouldered by juddering basslines before a hail of stabbing synthlines descend. Mean and moody, the track radiates malicious intent. Broken glass, barbed basslines and the glint of the knife with The Exaltics stalking the streets for their victim. The collaboration occupies the flip. “I Want You” combines steely mechanics with the unmistakable voice of Egyptian Lover. Despite the familiar structure of the verse, the overly confident advances of past pieces have been an accented aggression, a throaty threat turning every more menacing as lancing rhythm patterns give way to inhuman vocoder breaks.Exodus displays The Exaltics’ rawer side, the untamed and unrelenting perspective of Robert Witschakowski’s sound. The partnership with the legendary Broussard melds this harshness with electro-funk to produce a cold and futuristic image of the sound.

"Fans of poignant, personal and craft-based ambient soundscapes will be served with this new monthly batch of releases by the highly prolific Shimmering Moods Records (key DIY actor and publisher in the latest development of electronic/shoegaze/ post-minimalisn). Fishing For Shadows from the obscure No One provides a compelling collection of moodily introspective, detached and fragmented microtonal sceneries based on eerie experimental guitars, field recordings and submerged melodious lines. The whole thing suggests a vibrant, emotional and melancholic soundtrack for lonesome days. All instruments are heavily treated and processed, favoring electro-acoustic researches on raw sounds, pattern and motion. The music is structured as a long and expanded dusky ambient tale of austere and morose beauty.

"Up until now we’ve had to make do with the appearances that BLN has put out on compilations with Touched Music, and more recently on Neo Ouija’s fantastic Cottage Industries 8 collection. But no longer. Fresh from Romania, Victor Popescu supplies us with a well thought-out and creative approach to both production and sound design.The debut album Multiverse is a stunner opening with “Matter”—this one really gives off a Wendy Carlos/Rachel Elkind vibe and is reminiscent of the best 80s synth soundtracks to dystopian mini-series. The transition into “Gravity” is nice—a fade-in which is less common these days but quickly gets to the point. Drawing on the world of science for the naming of tracks, I have to frequently remind myself that I’m listening to produced and organised sound, rather than actually in some kind of experiment to test my perception of things. “Bosons” has a lovely chord progression, I feel its biggest strength are the background bell-like sound. Arguably the quietest part of the track, they really do hold it all together. “Tau” is a good working track, percussive and confident synth rhythms meld perfectly with gilde-driven pads and other goodness. “Dark Energy” almost feels as if exm has taken over for a short while, it’s certainly dark and definitely full of energy. And despite the almost-hectic pace and sinister backchannel twirling of “Muon,” this track really plays with me due to its comparative lack of high end. Things feel very muted up there and it gives a great space quality to things. Fantastic brain-food.The majority of the release is of a relatively relaxed and laid-back pace, with the second half a fantastic display of beeps, whooshes and harmonically-rich sound. And then there’s “Hadron.” Everything changes and words escape me. It’s got the 2nd beat strength that I love with dissonance all over the place. Getting progressively more hectic, its abrupt disappearance left me quite sad that it was over. Think “Flight of the Navigator” but with evil intentions (what an awesome film that would have been). Things are wrapped up with “Dust,” which is where we all end up in the end anyway. It’s a strong outro and one befitting of this release. We even get a remix from veteran ambient producer Arovane to polish things off.Multiverse is available on Touched Music.Multiverse by BLN",articles20,"['Drawing', 'Arovane', 'Multiverse']"
"For those of you unfamiliar with RX-101, he has been quietly releasing one after another gems of classic 90s styled IDM on Suction for a while now. If you have been listening to Brainwaltzera, or Skee Mask, this record sits well in a mix with either of those. In many ways elements of Dopamine recall to mind Aphex Twin, Boards Of Canada, and other classic IDM music, but again, it has its own unique vibe. Where Aphex Twin is a bit weird and wild, RX-101 is a very relaxed, straight-laced kind of affair. It’s wonderful, relaxing, upbeat music with lush melodies and engaging sounds.The Aphex Twin comparison is inevitable given the stylistic era, sounds, and masterful songwriting used on the Dopamine, but I would liken this to DMX Krew and Ceephax school of happy, innocent, and fun tracks versus the darker more introspective stylings of Brainwaltzera, AFX, and BoC et al. Label mates D’Arcangelo would also be a good comparison.One can’t help but feel the dust on these old tracks, somehow this could only have come from a series of tracks dug out of a dusty bin from decades ago (or, in this case, Soundcloud), it’s absolutely spot-on peak-era IDM. So, if you’re looking for something dark, twisted and experimental, this is probably not it. However, if you want to just chill out to a fantastic series of what could almost be the lost Surfing on Sine Waves (Polygon Window, 1993) album, look no further.RX-101 does have a series of other EPs—many of which contain some very aggressive acid tracks too, should that tickle your fancy.
