"Los Angeles, California based Julian Gray (Known most for his Youtube Channel, JulianGrayMedia, and his releases on mau5trap, and Enhanced Recordings) has taken the next steps in his career and has unveiled a big announcement. Julian started development on an idea to create a new multi-arts collective/music label a few years ago, and after years of taking his plan into action, launched this week as Graydient Collective. Graydient plans on releasing a variety of music and other forms of art, including poetry, design, motion graphics and everything in between. For now however, the collective just launched their pilot compilation “Colors, Vol. 1”. There’s a variety of tunes of all genres, including Progressive House, Deep House, Techno and Trance. My favorites of the compilation are Ghost Data’s “Angelic Layer”, 5haus & APER7URE’s Human Prototype, Sole Vale’s Motion, Porth Nole & Kaylo’s Black Hole and Watney’s Bellavista. Check out the full compilation below and make sure you keep an eye out for this Collective!

"If you’ve had the opportunity to catch Major Lazer live in recent months, you may have noticed only Diplo and Walshy Fire rocking the stage. Well, after Governor’s Ball this past weekend it seems clear that longtime collaborator Ape Drums will now be taking the place of Jillionaire going forward. This news has been confirmed by Billboard. After eight years with the trio, Jillionaire has officially left Major Lazer to pursue a solo career.There has been no official statement from the Caribbean-influenced trio just yet but we can imagine they will look to clear the air on this news sooner rather than later. comments",articles10,"['Major Lazer', 'Walshy Fire', 'Jillionaire', 'Major Lazer']"
"Zedd announced his forthcoming Orbit tour earlier this year, officially beginning in Seattle at the WaMu Theater on September 13. (Fans can catch him a week earlier in Los Angeles for Zedd in the Park at the LA State Historic Park with TroyBoi, Keys N Krates, and more.) But fans at Red Rocks last night got an early look at the new tour production.The Orbit Tour will feature all new production for Zedd that will slightly resemble that of his Echo Tour previously. Only this time, the structure Zedd stands on is kinetic, and moves around him during the show. It only moves on one axis, but both the inner and outer sides are LED equipped to keep things interesting, even when the man himself is obscured by the structure.Watch the video below to see it in action as he plays out his collab “Adrenaline” with Grey.

"Earlier this year, a study that found low frequency music, such as dubstep, disrupted normal mosquito behavior such as feeding and mating went absolutely viral. The study specifically used Skrillex’s EP  for the case study, making it go even more viral in the dance music community.Now, Apotek Hjärta, a pharmacy in Sweden, has put out a playlist of remixed nursery rhymes in support of the theory. Writes DJ Mag, the pharmacy “hired duo Kloudmen to reimagine six nursery rhymes in a dubstep fashion, using intense frequencies throughout the tracks to confuse the Mosquitoes.”Of course, the original nursery rhymes are in Apotek’s native Swedish — the melodies are familiar but the words will obviously be foreign to those who don’t speak the language. And then there’s the dubstep remix to take into account. Honestly, this whole project is absurd and hilarious and who knows if it actually works in real life applications, but this is too incredible for us to care.Listen to the full playlist below.  dubstephilariousmosquitonursery rhymesPharmacyRemixedrepellentswedishLover of all bass music.

"Researchers at the University of Arizona in the US have made a breakthrough in their study on tinnitus in mice which could eventually lead to a cure in humans. According to the study published in the journal PLOS Biology, blocking a specific protein that fuels brain inflammation in the mice stopped the condition in its tracks.The treatment works on a molecule called TNF-A (tumour necrosis factor alpha) that disrupts communication between neurons. When this communication is disrupted, neuro inflammation is halted, believed by the researchers to be a major contributing factor to the condition.Study co-author Professor Shaowen Bao said, “Genetic knock out of TNF-A or pharmacologically blocking its expression prevented neuro-inflammation and ameliorated the behaviour associated with tinnitus in mice with noise induced hearing loss.”As with any animal trial, far more rigorous study needs to be conducted before the treatment is applied to humans.Even with the success of this study, scientists maintain that the underlying process of tinnitus remains a mystery. The most common cause of tinnitus is damage and loss of the tiny sensory hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear, called stereocilia. This tends to happen as people age, and it can also result from prolonged exposure to excessively loud noise. Hearing loss may coincide with tinnitus.The team of scientists are hopeful their research will lead to a gene therapy to combat ringing in the ears and other hearing loss disorders, possibly even in a simple pill form. hearing losspossible cureResearchscientistsStudyTinnitustreatmentuniversity of arizonaLover of all bass music.

"In the grand scheme of things, music streaming is still relatively new. Legislation is still catching up, and lord knows the labels are far behind. But technology waits for no one, and platforms keep making advancements that both benefit and, inadvertently, end up harming artists.A new report from  suggests that artists could be losing $300 million a year to fake streams on Spotify, although the reality of the situation is far more nuanced. The publication was made aware of the issue by Louis Posen, founder of the long-running California label Hopeless Records, who noticed a discrepancy in his company’s streaming numbers. After running the numbers himself, he found that six user-created and -manipulated playlists had accounted for 100% of the new streams to his label’s music.By extrapolating these results with his own unnamed sources, Posen claims artists lose “around $300 million in potential lost revenue moved from legitimate streams to illegitimate, illegal streams.”The belief that legitimate artists lose money to illegitimate streams is based on the belief that there’s a “finite pot of revenue” in streaming, according to Bruce Houghton, who runs the music industry news site Hypebot.“If any of that that goes to an illegitimate source [due to streaming manipulation], that’s a problem for [members of the independent community],” he told the crowd during a panel discussion about streaming manipulation at Indie Week.Streaming manipulation is not a new concept to the music industry, but it’s one that artists continue to fight against as they vie for their own place amongst several powerful playlists which drive a high percentage of plays to tracks worldwide.  likens stream manipulation to “the digital equivalent of steroids,” and it’s not entirely inaccurate.Looking into these issues is still in its infancy; meanwhile, those who aim to manipulate streams and augment their plays for monetary gain continue to find new ways to game the system. Rolling Stone IndustrymanipulationpanelSpotifyStreamingLover of all bass music.

"All too often, people find themselves wondering what someone said in some song and they type  they heard in Google, and Google spits out the right words. That’s an solution that Genius is taking issue with, as the lyrics site has now claimed that Google is stealing lyrics… and Genius claims they can prove it, too.Genius is more than just a lyrics website, as it allows users to annotate lyrics in real time to give them more context and allow visitors to more deeply understand the words behind a song. But for a majority of users, they’re just wondering if Jimi Hendrix wanted to kiss “the sky” or “this guy.” And Genius claims that Google is usurping its traffic by intercepting users on their way to the site.The site claims it can prove this, as they’ve devised a system of alternating apostrophes within lyrics to create a watermark of sorts. When this series of alternations was found in lyrics on Google, Genius marked the case solved. To add insult to injury, Genius says it ordered the different apostrophes in such a way that when the two styles are converted to dots and dashes they spell out “red handed” in Morse code. Ouch.Google, of course, denies the allegations.“The lyrics displayed in the information boxes on Google Search are licensed from a variety of sources and are not scraped from sites on the web,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “We take data quality and creator rights very seriously, and hold our licensing partners accountable to the terms of our agreement. We’re investigating this issue with our data partners and if we find that partners are not upholding good practices we’ll end our agreements.”Google further told  that it uses a third-party site called LyricFind to source the lyrics that appear on the search engine. LyricFind also, predictably, denied that it took the lyrics from Genius.In a statement to , Genius Chief Strategy Officer Ben Gross said that the company has “shown Google irrefutable evidence again and again that they are displaying lyrics copied from Genius in their Lyrics OneBox.

"Content warning: this article contains descriptions of sexual violence, rape, and sexual assault.On an episode of the BBC podcast the Next Episode, a series that focuses on #MeToo and people’s experiences in the music industry, Aluna Francis of AlunaGeorge has come forward about her own experience with sexual assault.In her conversation on the podcast, Francis told the BBC that a past collaborator, whom she wishes to remain unnamed, attempted to force her to perform oral sex on him.After making music with this person earlier in the day, they’d gone out as a group and Francis couldn’t get home as her phone had died. He offered to let her use his charge in his hotel room, after she’d already asked everyone else in the group and hotel staff and no one else could help her. However, once they were alone in the room Francis said the man became “a completely different person – his behavior went from naught to 100.”She went on to add that the man “pinned me down and he’d taken his trousers down and he was trying to put his dick in my mouth. So I wrestled him off, and he was still laughing cause he thought it was a game and that I was having a really fun time having a pretend rape situation.”Francis addresses the shame she felt for not recognizing how wrong the situation was immediately, for compartmentalizing what had happened. She claimed she never considered reporting the incident to the police.She said escaped the situation, but later returned to the studio where she confronted the man about what had happened in the hotel room. “He did all his apologies and talked about how he was so incredibly sorry and [that] this has never happened before,” she said. “You’re dealing with it all the time. Even if it goes up to a high level, you’re still playing out this role of ‘It’s fine.'”You can listen to the full episode here.  aluna francisAlunaGeorgebbcinterviewnext episodepodcastrapeLover of all bass music.

"In September 2018, the City of Miami made the decision to not renew Ultra’s contract at Bayfront Park, thereby forcing the festival to find a new venue with barely 6 months until showtime. While Virginia Key served as a fine intermediary, 2019’s Ultra was still not the perfect event.Ultra has been courted heavily by Homestead-Miami Speedway, which last month successfully petitioned to extend its operational hours until 2am to accommodate the festival. But now, the City of Miami wants Ultra back at Bayfront Park, as evidenced by the resolution item shown below.Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has been quoted saying Ultra Music Festival represents “hundreds of millions of dollars in economic impact” for Miami every year. Hundreds of millions of dollars that have the potential to go somewhere else if the city kept acting so frequently hostile toward the major festival. “I was always a long-term supporter of Ultra as commissioner because I really felt that it went to the brand of the city,” Suarez said, acknowledging that changes would have had to be made if the festival stayed in Miami. “We had the attention of the world during that week similarly to Basel during Art Basel week for the arts community.”Commissioner Manolo Reyes has said, “We can not be running businesses out of the City of Miami. Hialeah wants it. Homestead wants it. Everybody wants it. That’s why I want to know what happened.”Last year, Ultra was forced to scramble to create a worthwhile event at Virginia Key with less than half a year of notice — if it is brought back to Bayfront Park, the festival could see a massive boom in 2020 and a return to its usual excellence.The resolution is on the agenda for the city council meeting dated June 27. At that time, the council will vote to officially offer a new contract to Ultra, or not to.

"Spotify just did some serious rearranging and Premium users aren’t too pleased about it.The mobile app for iOS and Android just unleashed some divisive changes, which should really only affect Premium users. Spotify seemed to think it was doing its most dedicated users a favor, but they aren’t feeling it.Streamlining of the libraries for Premium users makes it easy to swipe between tabs to access their saved music and podcasts. Broken down by playlists, artists, and albums, the tabs make sense.Here’s where the problem lies — the artists section only includes those followed by the account, not all the artists saved to the library. Another complaint is that the artists aren’t listed in alphabetical order by default.Spotify users have sounded off:Spotify has since released a statement:Spotify says its taking into account all of the feedback.Hey @Spotify the new update is god awful change it— Sarah ✨🔮 JOHNJAE AU (@witchyrenjun) June 19, 2019This @Spotify update might be the single worst thing that has happened to me.What the fuck have you done to library??— Josh Willmott (@jtwillmott) June 13, 2019This Spotify update is fucking TRASH— HEF-AYE (@Pablo_Spicasso) June 13, 2019The new spotify update is genuinely, sincerely, one of the worst updates of anything ever.

"When someone says Ottawa, what follows is typically something along the lines of, “Where?” It’s true that Canada’s capital city (it’s in Ontario by the way) is a little behind the times when it comes to EDM when compared to neighbouring cities like Montreal or Toronto; but in fact, its electronic music scene is healthy and thriving and has been since the ’90s.The now-defunct club Atomic was a regular stop for scene veterans like Sasha and Digweed and Richie Hawtin in the ’90s and Mercury Lounge is still kickin’ to this day. Nowadays, clubs like City at Night and Aléa regularly host top DJs across all genres and festivals like Escapade are making the city worth a weekender to the nation’s capital. With the 10th anniversary of Bud Light Escapade Festival unfolding in just a few days featuring a lineup stacked with names like Kayzo, DJ Snake, Zeds Dead, Tiësto, KSHMR, Tiga, Adventure Club, 1788-L and more, here are five more reasons — not that you need them — why Ottawa is worth the trip this weekendAfter years (if not decades) of promoters trying to bring big names to a small city, DNA stepped in and changed everything. Their perseverance caught the eye of Beach Club in Montreal and festival giants Live Nation and made a festival size event like Escapade Possible in a city that most people have never heard of.“Our success is probably attributed to a team whose belief is that Ottawa ISN’T a sleepy city. Our mentality has always been that if we provide the city with world-class events and artists that they will support us and as we can see, they have. From day one, we’ve had the mentality that ‘if you build it, they will come’.”Undoubtedly, the organizers of Escapade are responsible for turning up the volume on Canada’s sleepy capital city. From the Ottawa Baseball Stadium to Rideau Carleton Raceway to Landsdowne Park, Escapade will host its 10th anniversary edition this upcoming weekend with upwards of 30,000 people and will see several upgrades this year, according to the organizers. “We have a major change this year at the site in that we are moving our arena stage to outdoors on the football field. This allows us to increase our capacity and lend the event a more festival feel by having two outdoor stages.“Our VIP experience will also be enhanced with more washrooms, special fx, and more seating. Our vendor village will offer more food choices including healthy alternatives and vegan options on top of standard festival fare. We will also have massage stations and a partnership with Kandies world that will bring some products to the festival that we’ve never had before.”Ottawa might have a small city vibe but that makes it an ace destination to party. Think cheaper hotels, shorter taxi rides, and smaller queues. With DJs coming in weekly, events are cozy and vibes are big. DNA, the organizers of Escapade, play a big part in that, too.“We produce a number of EDM acts annually in Ottawa. Outside of Escapade, we produce another yearly festival in Gatineau (the Ottawa region) called Riverside. This two-day event has quickly grown over the past five years to having 10,000 attendees. This year we are on track to break that number. We’ve also been doing events at the EY Centre during the school year with acts like Deadmau5, DVBBS, Steve Angello, Above & Beyond, Jauz, Hardwell, Marshmello, and more. Lastly, Barrymores music hall does weekly EDM events at their venue which has seen some of the biggest acts play over the years.”Veteran clubs like Mercury Lounge, Babylon and Barrymores are still going strong with parties and afterparties but newcomers like City At Night and Aléa Nightclub are also on the not-to-miss-list when on a weekender to Ottawa. With an 11pm curfew at the festival grounds, Escapade has gone all out with afterparties for this particular weekend. See the full rundown below:City At NightFriday June 21st with Ramiro Lopez
Saturday June 22nd with Billy Kenny
Sunday June 23rd with Ferry Corsten & Markus SchulzBarrymoresSaturday June 22nd with 12th Planet
Sunday June 23rd with Loud LuxuryAléa NightclubSaturday June 22nd with Mercer
Sunday June 23rd with Bassjackers and Breathe CarolinaBabylonSunday June 23rd with Adventure ClubWithout a doubt, Ottawa is a beautiful city – don’t sleep on it. Come a day early, stay a day later and don’t let your hangover get the best of you. The city is brimming with ultra cool restaurants (check Whalesbone, Union, and don’t miss The Manx for a killer hangover brunch) and bars serving local brews and super strong Caesars (the Canadian version of a Bloody Mary), not to mention a big number of moderately cheesy tourist attractions (I mean, what’s a trip to the capital without a selfie in front of Parliament). There is plenty more to do in your off time too, say the organizers.“In the summer you have to check out the restaurants in the Byward Market, a bike ride or stroll by the Rideau Canal and no trip to Ottawa should be complete without a stop at the Parliament buildings. The Byward Market area is filled with bars and restaurants and Casino Du Lac Leamy is only 5 min away which is home to Aléa Nightclub and is considered by many to be one of the best clubs in the region. The new Landsdowne Park has tons to do as well including bars, restaurants, and weekly events including Beer Festival, Yoga, Escapade, City Folk and more. Visiting Ottawa in the summer or winter always has something for everyone.” Escapade takes place in Ottawa on June 22nd and 23rd, which is just a few hours drive from Montreal and Toronto.

The duo released “Like That” with NGHTMRE in 2018 and “Better Believe It Now” in 2019, but now enter a new phase as they drop “You’re The One” with Nevve.“You’re The One” is noticeably more chill than anything on , or any of Big G’s recent tracks for that matter.

The annual show’s home venue is the iconic Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado, but this year they’re expanding to New York for the first time ever. Big Gigantic is bringing their full-on immersive 3D setup that they debuted at last year’s Colorado shows, along with additional performances by Hippie Sabotage, shallou, Louis Futon and ilo ilo.

"A video of an old Senate hearing from 2001 has the rave community rallying against Presidential candidate, former Vice President, and former Senator Joe Biden, after he said he wanted to criminalize raves and lock up promoters.Biden has never been known to be a proponent of raves in the first place, having introduced and sponsored the Reducing Americans’ Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, or the RAVE Act, which this hearing concerns itself with. The act was introduced particularly to bolster federal regulation and crackdowns on the party drug ecstasy, also known as MDMA. However, Biden was also publicly against ketamine and many other drugs.“I think this is a local problem,” he said about raves at the hearing. “If I were governor of my state or the mayor of my town, I would be passing new ordinances relating to stiff criminal penalties for anyone who holds a rave, the promoter, the guy who owns the building, I would put the son of a gun in jail, I would change the law.”He references a section of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 he cosponsored called the “crack-house law.” Biden encouraged authorities and the Senate to use that law to “tear down” any buildings, such as clubs and venues, which hosted raves. The pretense therein being that, since raves were commonly a place associated with ecstasy use, it could be inferred that promoters “knowingly” (an important part of the law) allowed the events to go on anyway.Biden said in the hearing, “I know of no other drug I’ve been exposed to studying that has such a profile in the circumstances under which its consumed as this drug,” later adding, “so I think we better send out a message to the local officials that if you are able to eliminate the circumstances and the places under which raves took place and/or policed those which on their face are legitimate, you would cut into this in an incredible way.”The Illicit Drug Anti-Proliferation Act (formerly known as the RAVE Act) passed the Senate and House on April 10, 2003 as an attachment to the child abduction-related AMBER Alert Bill. Hilary Clinton was a sponsor of the original bill.Watch the moment from the hearing here.Go here to read more about amending the RAVE Act. H/T Business Insider crack downecstasyhearingjailjoe bidenPromotersrave actRavessenateLover of all bass music.

"Legendary DJ/Producer Benny Benassi is back with his first original track of 2019, and it is an absolute club banger. Benny teams up with Chris Nasty for “Inside,” a tasty tech house track that takes you “deep inside” a dark club. This song comes at a perfect time with tech house seeing a huge spike in popularity. However, this isn’t someone jumping on a bandwagon, this is a legendary producer doing what he does best, putting out heaters for the dance floor.The track is built around a hypnotic bassline and pounding kick drum. Some vocals come in from the background, “the music deep inside, the music takes your mind” and you get some old school rave vibes. The buildup happens quickly and the drop is that same hypnotic bassline but with tons of percussion and production flourishes to get you groovin’ in the club. The formula for the track is simple, but the result is nothing short of perfection. Listening to the track, it reminds you of just how much Benny Benassi’s sound has influenced modern house music.Benny also played this past weekend at Exchange LA, Los Angeles’s premiere dance club, and he treated the packed house to two hours of non stop dancing. He pretty much stuck with house tunes to start and dropped a lot of his more recent tracks. The second part of his set saw him veering a little bit more old school and treating the crowd to his classic “Satisfaction.” Check out this clip of Benny’s performance at Exchange LA. Despite working non-stop this weekend, I still managed to sneak in some fun times. @bennybenassi throwing down a 2 hr set at @exchangela was definitely a highlight #edm #la #lasers #legend #weekend Everybody Needs A KissA post shared by  Mark (@farkmabrick) on There’s still some chances to see Benny in the U.S. this summer, tour dates below.June 28 – Ravine – Atlanta, GA

"One of the big, and lesser talked about missions of Second Sky from Porter Robinson this weekend was raising money for the Robinson Malawi Fund. As exciting as all the sets were, the festival also aimed to raise money toward ending Burkitt lymphoma, a type of cancer, in Malawi.Earlier this month, Porter said when revealing the fund, “I’m starting a fund in cooperation with UNC to help improve the survival rate in that region so that those families won’t have to needlessly lose loved ones. In this case, more resources translates directly into higher survival rates.”Now that the festival is over, Porter has revealed that “between donations at Second Sky, online donations, and $1 from each ticket,” $77,000 was raised for the fund! And since Porter himself was matching every dollar, $154,000 was raised for direct patient care.Porter’s fanbase is among the most devoted of any artist in dance music, and it’s incredible to see what everyone was able to accomplish over the course of such a magical weekend. Congratulations to everyone involved!

As it turns out, 65% believe you’re never too old to get down, especially at small local shows and concert venues.When it comes to attending multi-day music festivals, 72% say people should never stop doing that activity. Voodoo, Electric Zoo, Nocturnal Wonderland, Ultra, and Electric Daisy Carnival music festivals have the most concentrated belief that you’re never too old to attend.Talking raves and dance clubs, those numbers drop to 45% and 42% respectively.The cutoff age from the survey at which we may need to reevaluate our lives is 44. And still, overall, it seems age is just a number.If attending festivals and raves make you happy — go for it.

"A Swedish House Mafia appearance at Tomorrowland has been rumored more than once this year so far. First, in February, fans thought teasers for the festival’s One World Radio was hinting at the group. Then, in April, after it was determined to be just a radio station, other unnamed “inside sources” claimed the group would be performing.Now, in June, as if by clockwork, the rumor mill is starting up again… but this time, just maybe, there’s actually something to it. As reported by , the headliner slot at main stage for Sunday on both weekends is curiously empty after the full lineup was revealed last week. Perhaps an artist as big as Swedish House Mafia could fill that slot? While not a confirmation by any means, it’s something to consider.But it doesn’t end there.Somehow, someone discovered that if you tap the period key on your keyboard three times on the Tomorrowland homepage, fireworks erupt on screen. Three periods = three dots? SHM’s logo? It’s an awfully curious coincidence if it  pertain to the Swedish group. Other three-key combinations, including S-H-M, did not produce the same effect.So again the rumor mill is spinning, and there’s yet to be any confirmation of their appearance. But still, if I were at Tomorrowland this year, I’d keep my schedule open on Sunday… just in case.  fireworksheadlinerlogoopen slotrumorsswedish house mafiatomorrowlandLover of all bass music.

"“Animals,” the instant classic track by Martin Garrix, just turned 6 years old — and it’s still a banger.This thrilling production is truly one of the most influential tracks in all of dance music history. Back in 2013, “Animals” thrust a young Garrix from bedroom producer into a global superstar. Flash forward to now, the song is still wildly popular and has racked up nearly 1.3 billion views on YouTube.It’s hard to think of modern EDM if not for “Animals,” and before Garrix was dubbed the world’s #1 DJ. His household name and entire project truly embodies the genre and what people have come to expect from modern dance music. The original song released by Spinnin’ Records was just the beginning.However, “Animals” isn’t playing out quite as much as it typically would this festival season, as Garrix is currently on the mend. The producer suffered a serious ankle injury at a recent show and is expected to be out for weeks. He’s been forced to cancel a number of festival gigs.Play “Animals” again below and be sure to wish this legend a speedy recovery! His presence is deeply missed. Rukes.com #1 dj6 yearsanimalsMartin Garrixmusic videoProducer",articles6,['Martin Garrix']

"DJs might seem larger than life on stage, but it’s important to remember they’re human beings just like the rest of us. Like you, and me, and all of us — they’re just as prone to make mistakes. In a new post, Benzi leads the way as DJs reveal their most embarrassing moments on stage.Even the greats like Alison Wonderland, Slushii and Ekali have experienced the worst, mortifying moments that DJs can face. However, in the end it’s all about how they pushed through, bounced back, and shook off their worst embarrassments.From speeding up to 320 BPM, to having a song cut out mid-track, and even throwing up during a performance — these DJs have been through it. And, lived to tell the story.We totally feel for all of these DJ/producers, as they share their on-stage horror stories. In the moment, these things probably felt like the end of the world. Now, they’re all able to laugh it off together.Whether you DJ as a hobby or professionally or simply live to enjoy the music — keep in mind nobody is invincible. Don’t be too hard on yourself. If you have an embarrassing moment you’d like to share, feel free.Read some of Benzi’s thread below.➖Embarrassing DJ Stories Thread➖i'll go first. back in the day i used an old version of Traktor to change the tempo/key of a song to make edits, but only drawback was you had to record it in real time (aka listen to the whole song) to export it….— BENZI (@benzi) June 14, 2019of course my dumbass forgot to remove the middle of the song, & just as the club owner came over to compliment me, the song suddenly stops and there's 10 straight seconds of terrible fake scratching sounds. i tried to play it cool & act like this was all planned, but i was toast.— BENZI (@benzi) June 14, 2019I was sick & spewed on myself on stage. 2 different times.

"What happens in Ibiza, stays in Ibiza? The party island off the coast of the coast of Spain is known for its many clubs, perfect weather, and delicious cuisine — it’s also the perfect island getaway for some more of the patrons’ risque activities.This past week during a set at David Guetta’s residency for Ushuaia, a couple staying at the hotel was spotted on one of the balconies overlooking the club. And they were giving the crowd a show of their own.One onlooker said: “I was just getting getting into the music when I looked up and saw this couple naked on the balcony. They didn’t seem to have a care in the world.“She was on her knees in front of him performing a sex act and he had his hand on the wall to balance himself. It was all happening in broad daylight as David spun some tracks.”Another onlooker said: “They were at it a good ten minutes and had no care in the world. It was broad daylight and people were walking past so they would easily have been seen.”No consequences apparently befell the couple, nor was it said whether they were able to  finish their business. Rukes.com balconyclubdavid guettaibizaoral sexpublicsex actushuaiaLover of all bass music.

"Without a doubt, Skrillex has some of the best unreleased music and special edits of any DJ out there. Last weekend at Ultra Singapore, Skrillex dropped one of his best, an unreleased collaborative remix between him and Virtual Riot of his track “Face My Fears” with Utada Hikaru.Early supporters of the original “Face My Fears” loved the track, lauding it as the return of a Skrillex they’d been longing for — at the same time, it was lamented that he still wasn’t pushing some heavier wubs. Anyone who goes to see Skrillex live knows he still rinses plenty of heavy tunes, but what’s great about this new remix is that it definitely fills that void.It’s all business as usual right up until the drop, and then it just gets crazy. It’s not 140 dubstep but that doesn’t make the remix any less heavy and chaotic. Check out the video from Ultra Singapore below! No release date has been given for this huge tune. Rukes.com bass musicface my fearsremixskrillexultra singaporeutada hikaruvirtual riotLover of all bass music.

"NBA champions the Toronto Raptors and Toronto-native Drake had a night out on the town in Las Vegas this weekend. Of course, the winning game was all the cause for celebration as they hit up XS Nightclub late Friday night into Saturday.The Wynn Las Vegas nightclub was reportedly packed out and lively. Revelers were pleasantly surprised when the Raptors came through and Drake showed up as the unofficial emcee. The VIP section housed the entire team and the superstar rapper, who took to the mic throughout the night.“Las Vegas! Give it up for your MVP!” Drake said, calling out Kawhi Leonard. “Whooooo, here he is!”Earlier that day, Drake dropped two new tracks — “Money in the Grave” featuring Rick Ross and “Omertà” — to honor his favorite team. But the real musical highlight of the night was The Chainsmokers. The duo DJ’d the championship party and set the soundtrack for victory.The Larry O’Brien NBA Championship Trophy was also in attendance, strategically placed by the decks for the whole crowd to see.

The over-one-hour video footage shows police discovering drugs on the scene and searching Ty’s entire crew, including Skrillex.Last September, the hip hop star was busted just before an Atlanta show. Drug dogs went crazy while sniffing outside the Mercedes van he and his posse were inside. The footage of Ty Dolla $ign, Skrillex, and others getting searched went viral following Ty’s arrest. He was the only one taken into custody.Ty was charged with felony possession of cocaine, felony possession of THC and a misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He’s said to currently be involved in a Second Chance program in order to get the charges dropped. He must stay clean for 13 weeks.Around the time of the incident, Ty’s attorney Drew Findling spoke to Channel 2 Action News: “He had no drugs on his person at all. Apparently, there was a small amount of some drug found in the car and they let five people walk away. And they let the international superstar go into custody.”See the footage from September 5, 2018 below.

"A little less than two months ago, Martin Garrix teamed up with Macklemore and Patrick Stump of Fall Out Boy for the summer hit “Summer Days.” The track was a bit of a departure from Garrix’s normal style, but the fun and breezy hit was perfect for a drive with the windows down. Now, we get our first official remix of the tune, courtesy of keyboard maestro Haywyre.Haywyre manages to make this one all his own, taking elements few and far between from the original and focusing on what he does best: tickling the ivory. “Summer Days” gets reimagined and transformed into a super funky, super fresh work of art that makes the best of all vocals and melodies without compromising a thing.Check it out below!You can also catch Haywyre on tour in the UK for the first time as he travels with KOAN Sound to Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham, and London.

"Most outdoor festivals and events have a proviso stating “rain or shine,” assuring ticket buyers that the event will go on for as long as it can. But what about endangered species? A new challenge faced by Mamby on the Beach in Chicago threatens the event’s venue.A pair of endangered piping plovers who have built a nest at Montrose Beach has gained the attention of bird conservation groups lead by the Chicago Ornithological Society, as well as the Montrose Lakefront Coalition, which is seeking to have the festival moved away from the Montrose Beach area. The birds have laid four eggs, an event which  calls “a rare and cherished occasion among birders.”Jerry Mickelson, who heads up concert organizer JAM Productions, sent a letter to MLC that read, in part: “Why do you feel that MAMBY music fans do not have the right to enjoy Montrose Beach just like others do? Who appointed MLC as gate keeper?”He went on: “Let me warn you that there are millions of dollars at risk here and all of you might be exposing yourselves to this liability by your interference with our right to hold this event at Montrose Beach that you have requested/insisted the park district not allow.”The original four eggs were moved into the protection of the Lincoln Park Zoo after high water threatened them earlier this week, but the plovers appear undeterred and once again engaging in courtship activities. Should they lay another set of eggs, the chicks likely wouldn’t learn to fly until late August, stated Jill Niland of MLC.The musical festival is scheduled to take place on Aug. 23 and 24 and expected to draw as many as 20,000 people to the lakefront each day, which raises concern over “waves of people and noise pollution from three stages disrupting the piping plovers and any potential offspring.”No decision has been made at this time. birdschicagoeggsendangered speciesfestivalmamby on the beachmatingoffspringpiping ploversLover of all bass music.

After teasing it earlier this week, “Rescue Me” with emo band A Day To Remember is finally out.ADTR’s Jeremy McKinnon does a phenomenal job in the new single accompanied by Marshmello’s always saccharine production and easily digestible beats. The grungy guitar riffs and live instrumentation certainly adds to the hype, and will probably earn the collaboration some live performance spots on late night TV shows.“Rescue Me” comes with a music video which shows Mello and ADTR trying to survive on a deserted island — of course, they’ve still got their instruments to play and marshmallows to roast over the fire.

"Google this week decided to flip the script and leak images of its own phone, the upcoming Pixel 4, months before its expected launch in October. CNET gives a brief overview suggesting why Google might’ve chosen to do it this way, but the fact of the matter is that it’s here.The leaked image shows a square camera bump, as theorized from leaks earlier last week. This matches with iPhone 11 rumors, as well, though as CNET points out, neither are the first to have such a design. (See the Huawei Mate 20 Pro.) It also has a distinct lack of the two-tone back it usually sports, as well as a lack of rear fingerprint sensor. Both Samsung and Apple have theirs on the front, so maybe Google is following suit? It’s also possible the phone will begin to incorporate facial recognition.Pixel 4 will be a chance for Google to redeem itself after the lackluster launch of its Pixel 3 and XL, which had to compete against other more successful flagships from Samsung and Apple. Google announced its Pixel 3A line in May to try and address the issue.More news about the Pixel 4 will come in the following months — a functional model has already been spotted in the wild, even.

Together, UTA and Paradigm would have undoubtedly controlled one of the greatest entertainment agencies in the world, marking one of the biggest deals in music history.However, Gores explained that after “careful consideration” it was ultimately decided the merger will not happen. “…in the end,” he said, “what is more compelling for us is how unique the culture at Paradigm is and how powerful our independent path can be.”Jeremy Zimmer, UTA’s chief executive, issued a separate statement of his own.

"It’s barely been a week since Avicii’s posthumous album was released, and Tiësto is already coming out swinging with a new remix of the artist’s song “Tough Love” with Agnes, Vargas & Lagola.“Tough Love” was released as the second single from  and features an Arabian influence in the strings with a more subdued drop section that plays more to a quick-paced ballroom dance than jumping and raging in a crowd at a festival.Tiësto figured there should at least be some of that; he puts his own spin on the original by taking the melody and chopping it up, modulating it, and giving it a much more bouncy rhythm. Now tuned for the main stage, tens of thousands can rage to Avicii again when they catch Tiësto dropping this live.Listen to one legend remix another below. Rukes.com albumaviciihousemain stageremixtiestotimTough LoveLover of all bass music.

"Bonnaroo Squarch Has Attendees Asking What’s Going OnExactly three weeks ago, Bonnaroo burned its iconic arch to the ground. Bonnaroo issued a statement, “This incarnation of the Bonnaroo Arch had significant structural issues and needed to be removed. The Arch has changed throughout the years, and we’re exited for its newest incarnation.”“Its newest incarnation” as Bonnaroo put it is what attendees are now referring to as the Bonnaroo squarch – a portmanteau for square and arch. See below.Happy 18th Birthday, @Bonnaroo? 🤷‍♀️ pic.twitter.com/BalFhCu154— Roo Bus (@TheRealRooBus) June 11, 2019The blocky, unsightly entrance to the festival is affixed with LED panels on the front that will have it changing design throughout the festival.

"Many electronic artists are known for their particular styles, whether it’s the use of a particular synth, drum loop, melody, key, or string of notes. Often, these artists may end up turning down requests for collaborations if their style doesn’t mesh with the other artist. Zeds Dead and DROELOE are two artists whose styles we didn’t think would mesh; but after hearing them together on their new song “Stars Tonight,” it’s scary how well they actually do.Both Zeds Dead and DROELOE have kept the releases pretty light for 2019, making this collaboration even more special. And even though both artists add their own flavor to the release as a whole, it’s fairly easy to see where each contributed more. DROELOE’s melodic inclinations are on full display in the main lead, while Zeds Dead have a heavier hand in the drums, particularly the breaks (at 1:57), and the second drop.“Stars Tonight” is a unique collaboration that manages to play to the strengths of both artists equally, which isn’t something you find every day.

European Astronaut Corps will present the first DJ set in space, live from the International Space Station.According to DJ Mag, Parmitano’s DJ training coordinated by BigCityBeats and German DJ Le Shuuk is quite intensive, heavily focused on both DJing and production to ready him for his set. He’s learning from the best, as Le Shuuk previously took part in BigCityBeats’ Zero Gravity excursion.As for the space debut, the live set will be steamed via satellite for those in attendance at BigCityBeats’ WORLD CLUB DOME Cruise Edition. The luxury cruise will host 3,000 revelers as they voyage across the Mediterranean Sea in style — and the music they hear will truly be out-of-this world.NASA also recently called on music fans to help curate a spaceflight playlist to soundtrack the next trip to the moon.

"Last month, we heard about the goat that hit up Movement music festival in Detroit. Over the pond, there’s a camel raving it up with his owner as the two take on festivals together.Kokoso and the owner were recently spotted roaming the crowds at Land Beyond Festival in East Brighton Park. Rebecca Fosset and her daughter head up A J Camels, a company that provides camels for entertainment. Kokoso has been on film sets including , and at events in churches and hotels.Animal activists have stepped in, arguing that music festivals are no place for camels, or really any animals for that matter. With the loud music, large crowds, and hectic lights at at any given music event, it’s hard to argue with concerns — but Fosset and her daughter don’t see the issue.She claims the “so-called animal lovers” don’t know what they are talking about.“You do realize camels love drum and bass? They like other music too,” she explains. “Have you ever seen camels listen to jazz? They absolutely love it, they react like humans do.”In a report from , Fosset thoroughly offers more from her perspective…“I was completely shocked at the aggression towards my daughter and we are thinking of taking legal action. And I don’t know if people were particularly aggressive at the festival because they were off their faces, but it was ridiculous.“At no point was [the camel] under any stress. He was quite happy sitting and enjoying the music. We deliberately put a pen around him to stop festival-goers hugging him too much because that would have stressed him out.”The other side of this argument, again, is hard to ignore. A spokeswoman from the RSPCA says…“The RSPCA would have welfare concerns about any animal, including camels, having to appear at a festival. The large crowds of partying people and loud music is likely to be very stressful.” Source/Photo:  animal activistsAnimal RightscamelMusic FestivalWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"DJ Snake has already released a few tracks in 2019, including “SouthSide” with Eptic and “Enzo” with Sheck Wes, Offset, 21 Savage, and Gucci Mane. Now, it seems he’s getting ready to put things in overdrive as SUMMER 19 officially kicks off this Friday.One thing to note here super quickly: summer 2019 doesn’t “officially” begin until June 21, so it seems pretty clear he’s not talking about the actual season here. Or perhaps he means it figuratively? Either way, it’s for sure that he’s dropping a new song at the end of the week. The head of marketing at Geffen, DJ Snake’s label, posted the video to his story with the caption, “Be prepared to have this one stuck in your head for the rest of the year.”DJ Snake previously revealed to Zane Lowe at Beats 1 that his album was coming out this summer — this could be the first official single.Check out the teaser for his next single out Friday, featuring J Balvin and Tyga, below.

"Well, rumors of a whole new Flume mixtape have come and gone, but we still get new Flume music today and that’s no reason to be upset. “Let You Know” with London Grammar is out now, and fits in more with his post-mixtape single “Friends” than the glitchy, sound design-heavy work on .Of course, that isn’t to say that he doesn’t flex a bit. His usual melodic genius is in full display in the “chorus” and his crisp drums and production are present throughout. It’s a slower track, playing more off the vocals of London Grammar’s Hannah Reid than his own intricacies. Yet, undoubtedly, this is a wonderful new single.It’s still unclear if there will be another full album/mixtape out this year, but Flume told fans in a Reddit AMA that he would be releasing music much more steadily in 2019.

"Nearly a month since Rezz debuted her collaboration with Underoath at EDC Las Vegas, fans can now finally listen to the complete track whenever they want as “Falling” is officially out.The single comes with a music video featuring Underoath’s Aaron Gillespie and Rezz in a dark warehouse. The two are involved in what seems to be some kind of torture or medical experiment, with Gillespie tied down by restraints, wearing a VR headset, and Rezz creepily approaching him with her trademark goggles.It turns out to be more of a virtual reality  theme, as Gillespie finds himself in a make believe escape room with horrifying conditions for making it out.As for the track itself, Rezz takes a much more metal and rock approach to the track as compared to her previous releases, no doubt due to influence from her collaborators. The new sound combination works brilliantly and paints a bright picture for the future of Rezz’s sound.Check out “Falling” from Rezz and Underoath below! Rukes.com collaborationedc las vegasfallinghybridmetalofficially outRezzunderoathLover of all bass music.

"Radiohead just uploaded approximately 18 hours worth of material from the band’s era — and the reasoning behind the unexpected release is quite interesting.Apparently a hacker got ahold of some mini disc files recorded from 1995 – 1998 and demanded a ransom in the value of $150,000, giving the iconic group an ultimatum. Either pony up the dough, or the stolen sessions would be released to the public.Well, Radiohead took matters into their own hands and decided to release the music on their own free will. That way, fans can still enjoy the collection of music they call “not v interesting.” They added, “it may as well be out there.”In sum, the hacker’s plan totally backfired. For the next 18 days fans can download the 18 mini disks and 18 hours worth of material for just £18.

"DJ Snake Drops New Song With J Balvin & Tyga A Day EarlyDespite all social media posts from DJ Snake pointing to a new song this Friday, he’s just dropped “Loco Contigo” with J. Balvin and Tyga a day early.The release of the song comes with its own music video, directed by Colin Tilley (an award-winning filmmaker known for his work with artists like Kendrick Lamar, Rihanna, and Nicki Minaj). Stylistically, it bears a lot of resemblance to “Taki Taki” in that it’s a rather unremarkable beat paired with multicultural vocalists. Though, whereas “Taki Taki” is gibberish, “Loco Contigo” translates to “crazy with you.”DJ Snake’s team is hopeful for another billion play hit. With powerhouses like DJ Snake and J. Balvin in the cut, it’s definitely possible.

"A rumor begun by DJ Mag Germany that Swedish House Mafia would be cancelling shows in light of a new deal with Live Nation has caught the eye of none other than Steve Angello — and he’s not holding back.In short, the report alleged that SHM had signed a contract with Live Nation for a full stadium tour that would end up forcing the group to back out of any festival gigs that didn’t directly or indirectly benefit Live Nation. Steve Angello, one member of the Swedish House Mafia trio, posted a succinct and direct message to his Instagram story.The screenshot has already been discussed at length on SHM forums and Reddit. But while fans are happy to hear that there’s fake news going around, the lack of specificity, as well as the remaining silence about the UMF Korea cancellation, still has them on their guard.The trio’s next scheduled appearance is at Tinderbox on the 27th of June. If the group appears there, no issues, it will at least assuage some rumors. If not, then “tinderbox” is rather appropriate for the firestorm the group will set off.  DJ Mag GermanyLive Nationreplyresponserumorsstadium toursteve angelloswedish house mafiaLover of all bass music.

"Last week, Mix247 reported that Okeechobee Music & Arts Festival was bought out by Insomniac and would be returning next year. Your EDM reached out to our own sources and independently confirmed the news.Our source, who wishes to remain anonymous, tells us that Insomniac bought a controlling share in Okeechobee, previously produced by Soundslinger, LLC. Okeechobee last ran in 2018, featuring headlining performances by Arcade Fire, Bassnectar, Halsey, Travis Scott, and Snoop Dogg. The festival confirmed in November 2018 that it would not be returning in 2019, releasing a statement that said:Okeechobee would be Insomniac’s second property in the state of Florida, apart from EDC Orlando. While some acts might conflict, a radius clause would not be imposed as the two share a promoter; furthermore, Okeechobee’s lineup, if it stays similar to past years, features a more diverse selection of artists than your typical EDC fare.No official announcement has been made from any party involved.

He was described as “furious” and “angry and yelling” over the whole ordeal.

"This Woman Put A Bong In Her Butt & Had A Whole Festival Smoke Out Of It While Tied UpQuick, think of the strangest thing you’ve ever seen at a music festival… too bad, Snatch Adams has it beat.The live artist performer recently went to an unnamed music festival and had the experience of a lifetime when she had dozens of people smoke out of a bong that had been placed in her butt. Yes, you are reading that correctly. Adams felt the need to one-up her performance piece at the festival a year prior in which she laid in a coffin for 2.5 hours while 45,000 mealworms ate her skin. Again, you are reading that correctly. (More on that here.)This year, Adams went more on the audience participation route. At the festival, she was tied up shibari-style on “a small platform next to the main stage,” a glass bong placed into her butthole, and one by one members from the crowd came up to smoke out of it.“One guy told me the next day that he hadn’t smoked weed for 20 years,” Adams confided, “but knew he needed to do it out of my butt no matter what.”Adams’ entire story is almost too ridiculous to be true — so I guess it’s good that she included photo evidence! Read the whole thing below and keep scrolling for her Instagram post with pics.@rachellark@jeffweiz@cryptation@mr_nightshade #buttbong. Last year at my favorite festival, @rachellark and I schemed up an art project for which I lay in a coffin for 2.5 hours while mealworms ate my skin. This year, people kept asking me how I was going to one-up it. I wasn’t going to try! Well, within two hours of arriving last weekend, @jeffweiz ran into me and Rachel and asked, “Hey Snatch, how do you feel about people smoking weed out of your butthole?” Rachel and I looked at each other and smiled. I said, “I feel great about that. Tell us more.” Weiz and his brother had made two prototype hand-blown glass butt bongs, with a reservoir of water that goes inside the body, and no one had ever tested them out before. He thought I was the perfect person to ask. I gotta say, he was right. The idea quickly developed into a spectacle. At 2am I got onto a small platform next to the main stage, naked. @cryptation, who happened to bring all his Shibari gear with him, made a very sexy show of tying me up and suspending me. Ass up, head down, legs spread. The crowd would have been happy with that as a performance, but once I was up, Alexis came up and put the plug in. The crowd didn’t know what was happening…until he filled it with weed and took a hit. A cheer erupted as we invited everyone at the festival to smoke weed out of my butt. Second pic is of Rachel showing us how it’s done! I’m not sure how many people took part, but we had it up and running for about an hour. We were about to put the second plug in my pussy and invite people to smoke DMT out of it but we got shut down for being a rogue project that was…controversial, to say the least. But in that short time, the response was overwhelming. One guy told me the next day that he hadn’t smoked weed for 20 years, but knew he needed to do it out of my butt no matter what. My favorite review of it was “It raised the rating of the festival by an entire star.” Yes, my butt got burned by the lighter a bunch. Yes, I’ll probably be forever known as the “mealworm butt bong girl.” Was it worth it? HELL YEAH!! That was one of the craziest experiences of my life.

The EDM supergroup has reportedly signed a contract with Live Nation for a full stadium tour. This according to sources close to SHM and .The bad news… Live Nation may force the group to back out of any festival gigs that don’t directly or indirectly benefit the entertainment company, according to the same report. Of course, we all want a reunion tour — but at what expense?As it stands, SHM are set to perform Tinderbox, Ultra Europe, Creamfields and more.Stay tuned for more details on SHM’s apparent stadium tour. DJ Mag Germany CancellationDJ Mag GermanyLive NationMusic Festivalreunion tourstadium tourswedish house mafiaWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"After the disastrous events of TomorrowWorld 2015, the festival decided to cancel the following year’s event and it hasn’t been back to the US since. In lieu of one of the biggest festival brands of the world, local Atlanta event Imagine Music Festival took over the dates and has been at Atlanta Motor Speedway since 2016.Now, it’s possible that the festival could move to TomorrowWorld’s old venue in Chattahoochee Hills in the next couple years. According to , Chattahoochee Hills City Manager Robbie Rokovitz confirmed “that local officials will be meeting with Imagine Festival founder Glenn Goodhand about moving the three-day concert to Bouckaert’s Farm in fall 2021.”Imagine Festival spokesman Chad Shearer told , “We do not have plans to move the festival in the foreseeable future.”“Our focus is on having a incredible 2019 and we are looking forward to welcoming everyone back to Imagine,” he continued. “Obviously, we are always looking for the best options for Imagine, but for now we are at the Speedway and love the amenities it provides.”A meeting was previously scheduled for June 4 between Chattahoochee Hills City Council members and Goodhand, but Mayor Tom Reed said it never ended up moving forward. However, an uncovered email addressed to Reed from Rokovitz allegedly reaffirms Goodhand’s intent to hold the event at Bouckaert’s Farm in 2021.As of this moment, Imagine Music Festival 2019 is still scheduled for September 20-22 at the Atlanta Motor Speedway. Rukes.com atlantachattahoochee hillsdevelopingimagine music festivalTomorrowWorldunconfirmedLover of all bass music.

"According to a NEW REPORT from , a fire that ripped through Universal Music Studios in 2008 damaged far more than Universal Music Group originally let on. When news of the fire broke in June 2008, the majority of major news outlets focused on the loss from the video vault “that contained only copies of old works.” In reality, decades and hundreds of thousands of original masters and recordings of classic pieces of music were lost.Jody Rosen, the original author of the article for , called the original release of information in 2008 a “triumph of crisis management.” The only reason we’re just now hearing about the loss of music is because documents from the company have been laid out during ongoing litigation.The loss has been described as “a huge musical heritage” in one internal UMG correspondence, and “historic” by Rosen. A conservative estimate of the music lost “includes recordings by Ray Charles, B.B. King, the Four Tops, Joan Baez, Neil Diamond, Sonny and Cher, Joni Mitchell, Cat Stevens, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Al Green, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Jimmy Buffett, the Eagles, Aerosmith, Rufus and Chaka Khan, Barry White, Patti LaBelle, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, the Police, Sting, Steve Earle, R.E.M., Janet Jackson, Guns N’ Roses, Mary J. Blige, No Doubt, Nine Inch Nails, Snoop Dogg, Nirvana, Beck, Sheryl Crow, Tupac Shakur, Eminem, 50 Cent and the Roots.” continues, “The fire also claimed numerous hit singles, likely including Bill Haley and His Comets’ ‘Rock Around the Clock,’ Etta James’s ‘At Last’ and the Kingsmen’s ‘Louie Louie.'”Read the full piece from here. cover updestroyedhistoricllost musicmastersmusic fireUniversal Music Groupuniversal studiosLover of all bass music.

"For all the nostalgia that it carries, Woodstock 50 has not had an easy time. After a variety of issues from artists to fan reception to funding, the festival was finally able to secure emergency funding three weeks ago thanks to  the Oppenheimer & Co. brokerage and investment bank.Now, however, the festival is faced with another issue at least on par with losing its funding: it just lost its venue.According to a statement released by the venue today, “Watkins Glen International terminated the site license for Woodstock pursuant to provisions of the contract. As such, WGI will not be hosting the Woodstock 50 Festival.”Which provisions of the contract isn’t known at this time, but suffice it to say, the festival and founder Michael Lang need another miracle. Consequence of Sound cancelledcontractfestivalpulled outwatkins glenWoodstockLover of all bass music.

In theory, it sounds like a great way to meet people going to the same events as you as they’ll likely have a very similar taste in music. In practice… not so much. writer Julia Gray was brave enough to try it herself, and the reality is it’s pretty much Tinder — but at a music festival.

"It’s a constant battle between the social media platforms — especially Facebook and company-owned Instagram vs. Snapchat. Now, the latter is presenting a new feature, straight out of Facebook’s playbook.According to insider Jane Manchun Wong, Snapchat Events may soon be integrated with the app. The new feature is likely to go hand in and with Snap Map, which updates friends’ locations, revealing what they’re up to on any given night.Facebook has already seen much success in making its Events tab part of regular social use. Public and private events can be made — and the tool is ideal for promoting concerts, festivals, and other music-related events, as well as social gatherings irl.Snapchat’s forthcoming feature will allow any user to create an event, assign a time and place, and swipe up to invite friends. Much like Facebook Events, there will also be the option to make them public or private.Facebook and Instagram have both used the platform as inspiration for a number of popular features. It only makes sense that Snapchat would return the favor with its own version of Events. Perhaps Instagram will be quick to follow suit, considering Facebook already has a popular model to build off.See a sneak peek at Snap event invites below…Snapchat is building Event InvitesSwipe up on a invite to join a group chat for the event pic.twitter.com/8yad1Ji6EI— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) June 7, 2019 Tech Juice eventsFacebookinstagraminvitessnapchatsocial mediaWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Bassnectar is in Denver this weekend for the annual Freestyle Sessions shows. Last night went off without a hitch as far as we know, with supporting sets from Joker, Reso, and Pushloop. Unfortunately, Bassnectar & his team are faced with an incredible challenge the rest of the weekend as their venue, First Bank Center, has suddenly and unexpectedly had to close for repairs.This afternoon, Bassnectar shared a statement with his fans that First Bank Center would be closed for the next week due to “a sudden and unexpected systems malfunction.” Even Bassnectar himself is taken aback by the news. He continues, “This is unprecedented and a complete shock to all of us, but they have informed us they cannot open their doors for tonight’s and tomorrow night’s events. We are currently brainstorming every possible solution – we realize how devastating this is, and how many of you have traveled so far and spent so much time and money and energy to be a part of this amazing weekend. Please stand by for further information as soon as we are able to provide it for you.”Tonight’s event was set to feature sets from J:Kenzo, The Librarian, and DJ Danny Corn while tomorrow had Shades, Phutureprimitive, and Thelem.At this time, Freestyle Sessions has not been “officially” cancelled.

"Swedish House Mafia were scheduled to headline the third and final night of Ultra Korea this weekend. Unfortunately, due to “unforeseen circumstances,” the trio has cancelled their performance. In a statement to fans, the group says, “They apologize to the fans and hope to perform in Korea soon.”Ultra Korea was one stop of many on SHM’s grand reunion tour which includes Creamfields, Ushuaïa, Ultra Europe and more. However, rumors are beginning to circle that the group is having internal troubles once again after this weekend.Separate from Ultra Korea, Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso were scheduled to perform together at XS Las Vegas on Friday night. Ingrosso never showed up for the set, and Angello played solo prompting fans to ask, “What happened to Ingrosso?!”Sources in Las Vegas tell Your EDM that Ingrosso never arrived, and in fact never got on his flight in Sweden. Meanwhile, those same sources say Steve Angello never departed Las Vegas, contributing to the group’s cancellation at Ultra Korea.Will Korea get the chance to see Swedish House Mafia again? Time will tell.This is the latest in a series of unfortunate events for international Ultra events. First, Ultra Singapore was forced indoors after its original venue was flooded, and then Martin Garrix was forced to cancel Ultra Korea after injuring his ankle in Las Vegas. While none of these are Ultra’s fault, it still regrettably reflects poorly on the brand.

It shows her and Twitch streamer iGumdrop walking quickly past a black man on the phone as he utters the n-word, not at them. As they get further away, far out of earshot or reach of the man, JVNA grabs her purse close to her chest, camera still on herself, and says, “Hold your purse! Hold your purse!” while smiling and laughing.Oh look, streamer @iGumdrop and @JVNA run away and laugh about ""clutching their purses"" when they walk past a black man on the phone. Hilarious @Twitch pic.twitter.com/XDBRnibFuS— #E3MODE (@LordBalvin) June 7, 2019Twitter and Reddit were quick to accuse JVNA of racism, based on the actions in the video, and many have called for a suspension or termination of both their Twitch accounts.In a statement exclusively provided to Your EDM, JVNA explains:Sure enough, by the time the man says anything in the video, JVNA and iGumdrop had already passed him and, as she says in her statement, never saw who it was. Was it appropriate that her first instinct was to run, based on the context in the video? And then to make a comment about holding her purse? Absolutely not. Do we know exactly what was going on in her mind at the time, either? Definitely not.Admittedly, this clip that paints them in a racist tone lacks context both before and after the offending statement. Was there some other individual that caused them alarm before, or did they recognize the toxicity of their behavior afterward?JVNA’s management tells Your EDM that a statement from both her, and another from iGumdrop, will be uploaded to Twitch soon. accusationsclipjvnaRacistTwitchLover of all bass music.

"Writing about this Sensu album since the first single dropped in April has been a bit of an eye opening experience. Rarely do I follow an album from a producer I’d never heard of track to track, but I find myself unable to stop listening and, more importantly, sharing her music with our followers.The new single “Issues” differs from the first two as it has a much lighter and less electronic feel to it. Additionally, rather than the sort of dark motifs presented by “Listen” and “Escape,” “Issues” feels more like a pleasant breeze — even at odds with its duplicitous title.Perhaps its the inclusion of more elements from hip hop or Asian themes; whatever it is, “Issues” is easily the most addictive of the singles out so far from .Sensu’s first full-length album  is slated to release on Friday, September 6.

"They don’t want DJ Khaled to be No. 1…Last month, DJ Khaled unleashed his album . It didn’t hit No. 1, which apparently set the producer and hitmaker off. Coming in at No. 2, the album gave into Tyler, The Creator‘s . Tough break, but understandable given the timing of both releases.According to , Khaled was pissed about how it went down. He reportedly “stormed into Epic with an entourage” — he was “angry and yelling” and “threw a temper tantrum.” The source also described him as “furious.”Another source mentioned a bundle deal with an unnamed energy drink. Khaled was apparently mad that  didn’t account for those record sales. He felt his label should have been fighting for a sum of 100,000 more copies sold.To the public, DJ Khaled comes off as an overly positive guy. If this report is true, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows — but still, this humanizes him in a way.Listen here and show Khaled some love!

"Two days ago, Matthew Koma let loose a scathing social media post accusing Zedd of a multitude of professional improprieties as well as a “toxic” and “self serving” personality. The post went viral with many people quickly jumping to his side of the story, with fewer people waiting for more information.Now, Zedd has finally responded to Koma, tangentially addressing the various accusations lobbied against him while still maintaining a relatively neutral position.“Matt, I am sorry you feel this way. I don’t feel the same, nor do I agree with your description of our history together,” Zedd says. “I supported you in every single area I had control over as I do with any and all of my collaborators.”He continued, “I will forever be grateful to you and your contributions to my career. I continue to wish you all the best.”I will forever be grateful to you and your contributions to my career. I continue to wish you all the best.— Zedd (@Zedd) June 7, 2019Whether this presents the end of this saga is up for debate, the ball is now in Koma’s court. As for Zedd, he’s managed to distance himself as much as safely possible from the accusations. Moving forward, he’ll likely think twice about omitting credit to someone from his team, as a precaution if nothing else. accusationallegationsApologymatthew komaresponsezeddLover of all bass music.

"When Porter Robinson announced earlier this week that his alias Virtual Self would be opening Second Sky Festival each day, fans were ecstatic. And then came the question, “Wait, during the day?” Much of Virtual Self’s impact comes from the intense lights during the show, so clearly the experience must be degraded in some way, right?Porter responded to a fan asking what type of set it would be, saying, “Definitely won’t be utopiasystem since that’s so lighting-heavy and it’ll be daylight. It’ll be a video-heavy DJ set and probably around 30~ minutes long to give full time to the other artists.definitely won’t be utopiasystem since that’s so lighting-heavy and it’ll be daylight. it’ll be a video-heavy dj set and probably around 30~ minutes long to give full time to the other artists— porter robinson (@porterrobinson) June 4, 2019Virtual Self is a huge draw for fans, no matter the set time, so plenty of fans who would have arrived later in the day will be at the festival early — this will also encourage them to check out other artists on the specifically curated lineup.In addition to this act of selflessness from Porter, proceeds from the event will go to benefit the Robinson Malawi Fund to combat a rare form of cancer called Burkitt lymphoma in Malawi.

"There are few other agencies as powerful in dance music as United Talent Agency and Paradigm. Windish and AM Only merged in 2017 to create Paradigm, and UTA acquired Circle Talent Agency in 2018. Between the two of them, most of dance music is present and accounted for. Now, according to a report from , these two juggernauts are in talks for a potential merger of their own.Sources confirmed to that UTA is the instigating partner in this deal, interested in either buying a controlling stake in Paradigm or merging the two companies.Writes , “the logistics of combining the two firms has been a challenge to getting a deal done — decisions about leadership of the music department are still being worked out. Gores has reportedly resisted an offer to break off and sell the company’s music divison, or share the CEO role and has never had a co-head of Paradigm in the more than 20 years he’s run the agency.“There’s also the issue of real estate — Paradigm recently moved into new offices on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, down the street from UTA’s Civic Center Drive offices — and questions about what to name the merged entity.”A brief overview of each agency’s artists:Whether this merger will go through or not will depend on a multitude of factors, but for the companies as a whole, it seems massively beneficial. For those vying for higher positions within the companies, a power struggle may erupt as a result.

"Porter Robinson played UMF Korea last night, both as his himself and his alias Virtual Self. However, there was never a Porter Robinson set scheduled at first. He was called in as a replacement for Martin Garrix who was supposed to headline the festival after he injured his ankle and cancelled all upcoming shows. Garrix told fans he needed surgery to prevent further injury, and expressed disappointment in having to cancel.However, Porter proved to be a fine replacement as he has a large fan base in Asia. And true to his character, Porter also played a tribute to Garrix at the festival, telling the crowd, “Hey, really quick. This one goes out to Martin Garrix. I promised Martin I would play one of his songs tonight. I really wish he could be here, shout out to all his fans.”He then went into an edit of Martin’s song “In The Name Of Love” with Bebe Rexha which left fans in awe and screaming their hearts out. It was a great way to honor Garrix in his absence and also stay true to his own sound.You can listen to Porter’s whole set from UMF Korea below — skip ahead to 49:00 for the tribute to Garrix. Rukes.com In the name of LoveMartin Garrixporter robinsonTributeultra koreaumf koreavirtual selfLover of all bass music.

"Diplo is an expert when it comes to throwing block parties and soon he’ll do it for a cause. For one of his upcoming bashes, dubbed as The Menagerie, the worldwide DJ/producer is giving back to the EDM community in a really big way.In partnership with The Midway in San Francisco, Diplo is bringing a single-day, four-stage block party to the city — all to raise funds for art and sound camps. Opulent Temple, Camp Questionmark, Root Society, and Duck Pond are among those being recognized at the event.Sound and art camps often provide experiences at music festivals that wouldn’t otherwise exist. Perhaps you’ve even stumbled upon one of these camps and thought to yourself — well isn’t this nice? Diplo has experienced some good times with these camps himself, as he seeks to raise money and help cultivate a more robust festival community.On Saturday, July 6th, The Menagerie goes down at Michigan and Marin Streets. The block party includes two outdoor stages, and an area for Burning Man frequenters — the Dancetronauts, Rynobus, and Bounce Art Cars.Phase one includes Diplo presenting “Higher Ground,” Mr. Carmack, Jonas Rathsman, Kenny Glassgow, Sharam, and Super Flu. Phase two has yet to be announced.Tickets and info here. art campsdiplosan franciscoSound Campsthe menagerieWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"“ONE. TWO. WOOP WOOP!”This chant was ubiquitous in the early 2010s, and still makes an appearance here and there these days. It’s from The Bloody Beetroots infamous “Warp 1.9,” featuring Steve Aoki, released on Dim Mak in 2009. The track’s history, and that sample in particular, has become party of the annals of dance music history and Dim Mak is doing a lot to celebrate its 10th anniversary. Having already released reissues of the track on digital and vinyl, it now gets a new revival from Steve Aoki and Kayzo as “Warp 2.019.”“Warp 2.019” premiered during Aoki’s Sunday night set at EDC Vegas, where he was joined on stage by The Bloody Beetroots and Kayzo to perform the remix live in front of thousands gathered at the circuitGrounds stage. The remix also marks the first official joint-production between Aoki and Kayzo, though they’ve teased more possible collaborations in the future.Whereas the original has a pounding electro rhythm, “Warp 2.019” borrows more from current bass music trends with a heavier drop more influenced by hard dance.Check out the new remix below! Buy & Stream: https://ffm.to/warp2019. 10 year anniversarydim makkayzoremixsteve aokithe bloody beetrootswarp 1.9warp 2.019Lover of all bass music.

"Approximately 14 months since Avicii passed away, his posthumous album is now out to the public. Featuring 12 new tracks and collaborations from Chris Martin of Coldplay, Bonn, A R I Z O N A, Imagine Dragons, Aloe Blacc and more, these are likely the final new Avicii tracks that the public will ever hear.Listening to  with that mindset is tragically bittersweet. After all, it’s always easy to implant your own interpretations on an artist’s music after they’ve passed, especially if they’ve taken their own life. (Think Chester Bennington’s music with Linkin Park.) That being said, much of  is incredibly bright and hopeful with uplifting melodies and powerful writing.Of course, the album didn’t turn out exactly as Avicii would have wanted, at least not one hundred percent. Most of the tracks on the album weren’t entirely finished at the time of his death, and were polished and completed based on directions he’d left behind by trusted production partners. It’s as close to the real Avicii as we’ll get, so we might as well throw out those thoughts of incompleteness out.Along with previously released singles “SOS” with Aloe Blacc and “Tough Love” with Agnes, Vargas & Lagola, fans also get “Heaven” with Chris Martin, “Hold The Line” with A R I Z O N A, and my personal favorite, “Heart Upon My Sleeve” with Imagine Dragons.At only 38 minutes, the album is over before you realize it and you’re left wanting so much more — another bittersweet realization at the end. 12 tracksalbumaloe blaccaviciiBittersweetChris MartinImagine DragonsposthumoustimLover of all bass music.

", the final album from Avicii, was released this past Thursday. Filled with twelve emotional songs, the entire listening experience took a lot out of me and made me think about the producer’s state of mind leading up to his final moments, or time in the studio.Now that I’ve had a chance to sit with it for a bit, I’m more comfortable listening all the way through without tearing up too much. I can also listen to the album in an entirely new way thanks to Proximity and visual media creatives The Pyramid Watch. Yesterday, Proximity premiered a full length music video to  that spanned the entire album and used custom animations for each song.With an additional visual element, the album takes on a new life. It could also be argued that it forces you to be more aware of the lyrics and elements of the music as you intentionally watch the lyrics appearing across the screen.Watch the album from Avicii below, courtesy of Proximity and The Pyramid Watch.  aviciiemotionalfull lengthlyric videoProximitytimLover of all bass music.

"First Denver, now Oakland. The city council in Oakland this week unanimously voted to decriminalize hallucinogenic fungi, otherwise known as “magic mushrooms” or “shrooms,” the active chemical in which is psilocybin.Pursuing leads related to magic mushrooms is hardly an effective use of police time, advocates of the resolution believe it will allow law enforcement to tackle higher-priority issues.Oakland councilman Loren Taylor added several amendments to the resolution offering guidance for users, which were accepted by the council.Writes , “They included suggestions that adults who chose to use hallucinogenic fungi begin with very small amounts so that they can see how they react before they use larger amounts. Another was that users seek expert guidance and consider having a trusted friend with them who is sober during their journey.” These are all tips that seasoned psychedelic users would give to first timers anyhow, emphasizing the knowledgeable decision from the city.The resolution was presented by Oakland City Council member Noel Gallo.“We have many mental challenges on our streets today, and it’s important to be able to freely provide whatever medicinal support we can, including the use of plants that have beneficial effects for thousands of years,” Gallo said.The FDA recently approved trials into psilocybin for depression, echoing Gallo’s statement. Hopefully Denver’s and Oakland’s decisions will influence other cities in the country much like moves to legalize cannabis have done. There are already efforts underway in Oregon to put the decriminalization of mushrooms on that state’s 2020 ballot. USA Today city councildecriminalizedmushroomsoaklandpsilocybinshroomsLover of all bass music.

"Ever since Diplo‘s notorious live stream of Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner‘s wedding, the back and forth between the couple and the producer has been somewhat of a media circus. Now, Diplo wants to set the record straight for good.Following the viral live stream, Joe Jonas publicly poked fun at Diplo in saying he uses the ‘gram “more than a 13-year-old.” Diplo later clapped back in saying the only thing that “ruined” the wedding was Jonas’s “fit.”In a more recent interview with Ryan Seacrest, Diplo opened up about the whole ordeal. Apparently the spontaneous nature of the ceremony led him to believe it wasn’t that “serious.” Jonas even called him up to apologize about how things got blown out of proportion.“I didn’t know it was a serious wedding,” he said. “I really didn’t know what was going on. I was hanging out with [Joe Jonas] after the Billboard Awards… and I was, like, ‘This is crazy. Let me record this.’ And there was mad people with cameras! I didn’t know I was, like, the only person recording this thing.”“I was talking to Joe today. There was a story that came out that he was, like, mad about me. He called me today to apologize,” he also explained while On Air with Ryan Seacrest. “Guess I’m ruining it now because I was going to continue to have beef with him. Pay attention to me and Jonas’ beef because I’m coming for him.”Maybe he could have left the dog filters out of it.

"Porter Robinson Will Replace Martin Garrix At Ultra Korea, Will Play Right After Virtual SelfEleven days ago, Martin Garrix injured himself jumping off the DJ booth at OMNIA in Las Vegas. (Let that be a lesson to the rest of you.) While it was initially believed to be only a minor sprain, something he could walk off, Garrix announced yesterday that he needed surgery and had to cancel all his upcoming shows, including an appearance at Ultra Korea.While we’re devastated about the news and wish Martin the speediest of recoveries, there’s a silver lining here. Porter Robinson has been named Garrix’s replacement at Ultra Korea, and that presents a very unique lineup: Porter Robinson will play after Virtual Self… who is also Porter Robinson.Very few artists are ever fortunate to have two aliases touring at the same time — only a couple examples come to mind, Clockwork and RL Grime, Eric Prydz and Cirez D, etc. It’s even more rare to have both your aliases play at the same event, and pretty much unheard of to have one follow the other on the lineup.Not to be too overdramatic, but this is literally history in the making.If you’re lucky enough to be going to Ultra Korea this weekend, you’re in for a very special treat!since @martingarrix won’t be able to play at ULTRA KOREA, i’m going to fill in for him with a Porter Robinson DJ set.… and because I was already on the lineup with my sideproject VIRTUAL SELF, that means I’ll be playing two completely different sets in a row on the mainstage!— porter robinson (@porterrobinson) June 6, 2019 Rukes.com aliasesfestivalhistoryInjurylineupMartin Garrixporter robinsonreplacementset timesultra koreavirtual selfLover of all bass music.

"After years of being abused by the media, The Chainsmokers have become much more selective in who they give their time to. The Zach Sang Show is one that they’ve been to before and have now visited again, and the long-format, unedited interview definitely presents Alex Pall and Drew Taggart in a way not usually depicted.Throughout the course of the 48-minute interview, a variety of topics get discussed from the Socratic method, to the band’s new live show (yes, I said band), to their new album , to their entrepreneurial ventures, and more.Of particular interest, TCS mention that  is just about halfway done (10:50). They’re constantly working on new tracks — but this also hints that many of the IDs they played at Ultra probably aren’t on the album. They could be putting out a remix album next year, though (19:55). It’s unclear if they’re talking about a traditional remix album in which others remix their songs, or if they’re putting out an album of all their own remixes.They go on to talk about outside ventures, like scoring a movie, a new live show, a “secret music project” and more (20:20). In addition to founding their own film/production company, they’re also making their own tequila brand now (27:15).As far as their new live tour with 5SOS coming later this year, The Chainsmokers reveal they’re “not even DJing on this upcoming tour.” Where Drew and Alex are concerned, with the addition of drummer and musical director Matt McGuire, they’re basically a band now (24:05).“We figured out a way to give people those dance moments but we don’t need to do it off of CDJs,” says Pall.“It’s in the same way that I wouldn’t consider Odesza, Flume, or Rufus du Sol to be DJs,” adds Taggart. “You’re not using CDJs; we’ll probably run our entire show through Ableton, where we’re queuing stuff, affecting stuff…”The whole interview is worth a watch and listen.

"It’s a big day for Avicii’s family and collaborators, as his posthumous album  is finally released. Featuring 10 never before heard tracks, not including the two singles already released from the album, is an unfettered insight into the musical mind of Avicii before his death last year.Ahead of the album release,  got in touch with many of his collaborators and contemporaries to speak to them about their time with Avicii, real name Tim Bergling.“The studio was as much a burnout for him as touring. I think the narrative may not be correct in that it was all touring that took him down,” said Geffen Records President Neil Jacobson. “If we didn’t have an end time for him, he would stay in the studio for 15 or 16 hours.”“When we met him, we could instantly tell that this was one of those mad geniuses,” said close friend Carl Falk. “I’ve only met a couple of people like Tim, who had this twisted way of making music in a way few people can understand.”“One thing I really admired about Tim was that he was never one to go, ‘I guess that’s good enough. Let’s move on.’ We had to find what we were searching for,” said British singer/songwriter Joe Janiak of Bergling’s process. “And because he was a perfectionist, maybe six hours after he finished something, he’d be like, ‘Actually, I’m not sure.’ Then eventually it was like, ‘Oh wait, no, that was right.’”Imagine Dragons’ Dan Reynolds discussed Bergling’s drive in a previously unreleased interview, “He knew what he wanted to hear. I remember singing melody after melody, like, ‘na na na na!’ and he would be like, ‘Hmm.’ Then I sang the melody that became ‘Heart Upon My Sleeve’ and his eyes lit up. He was like, ‘Yes!’”Recalls “Wake Me Up” vocalist Aloe Blacc, “When we performed at Ultra, it was just awkward. I don’t think even the sound people knew what they were doing. Everybody else at the festival had air cannons and pyro and half-naked girls dancing onstage. Then here comes Tim with drums, banjo, fiddle, guitar and three singers.”The  piece goes deeper into the motivations behind Bergling’s drive to produce, as well as the interactions his collaborators had with him before his death and with each other thereafter.

"Instagram today announced new options for adding music to your Stories, including the option to add dynamic lyrics.Just adding music by itself to your Instagram stories is a fairly recent innovation, launching less than a year ago. Since then, Instagram has expanded users’ options in how they share music, from sharing songs via Spotify and SoundCloud to adding them directly to the story as originally designed.“Music can be a big part of expression on Instagram – between adding music to Stories, connecting with artists, sending song recs back-and-forth, there are lots of ways to connect with music on IG,” a spokesperson from Instagram told . “Now, we’re building on our music features andintroducing the ability to add lyrics when you add a song to your story.”If you’re sharing a song with lyrics particularly meaningful to you — or just messing around — you can share those lyrics with your followers and help them to follow along. When adding a music sticker to your Story, you will be prompted to add lyrics (if you want) in a variety of styles and fonts to keep things fresh.Check out the video below to see it in action.Instagram just added improved music functions to stories, mostly focused on lyrics! pic.twitter.com/PHFodrFa5D— lucas s (@isthislucass) June 6, 2019 instagraminstagram lyricsinstagram storylyricsmusicsocial mediastickersstoriesLover of all bass music.

"Ultra Korea officially kicked off earlier today (Korea time), but not without its share of difficulties.Though attendees were incredibly excited to see NGHTMRE, Virtual Self, and Porter Robinson, the beginning of the day started off a bit rocky. Reports suggest that while doors were scheduled to open at 1pm, they were delayed until 3pm, disrupting sets from local openers on the main stage.The reason for the delay appears to be that the main stage still required additional construction (pictured below).Doors did eventually open and the festival thereafter reportedly went on as planned, with sets from all artists being enjoyed by tens of thousands.The same issues are not expected to be a factor tomorrow when Josh Pan, Zeds Dead, Knife Party, and Skrillex take the main stage.

"A couple of weekends ago, Martin Garrix was performing on stage when he suffered a terrible ankle injury. The DJ/producer pushed through most of his set, but ultimately left in an ambulance.Now, we’re learning the serious nature of the injury. To avoid making things worse, Garrix has been instructed by medical professionals to keep off his feet for the next four weeks. In turn, the touring act is being forced to cancel his upcoming gigs.Here’s the press statement, straight from his team:
Get well soon! Press Statement: Martin Garrix forced to cancel all shows coming weeks It is with deepest regrets that Martin Garrix has to announce that he is forced to cancel all his shows the coming weeks due to a serious ankle injury suffered during his show in Las Vegas on May 25th. Even though feeling positive after some days of rest, further examinations have determined that all his ankle ligaments are torn and surgery is needed to prevent permanent damage to his ankle. Therefore Garrix is forced to follow the specialist’s advice and cancel all his shows for at least the upcoming four weeks. Garrix: ’’I’m devastated that I have to cancel these shows since nothing makes me happier than performing for you guys. I feel most alive when I'm on stage, seeing you guys smile. I was really looking forward to it and I never want to disappoint my fans. Unfortunately this is out of my control and I will need a surgery and enough rest to fully recover. If I won’t get surgery now I might permanently damage my ankle, which could mean I won’t be able to perform at all anymore. I want to thank everyone for their continuous support and I hope to be able to get back on stage to perform for you guys again really soon.’’A post shared by  Martin Garrix (@martingarrix) on  Rukes.com ankle injurycanceledlas vegasMartin Garrixmartin garrix canceledmartin garrix tourshowstour",articles6,"['Martin Garrix', 'Martin Garrix', 'Martin Garrix', '’’A', 'Martin Garrix']"

"Dutch police are battling the production of ecstasy in a rather innovative way…Bottles of Xtacy, a perfume with packaging that resembles Chanel No. 5, have been circulated to police departments across the Netherlands. The idea is that consumers will approach their pop up booths to smell the fragrance. While it looks and sounds like a designer brand — it smells like actual MDMA.Its purpose isn’t to make the masses smell like the party drug, but rather to educate and help combat ecstasy labs and dumps of ecstasy waste. By offering up perfume samples on the streets, the OM and police are creating awareness and asking everyone to report signals of labs or dumps across the country. The most obvious signal being the aroma of MDMA.Dutch public prosecutor Antoinette Doedens made a statement along with the launch of this initiative — “smell is the most important way that people can recognize an ecstasy lab. That is why we want to spread the smell over the entire country so that everyone knows what to look out for.”With the production of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs, there always runs a risk of toxicity and gases, fire, or explosion, especially at an amateur level. Hazardous waste is also a huge problem, which can affect the health of people, animals and plants.Learn more here via OM. fragrancemdmaNetherlandsOMperfumepoliceXtacyWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Yesterday marked the 7th anniversary of “Spectrum” from Zedd and Matthew Koma, the song that arguably launched Zedd’s now illustrious career. For many, this song carries with it a beautiful memory of times gone by when dance music was perhaps more wholesome; or at least, progressive house was more prevalent.For Koma, however, the song carries with it a darker history of ego, toxic behavior, and a spectacular working relationship that could have been. In a series of slides, Koma describes the working environment with Zedd over the years, how Zedd allegedly took credit for his work, excluded him from events, and put on airs of professionalism when those behind the scenes apparently knew better.“I want to finally be transparent about this,” Koma begins. “It’s a really sad truth because I’m extremely proud of the work he and I did together… unfortunately my good feelings toward those songs have all but disappeared as they were experienced alongside someone so toxic and self serving that it occupied the space where any happiness could exist.”Koma describes Zedd as someone who had an inferiority complex at first. Then he describes how Zedd slowly and systematically “removed” him from the equation by taking credit for lyrics that Koma says he wrote alone, nor being paid for singing on “Spectrum” for 2 or 3 years. Koma even suggests Zedd is no longer involved in his own productions.Other stories of little toxic actions here and there spell out a longer history of this behavior, and paint a much different pciture of the man most of the dance music community believes to be wholesome.“For years I thought maybe it was me,” Koma reflected, “but over time, I’d run into other people who worked with him […] and the sentiment was shared. He’s the worst.”We’ve reached out to Zedd’s team for comment but have not heard back at time of publishing. We’ll update this article with any additional information provided.

"Porter Robinson Starts Fund In Honor Of His Brother Defeating CancerIn November 2016, Porter Robinson’s brother Mark was diagnosed with and hospitalized for a rare form of cancer called Burkitt lymphoma. Through a combination of specialist care, he went into remission in February 2017 and now lives cancer free (with regular check ups).Porter is taking the opportunity now as his debut festival Second Sky approaches to launch the Robinson Malawi Fund. He explains:Mark’s doctor, Dr. Westmoreland, will have a booth at Second Sky to share information and accept donations for this cause. Porter will match all donations made at the festival. In addition, Porter and Goldenvoice are donating one dollar from each ticket sale for the sold-out event, and the festival’s online live stream will also feature a way to make donations.If you’d like to get involved in supporting this cause, you can find more information here. You can see Porter Robinson and more at Second Sky in just a little over a week. in november of 2016, my then 17-year-old younger brother Mark was hospitalized with a rare and aggressive form of cancer called Burkitt lymphoma. he had a mass in his abdomen that was doubling in size every 24 hours. mark is pretty much my best friend – it was utterly devastating and one of the most difficult things i've ever been through (and surely a million times worse for him). through mark's own fortitude, and through the high quality of care from his doctors (Drs. Westmoreland & Hipps), nurses and staff at @UNCMedicine, i'm extremely happy to say that, as of February 2017 Mark finished his treatment and is now 100% cancer free and thriving. here's why i'm bringing this up: the survival rate for Burkitt lymphoma in the US is 90% or higher. but for kids in malawi, where it's much more common due to the connection between malaria and this form of cancer, the survival rate can be as low as about 29%. one of Mark’s doctors, Dr. Westmoreland, leads the pediatric cancer program that UNC operates in Malawi. i’m starting a fund in cooperation with UNC to help improve the survival rate in that region so that those families won't have to needlessly lose loved ones. in this case, more resources translates directly into higher survival rates. Second Sky (@secondskyfest) is going to have a booth (with Mark's doctor there!) to share information and accept donations for this cause — we have a goal to raise $50,000 (or hopefully higher) and i'm going to match everyone's donations at the festival! if you’d like to get involved in supporting this cause, you can find more information here (also the link in my bio): www.robinsonmalawifund.orgA post shared by  porter robinson (@porterrobinson) on  Rukes.com brotherBurkitt lymphomacancerMark Robinsonporter robinsonremissionrobinson malawi fundSecond SkyLover of all bass music.

"Being responsible with drugs at a music festival is not some new directive. For years now, in some cases decades, organizations like DanceSafe and Bunk Police, as well as other private festivals and individuals, have made drug education and safety a top priority. Beyond testing your drugs to know what it is you’re taking, measuring out correct dosages is equally important. Doing 20 tabs of LSD is simply not responsible.One man named Pete Townshend braved the unknown and took approximately 2mg of LSD (20 tabs) at an event this past weekend put on my Kosmic Events. A normal dose is anywhere from 1-4 tabs (100-400μg), though individuals have been known to push the limits when it comes to psychedelics.pic.twitter.com/DydbyPJcnR— Pete townshend (@humantestkit) June 2, 2019In response to this reckless act, festival owner Daniel Green publicly banned Townshend from all his events. “We have your full legal name and pictures and if you come onto the property next year you will be arrested immediately,” he said on Twitter.@humantestkit You will not be allowed at kosmic events in the future. This is just brutally irresponsible. We have your full legal name and pictures and if you come onto the property next year you will be arrested immediately— Daniel Green (@SUB_ChaosDUB) June 3, 2019Some felt that his response was an overreaction, or not in the spirit of the community. Green disagreed.I sound like the owner of a festival who had a to deal with a dumb ass on 20 hits of acid.— Daniel Green (@SUB_ChaosDUB) June 3, 2019He bothered plenty of people. He was a nightmare to deal with. And then he came back again at 3am and caused more problems.— Daniel Green (@SUB_ChaosDUB) June 3, 2019Townshend, to his credit, understood where Green was coming from and was fine with being made an example of. (Note: Townshend says 16 tabs in the tweet below, but later admitted he had miscounted.) Moral of the story: be responsible with your drugs, or else you could become an example for others of what not to do.Never take 16 tabs in a public setting guys.

"Apple revealed much yesterday in its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, including the “end” of iTunes as we know it, upgrades to the iPad and Apple Watch, and the new $5,999 Mac Pro. However, as has become tradition with Apple, much of its price points left consumers and tech advocates either in shock or, as you’ll see in the video below, straight up laughing.Along with the Mac Pro, Apple announced a separate $4,999 Pro Display XDR. It’s a beautiful display, to be certain, boasting a 6K resolution, up to 1600 nits of brightness, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, and superwide viewing angle. But Mac Pro users will find it difficult to use this display without a stand — one is not provided in the box with the display.Instead, consumers will either have to purchase a $199 VESA mount adapter (a fancy phrase for a wall mount) or the $999 Pro Stand, which  dubs “the priciest dongle of all time.”Watch the video below to see and hear the crowd reaction when the presenter reveals the price of the stand. Though he keeps speaking, somewhat obscuring the sound, laughter from the crowd is clearly audible and actually manages to stop the presenter in his tracks for a few moments before finishing his pitch.  $999accessoryApplecrowd reactiondongleExpensivehardwareinsane priceMac Propro standsold separatelywwdcLover of all bass music.

Ultra Singapore has been relocated from ULTRA Park to B2 Sands Expo and Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands.Find the full statement here.While Ultra in Miami is dealing with its own host of issues, one of Ultra’s international events might not be happening at all. Rumors are now circulating that Ultra Singapore is woefully under-prepared for their event this weekend and tickets still have yet to be sent out to attendees.One of the main pieces of alleged evidence driving the rumors is a supposed message being circulated on social media, shared with MS News (right). There’s no sender or recipient attached to the image, but it accuses the owner of Ultra Singapore, Alex Chew, of “years of fraudulent business practices.”(Ultra routinely works with local promoters for its international events.)According to the message, a litany of pending lawsuits, lack of permits, and general mismanagement have kept Ultra Singapore from operating on schedule.“Alex is misleading the public into believing that Ultra will happen in 5 days,” the message reads. “We need to get the word out to everyone to demand transparency and refunds.”Furthermore, it’s also being alleged that construction on the stage was halted over a week ago for reasons unknown.Attendees received emails stating that they would e-ticket and wristband redemption information today, June 3.

"Major Lazer is ushering in “a new era of lazer” ahead of the group’s 4th and supposed final album… but it won’t be with Jillionaire. The longtime member of the group has reportedly parted ways with Diplo and Walshy Fire to pursue solo projects, to be replaced by Ape Drums.The departure began to become apparent when his name was continuously left out of promotional materials.

"One of the biggest tech rumors of the past year has finally been officially confirmed today at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California. Apple announced that iTunes will be replaced by a trio of desktop apps called Music, TV, and Podcasts.This rumor has been all but heard from the horse’s mouth for the past couple months, but it’s good to finally hear it for real. During the conference in which Apple showed off its next-gen tech and software, the news about iTunes was not a shock to most, and opened up strategies for growth, as well.“For Apple’s own business, it marks the strategic shift away from a central hardware focus to a business in which subscription content and services are increasingly important for margin and revenues,” said Kent, referencing the iPhone’s sluggish sales.Thankfully, Apple isn’t just throwing all your downloads and purchases to the wind, either. Previous purchases and libraries will be maintained in each new app on Mac computers, a spokesperson told .“Building a bridge is always important in order to not alienate its current user base, but I’d argue that it has already taken that step considering the Apple Music numbers,” said Ramon Llamas of IDC Research. “Clearly, it needs to direct people in that direction and show a clear cut-off date so that users are prepared.”The next step will be in rolling out ways to access and manage past content via the trio of apps. As of right now, iTunes is still available to download. The rollout of the app trio will likely occur over the course of the next few months.

Evidence of a supposed text exchange and little to no progress on the stages at the venue suggested credence to the rumors, though no party involved in the event had made any official statement one way or another.This morning, an official statement from ULTRA Singapore promises the event will go on, and apologizes for not updating fans sooner.

"2019 is a big year for Diplo. He’s released an album with Labrinth and Sia under LSD, he’s producing a new Mad Decent festival in Foxborough, MA, he’s working with Mark Ronson on Silk City, he’s played both Coachella and Stagecoach, and he might be putting out the final album as Major Lazer.With regards to Major Lazer, the trio has been touring festivals and working on new music, but some believed that Jillionaire had left the group as he was being mentioned less on ML socials. At the same time, it was rumored that he’d been replaced by Ape Drums. In response to rumors yesterday, Diplo told today,“Jillionaire is always part of the team. Ape Drums is helping with production on some tracks (he’s done a few songs with us before) so he is going to tour with us as well…it’s like John Mayer joining the Grateful Dead.”So, at least that’s cleared up — still, the extent of Jillionaire’s involvement with the group this year is a matter of interpretation. As we await Major Lazer’s fourth and supposed final album, listen to their latest single “Can’t Take It From Me” with Skip Marley below. Dancing Astronaut ape drumsclarificationcleared updiplofinal albumjillionairemajor lazerrumorLover of all bass music.

But next year, Primavera will make its official US debut in a city where it’s always primavera (“spring” in Spanish): Los Angeles.Primavera Sound Los Angeles will debut at the Los Angeles State Historic Park on September 19-20, 2020.

"The second memoir from Moby entitled  has ruffled a lot of feathers since its release…Now, he’s backing away from promo as his website claims the musician and author “is canceling all upcoming public appearances for the foreseeable future.” With this, Moby has officially nixed the British leg of his book tour.The outrageous snapshot from the DJ/producer covers everything from a highly inappropriate, drunken run-in with Donald Trump to his friendly involvement with Natalie Portman, hooking up with Christina Ricci and dating Lana Del Rey. Absolutely nothing was off limits.Recently, Portman called Moby out for saying they “dated.” A time which she described more like “a much older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school.” He did, ultimately, issue a sincere apology owning up to his actions.In an Instagram update titled “las post,” Moby writes: I’m going to go away for awhile. But before I do I want to apologize again, and to say clearly that all of this has been my own fault. I am the one who released the book without showing it to the people I wrote about. I’m the one who posted defensively and arrogantly. I’m the one who behaved inconsiderately and disrespectfully, both in 2019 and in 1999. There is obviously no one else to blame but me.

"Actors, directors, and filmmakers often use real life subjects as inspirations for their works. Characters like Moe from The Simpsons, Kramer from Seinfeld, even Nacho Libre had real life inspirations. In Elijah Wood’s new role as a DJ and self-proclaimed music business mover-and-shaker in the film , director Ant Timpson revealed he wanted the actor to emulate producer/DJ Skrillex.“When Ant sent me the script, it came with a photo of Skrillex,” said Wood. “No joke. He was like, ‘This is kind of what I’m imagining.’ And I was like, Oh, f—, he must be kidding. Skrillex is fine. [But] his look is more extreme. I was like, ‘Oh s—, that is what he has in his head.’ And as we got into production, actually, his ideas got crazier. Like, Skrillex was  in comparison. So, the costume design stuff, and the hair, and all of that, that was really a collaboration. I was like, ‘He has to be human, we have to relate to him on some level. He can’t be a total alien.’” follows Wood’s character in the film, Norval, as he visits his father (Stephen McHattie) for the first time since the latter abandoned him and his mother decades previously. As you can see in the clip below, the look Wood ended up going with is far more extreme than the Skrillex inspiration he was given.The film released to theaters earlier this year. EW come to daddyElijah WoodinspirationmovieskrillexLover of all bass music.

"Apple Is Officially Shutting Down iTunes, Teases What’s NextLots of changes are coming to the Apple ecosystem in the coming years, some sooner than others. We’ve already reported on the end of iTunes, and how the tech juggernaut is developing a trio of apps — Music, TV, and Podcasts — to replace it. But Apple isn’t just iPhones and it’s not just iTunes, and it’s trying to remind its users of that fact.Apple CEO Tim Cook and other leaders will make a keynote presentation at the Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California this coming week to unveil updates of Apple’s operating systems and a new approach to apps altogether.A lot of the changes will be coming to Apple’s other most successful pieces of hardware: the watch and iPad.For the watch, Apple wants to make it a more independent device with apps like a calculator and voice recorder, and new messaging features. It already took steps in that direction two years ago by adding cellular connectivity, but Cook & co. want to do more.As for the iPad, Apple wants to continue pushing the “iPad as a laptop” idea with better software and more third-party compatibility. Writes , “The company plans enhancements to the home screen and new features around using multiple apps at once to help the iPad satisfy more of your computing needs.”New apps, exploration into augmented reality, and a new focus on health are just some of the other topics expected from WWDC this week. Bloomberg AppleAppsFutureIpadiphonetechupdatewatchLover of all bass music.

"Back in April, the fantastic Australian electro-indie band Gold Fields made their exciting return with a brand new album, 'Dalawa' - a nine-track LP that sees the group take a step back from their typical indie-pop sounds and dive headfirst into a more vintage, psychedelic and electronic sound.Following the release of her epic 'Waves & Whirlwinds' EP at the end of last year - along with all the brilliant work she's put together under her Nocturnal Sunshine moniker - Maya Jane Coles has offered up her talents to the Aussie band for a remix of their album cut, 'Cocoon'. Her weighted rework of the track is a sly and harmonic combination of pumping deep house and the blazingly catchy lyricism of Gold Fields' original composition. The quick tempo and shadowy electronic adornments make it the perfect track for a cinematic adventure through clubland.“I really enjoyed working on this track,"" Maya Jane Coles said commenting on her remix. ""It turned into something very different to everything else I’ve done in the remix department, but super happy with the outcome.”Ahead of its release on June 21 via Haven Sounds, Maya Jane Coles has handed over the luxurious remix for a premiere.

"As the world tumbles towards dystopia, multi-disciplinary artist Jessika Khazrik believes in the power of music to tackle global oppressionJessika Khazrik, an artist, electronic musician, technologist, and writer, was born in Beirut to a Lebanese mother and an Armenian-Iraqi father in 1991, just after the end of the Lebanese civil war in 1990. The war left in its wake a legacy of destruction on major infrastructure and a shake-up to social and ecological stratification that the country is still, to this day, struggling to change.“My memories were born before I was born, but there is much more to delve into in Beirut besides war and post-memory,” says Jessika.Jessika grew up listening to jazz music at her father’s piano bar in Beirut, before forging ahead onto heavier tonics, such as metal, tarab and Arabic baladi, EBM, IDM, and eventually Detroit techno.At the age of nine, Jessika began using the internet, and that lit the touch papers for an obsession with technology, a fixation which remains a persistent strand both physically and thematically throughout Jessika’s work: her productions, performances and DJ sets use a variety of tools from machine-learning to voice coding and encryption.Beirut’s nightlife is notorious worldwide, coupled with an unwavering lust for partying among the Lebanese which is unparalleled elsewhere. But the dominant sound inside clubs is still European-centric deep house and techno, and because of this, real innovators can find themselves siloed. Demand for their less conventional sounds is often more popular abroad than it is locally.Notwithstanding various reasons for scepticism, she thinks the world has a lot it could learn from Beirut - a city which, 30 years after the civil war, still does not have 24-hour electricity. Despite her love-hate relationship with Beirut which Jessika describes as “almost abusive at some points”, the city features heavily in her work as an inspiring focal point. One example of this is the use of samples from her dystopian surroundings to demonstrate wider philosophical arguments about global economy.“While walking in the city, I used to follow and record the sound of private electricity generators, which I feel is an example of the privatisation you have now in Beirut, and which creates more exclusionary zones instead of inclusionary zones,” she says.But Jessika doesn’t confine herself to just one label as a Lebanese artist. Her work tackles the big themes which are relevant worldwide and symptomatic of the age we live in: disruption, technology, toxicity, gender, and our confused perceptions of identity. Her work is multi-disciplinary, using a variety of mediums to communicate with communities around the world and engage in debates about the future of the internet and surveillance. As a result, Jessika’s electronic soundscapes have been showcased across the world, not only in clubs, but in non-musical contexts from Poland to Shanghai.Evident from all our conversations is her strong belief in the potential for techno to bridge a looming gap between the clubbing context and everyday life. According to Jessika, music has a claim to universalism which could challenge new oppressions that we face in the digital age.Techno, she says, is gaining more and more traction as we seek to make sense of our increasingly chaotic global environments and tumble towards dystopia. Jessika is driving forward the conversation on what kind of future we want to create for ourselves, and she advocates that electronic music could have a big role to play in that new reality.Discover more in Jessika Khazrik's Impact mix and Q+A below.You mentioned that you began using the internet when you were nine, and you have strong views on how artificial intelligence is changing the way we consume and produce music. What is the role of the internet in your work?On many levels, the internet is my school. Cyberspace is older than the internet itself and for me it’s a place where I am in touch with different producers from all over the world. But the category of the user disturbs me because the internet is so chaotic and also full of standardisation.We need new forms of knowledge that go beyond the user. With the internet and machine-learning, we are going forward with these dichotomies that we worked hard to undo. For example, we can see this with the way some strands of machine learning are going forward, reinforcing reductionist social categories like Male and Female and targeting audiences based on these outdated premises that they can mimic. Certain interactions that used to be within the field of law, such as verification and authentication are now more so becoming part of everyday life, and it seems that opacity is something we have to fight for.An issue with AI is that idea of assassination of the artist. How do you marry being pro-AI with communicating ideas that you want to address through your work?Of course, there’s all these ideas around the future and the death of the DJ, but for me it will always be a collaboration between humans or whatever we may be and machines. I’m very interested in making visible these decisions, but also playing between the voice and code. We live in a time of crisis, and there is an anxiety that is being experienced now, not just in individuals but in the way that society is run. There’s always a strand in my work around not wanting to be recognised by systems of classification.Are there contexts you encounter which feel oppressive or limiting to your identity?There is a tendency when your work is deeply embedded in technology to encounter condescending attitudes. There is this maybe learned behaviour of men to feel daunted when working in areas that they know nothing about. I’m very happy that there is a lot of conversation on gender now, and that we are realising the importance of booking a diversity of people. I do not identify even with one identity, such as being a woman. I have a wide frame of reference and I’m always trying to work with the idea that we are working to contain everything. I am more interested in disidentification than identity itself.You told me that parts of Beirut that are situated on top of toxic waste grounds. Because of this, they have to be used as temporary spaces, which are often nightclubs. Can you expand on why this intriguing fact is so prevalent in your work?I first started looking into this in 2013 when I found out that toxic waste was dumped in two of the places north of Beirut where I used to hang out with friends and play music. I did a piece of work on this subject called ‘Mount Mount Refuse’, that I showed first here in Beirut, then the Museum of Modern Art in Warsaw, and at the Arsenic Theatre during Les Urbaines festival in Switzerland.In my research I found that when Beirut was reconstructed [after the Lebanese civil war] there was this whole privatisation of the city centre. From 1993, there were legal toxicologists and scientists who said [land in Beirut’s city centre] cannot be used for buildings, for sure not for 25 years. There was this whole dispute, and now this land can only hold temporary structures, and what you have there is mostly clubs.The space that is in between construction and disuse is very central to transformation. Though I’m born supposedly when the civil war ended, I have second-hand memories and different experiences related to that because I was born into a space that was in contested transformation. In Mount Mount Refuse, I try to bring together these promises of deconstruction and how we experience this in the self and in cyber-space. I think the environment and the self are very intertwined.It's incredible when you think about it as a concept; that Beirut’s infamous nightlife scene is built literally on a pile of trash.It’s really telling and shows something that I’m always trying to resist in my work: that the relations and the security that are created from club culture should not be temporary.The scene [in Beirut] channels politics that you see elsewhere, like there’s not a lot of female representation, and clubs are often not inclusive of the queer community. I’m really interested in dance music scenes emerging in Asia and south east Asia. I played last year in Shanghai and it’s really interesting the sound that is emerging over there and there’s a lot of room for that to be played here. I still feel that if you look at the line-ups [in Beirut] it’s very euro-centric.You really took this issue with the idea of Beirut as a haven. All the financial indicators seem to point to Lebanon being on the brink of collapse. Do you think it says something that this hasn’t resulted in mobilising people for change? Quite the opposite - they choose to party, heavily.Which you had even during the war. My father was very much part of that during the war, where there were new scenes created around the suburbs or in northern cities because certain spaces became unsafe, so there was a new market [for nightlife]. There is a really high rate of unemployment. I have the privilege of working as a technologist, platform designer and artist and I can make a living through this multiplicity that deeply interests me. But in reality if you are just working in producing electronic music, there are very few channels of scattered support. It’s always when you are travelling people say ‘oh the music is amazing in Beirut’, and it’s true that there are amazing producers here, but they often have to leave and play more abroad than they do in Beirut.There is an interview with Jeff Mills where he talks about techno as a means of exploring the future, and that our use of techno at the moment is very limited and possibly oppressive. He suggests that using techno as an escape and using it to progress are two different things.Yeah, there’s a really nice interview with Aïsha Devi, and she says that for her the club is not the place where one loses oneself but where one finds themselves. I think that’s why it’s very important that club spaces are not just temporary spaces, and that we let what happens in the club permeate into everyday life, breaking the boundaries on what can be permitted or performed. That's why I can never be confined to one space and I don’t want to be contained. I think these questions are very accepted within the artistic framework but they need to leak into other spaces, because clearly what we have today is not only an economic crisis but also a crisis of the imagination.Can you talk us through your Impact mix?In this mix I tried to channel a living stratification of garbage, music, history, technology, thoughts and desire. While continuing to explore new forms of machine translation between media that machine learning and current understandings of AI are putting forward, I mixed my tracks without pre-cuing with headphones – I just used and paced with the wave’s visual form and progression. It’s all mixed on four decks with in and off-club dance music practices I’ve encountered locally, regionally and worldwide. I hope you enjoy it!Tracklist:Bjarki - Happy Screams [!K7 Records]

"The Russian techno duo serves up a robotic array of intrepid soundsAs the frenetic and indomitable sounds of Russian techno duo PTU reaches new heights with the much-anticipated arrival of their debut album 'Am I Who I Am' on Nina Kraviz' Трип (Trip) imprint, the pair reveals the intoxicating power of their unique style with a bold In Session mix.A duo that has never given up on their desire to craft their own wonderfully uncanny aesthetic, Alina Izolenta and Kamil Ea of PTU started their sonic adventure over a few impromptu synth sessions with friends in the early 2000s. Swapping music via their coveted hard drives, tape copies and pirate CDs with badly printed covers, the pair found a reflective musical awakening in one-another that has continued to evolve for well over a decade.PTU stands for Professional Technical Schools, a type of vocational education facility established in the former Soviet Union to train various industrial workers and servicemen who could not afford to study at university. Having both been born in the Soviet Union and raised in Siberia after it's subsequent fall, their moniker is meant to serve as a reminder of their Russian roots that pays homage to the formal education they received, which has, in turn, guided their epic and creative journey into clubland.Kamil and Alina got their big break in 2016 when Nina Kraviz reached out to them via Facebook and requested material. She subsequently asked PTU to sign to her Трип label. They have become an integral part of the label's output, releasing adventurous singles like 'Yes' and EPs such as 'A Broken Clock Is Right Twice A Day' that have assisted in cultivating Трип's forward-thinking acumen.PTU's 12-track debut album 'Am I Who I Am' is a formless and frenzied display of techno that is full of surprises at every turn. The freeform exploration that echos throughout the LP gives off a feeling that Kamil and Alina are ""awakening an army of malfunctioning robots"" as they march into the future - armed with high-velocity drums, gyrating acid leads and a sensible amount of sonic restraint. All in all, it's a thrilling voyage into techno’s strangest sector.All the more thrilling is the duo's high-octane mix for our In Session series. With its unforgiving aura and fast-paced persona, this cold-blooded hour of high energy excellence has an uncommon physicality to it that will transport your mind to the dancefloor's most outlandish recesses.PTU's 'Am I Who I Am' arrives on June 24 via Трип.Cameron is Mixmag's Jr. Editor.

"The multi-faceted artist and Dusk & Haze label boss is relentlessly pushing the boundariesHighly-atmospheric vibrations, intricate break patterns and dark undertones have become the deserved cornerstones of the rising talent Sophia Saze.Following her upbringing in Tbilsi, Georgia, the bedrock of Brooklyn is where Saze has laid her roots. She has a wildly impressive range, from big-room industrial techno to minimally ambient soundscapes. In 2017 she launched her record label, Dusk & Haze, where she debuted her LP 'Solace' as the label's first release. Saze also had a release on Get Physical, with her track 'Fall' appearing on the label's Words Don't Come Easy compilation.Since then, Saze has emerged as one of the premier techno producers in New York, bringing a progressive edge to any dungeon dance floor. As she continues to rise through the underground, Mixmag caught up with her to reveal her unique approach to dance music and DJing.Scope an exclusive mix by Sophia Saze, where she drops a staggering 56 tracks in 56 minutes, along with a Q+A and track list below:What are some of the early electronic records that made a serious impact on your sound? When did you start diving into the world of electronic music?My musical evolution is different from most DJs. I didn't get into electronic music by going to parties, nor by DJing. I first started by producing and wanting to understand how to write all of my favorite tracks. That was my initial driving force and still is. I started familiarizing myself with the genre during high school in Philadelphia. There were these flea markets and I'd spend weekends picking up random CDs. I'd become obsessed with an artist and dig into ripping the rest of their work online. I still tend to do the same today. I'll get sucked into someone and latch onto burning through their entire discography.My first few influences were straight classics, Massive Attack, Boards Of Canada, Chemical Brothers, Aphex Twin. I was religiously following the work of Miss Kittin and The Hacker. I remember being 15, hearing her voice on a track for the first time at this older nightclub in Tbilisi, Night Office. I was searching for it avidly, 'Madame Hollywood'. I definitely stepped in from a broader angle, and as my depth evolved my preferences became more particular.At some point, I started listening to artists like Autechre, Dopplereffekt and Squarepusher. Dopplereffekt 'Gesamtkunstwerk' is probably one of my all time favorite electronic albums. I'm attached to almost anything out on Warp. Aphex 'Windowlicker', I don't care if that's not heady or deep enough because it is by far my favorite track ever made. I got into club dance music in my university years, particularly house in the vein of Chicago. Phuture 'Acid Trax, Model 500 'Night Drive', Derrick May 'Icon'. I began following a lot of IDM also, like Brian Eno and Global Communication. Thom Yorke, I guess he's my all time hero in terms of a figure who epitomizes the true essence and natural core of artistry. Drexciya 'The Quest' always blew my mind. Royksopp 'What Else Is There' is probably the one that hooked me.How did you first get into DJing and producing? Can you tell us a little about your first music project?I didn't start as a DJ. My ex-boyfriend in college gave me a copy of Logic 9. I wanted to learn how to record my classical piano stuff at first. Coincidentally, I started going out a lot more during that time, especially upon moving up to New York. I began producing and releasing music under various aliases. I prefer not to talk about those projects now just because so much of it should've been quality controlled, but there's no shame in learning. Eventually a friend of mine told me that in order to push myself further in electronic music, I would have to learn how to DJ. Huge shoutout to the homie Misha. He invited me to this after hours in, Beef Cuts. It was the most disgusting place and I loved it. That spot was the foundation of me becoming a DJ.You've been running your Dusk & Hazer label for the past few years now. What is the vision behind the label? What is the music you aim to showcase?It'll be 2 years this fall, as we were only promoting events until then. The concept is to create a platform for a wide array of projects stylistically. I don't want to showcase one strain of music and I'm completely turned off by linear work. That may suit other labels but not us. I'm fairly extreme but in an off-kilter sense, definitely not a purist either. Whatever the weirdest music in your catalog is, the things you're not comfortable sharing with the rest of the world, that's the stuff that interests me most.You are originally from Tbilisi, Georgia but later lived in NYC, what attracted to you to the city and what are your thoughts on the dance music community there?I was always fascinated by New York. It's so appealing at first, the flashing lights and energy, but eventually realized it's also a rabbit hole that was looping me in circles. I moved out recently because it became too overwhelming. I still think it's the best city in the world but my heart just wasn't there anymore. I couldn't sustain. I originally moved there for work, left my day job and pursued music. It was different back then though, this was 2011/2012. There were warehouse parties and now it's mainly clubs operating, which isn't my comfort zone. I started out in warehouses. I can't wrap my head around having fun in a night club, regardless of how nice it is. From the start of the night you already know what to expect which completely kills any level of mystery. I enjoy going back to the city to play once in awhile, I'm grateful of course for any opportunity, but also feel it's important to scale naturally. What's most frightening about the city and underground music overall right now is how fast everything is moving, in all the wrong commercialized directions. Slow down guys, what's the rush and why is everyone so desperate for attention, what's your motive?Tell me about your approach to this Impact Mix. What did you aim to showcase?Firstly, I wanted to step away from what was expected of me, which is that this would be a banging techno mix. I wanted to experiment with a wide display of era, producers and tracks. I also aimed to clarify that intensity isn't a priority. There's such a misunderstanding at the moment, DJs confusing quality with straight hard music and harder truly just isn't better. I wanted to stay dynamic and I think this mix captures my intention and current mindset. Technically, I've been pushing myself into faster and sharper mixing too. I decided on this one to go with 56 tracks in 56 mins. I wanted to expand on the format as well, this mix was recorded with two CDJs and two turntables at my home in Philadelphia.What's coming up next for you?I usually have so many plans but for the first time, I don't know. My album is about to drop on Francis Harris' Kingdoms imprint and I have a few other newer releases planned for both my project and my label as well, Dusk & Haze. There's a lot happening which is exciting but my life could also go in any direction right now. My only priority is to keep happiness in check, without that nothing is worth living for. Music is an incredible journey but it's important to not lose my integrity in the process or attach any of it to my personal value. It's all just a party at the end, when the lights go out.TRACKLIST01) Shady P - Unreleased

"Powered byAn hour of power from a producer who's owned the decade in drum 'n' bassHalogenix has taken this decade in d'n'b by storm, releasing on scene lynchpins like Critical, Metalheadz, 1985 and Dispatch. It's high time he blessed our In Session series.Intriguingly, Halogenix didn’t begin his career in the most conventional manner. His father is a classically-trained French horn player for the London Symphony Orchestra, and as a result sparked his interest in classical theory and the study of instruments. A schoolboy obsession with tagging the word ‘Halogen’ across his chemistry textbook lead to coming up with the Halogenix alias and the rest is 170bpm history.2011 saw the start of a thriving career in low-end electronic music. Shortly after releasing his first tracks, Halogenix collaborated with Sabre and Stray on 'Askari', and the three joined forces to become the phenomenal bass-heavy force Ivy Lab. The trio blessed the scene with cult hits including ‘Oblique’, featuring Frank H Carter III’s soulful vocals, and even landed themselves a spot in Mixmag’s Top 10 DJs of 2015. His time in Ivy Lab continued until 2018, when he left the group to focus totally on his solo work, but not after collaborating with Roses Gabor and SHADES as part of the group.2015 was also the year of Halogenix’s debut EP with Metalheadz, with lead on to a collaboration with label boss Goldie. A high point of his work for the label came when his track ‘Blej’ recieved a Best Track nomination at the 2017 Drum & Bass Arena Awards.Since then, Halogenix has continued his extensive musical backlog, including creating this mix. It's full of twists and turns, from intimate vocals over punchy, energetic beats to moody, dark and industrial vibes. It’s impossible not to move your body to this one and it lands just before the release of his latest EP, 'Gaslight', on Critical.“I like to keep my sets dynamic and varied with a future facing feel as well as a nod to it’s rich past,"" he says of the mix. ""It’s the same philosophy I adopt when I make music — mixing the light with the dark — if i stick to one style for too long i just end up getting bored.”Halogenix's 'Gaslight' EP is out on June 7 via Critical MusicBekka Barnard is a freelance writer, follow her on Twitter",articles7,"['Dispatch', 'Sabre', 'Frank H Carter III’s', 'Roses Gabor', 'SHADES']"
"French producer Lil Fish is shaking things up in IDM, perfectly mixing elements of trap, trip hop and dub to create unique beats. His new single with fellow French artist CloZee is a shining example of this sound.“The Lost Voices” is a beautiful blend of ethnic influence and modern IDM. The use of interesting percussion and Eastern vocal samples gives the song an organic sound, not overproduced in the slightest. It serves as a showing of what these two producers do best.Inspired by artists like Boards of Canada, Flying Lotus, and Bonobo, Lil Fish wears his influences on his sleeve but still succeeds in creating his own signature on each track. “The Lost Voices” is the first single from his upcoming EP, Organic, set to be released later this year.

"After debuting it at EDC Las Vegas last month, REZZ gives one of her most highly anticipated tracks to date an official release.The Canadian producer takes her increasingly successful career to the next level by teaming up with UNDERØATH’s Aaron Gillespie on “Falling.” The track, which comes paired alongside a visually dynamic music video, showcases a darker side of the multifaceted artist – if that was even possible.Slow-paced piano melodies interlace with Gillespie’s iconic yearning vocals, creating an ambience that pairs seamlessly with the music video’s grungy and horror-inspired aesthetic. The video offers viewers a chance to escape reality and view the world from Gillespie’s perspective, hinting at the virtual reality worlds that will accompany each song on the forthcoming Beyond The Senses EP from REZZ.“The concept we landed on is essentially about using VR as a metaphor for being trapped in your own negative, depressive, or anxious thoughts, which can ultimately be self-destructive.” – Colin G Cooper, DirectorWatch the video for “Falling” here:“I grew up listening to Underoath,” says REZZ. “Working with Aaron was so fun and effortless. It was great to revisit some of what I consider my earliest musical inspiration.”“Falling” comes ahead of REZZ’s forthcoming Beyond The Senses EP, out 7/24 through AWAL.

"Trap music kings GTA are known for electrifying live sets that show off their skills behind the mix, as well as some pretty massive ID’s. There’s one fan favorite in particular that’s been popping up in sets since way back in 2017, one of their own ID productions that never received an official release – until now. “FK IT” is finally getting the official release it deserves, and the official version lives up to everything we had hoped.This Mad Decent release begins with a high-energy intro that hypes up the signature fun trap drop, accented perfectly by some well-placed horn samples that give the song a big, more epic sound. It’s no wonder this has been going off in live settings so well. “We made this track as a new intro for our Ultra set two years ago!” GTA says of the track’s origins. “We wanted to bring back the ignorant club track mentality where random sounds seem to come out of nowhere, but add a fun aspect to the song . . . so we just said FK IT!”We only wish they had decided to release this sooner. Catch them playing it all over again in a city near you as they head out for a slew of international cities and major festival dates.

"Scottish export Watgood makes his New Noise debut with a fiery new release.Out now, “Porcelain” sees the up-and-comer seamlessly migrate through a variety of influences with a melody-driven introduction and an experimental trap-inspired drop that showcases his cutting-edge sound design, vocal cuts and jabbing drums. With support from tastemakers like Nest HQ, Zeds Dead, Boombox Cartel and more, it’s no question why the Steve Aoki-founded label is tapping into the budding producer’s talents.The Edinburgh-based artist’s upward trajectory continues following previous releases on Kitsuné, Mad Decent’s Good Enuff imprint, Buygore, TWONK and Dim Mak.

"Quality Goods Records delivers Ian Munro’s brand new Liminal EP, featuring five must-hear singles from the talented New Zealander.The EP opens with a hazy introductory track, “Palimpsest,” which clocks in at just over a minute and introduces Munro’s very own vocals and cinematic flair. Continuing the pattern on “Murmur,” Munro bellows, “I just want to feel.” His stirring synths paired with subtle fluttering melodies and organic drums make this track the perfect appetizer for the remainder of the project.He commissions Still Haze for vocals on “Rush,” which truly–as his bio explains–gives you something to feel. Deep tones, distorted sub-bass and drum fills cut through the placidity of the track, illustrating Munro’s production brilliance.Quality Goods Records fans revel at his collaboration with label boss UZ on “Without Me,” combining the two producer’s styles seamlessly, resulting in a trap-tinged melodic offering. Lastly, Munro leaves it all on the table with “Again, Again.” Unexpectedly bouncy 808s lay underneath anthemic female vocals and an incredibly smooth and heart-rending drop.“A huge part of this project was in the pursuit of catharsis: a blind stab in the dark for something more – something tangible,” says Monro. “You can fake it to try and play the game for a while, but that eats you up and spits you out hollowed. This EP is, in a way, my way of making sense of it all. Making sense of my place in the world — both musically and personally. I guess the concept of liminality really goes hand in hand with this. For a long time there, I was lost. I think this project really embodies those in-between moments that exist between discomfort and resolution – those moments of transformation and growth.” Listen to Liminal here:Connect with Ian Munro: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloudYou Might Also Like

First up, we asked Bleaching Agent to tell us a bit about the mix and what’s on the horizon…Recently I’ve been hopping around the UK and Europe occasionally playing gabber to rueful crowds, releasing a ton of records with Forward Strategy Group, and just finished putting together my next Gert P record, my pseudo-hardcore side project. That should be out later this year. And making a ton of discofied edits of old punk songs that I’ll never get round to playing out. Niall’s just rebuilding his studio at the moment and we’ve started making music as Body Horror.The mix was recorded a month ago at Niall’s place in the early hours of Sunday morning. With a bit planning and discussion beforehand we just jammed on Ableton, for which we’re very unapologetic. The idea was to record 90 minutes centred around Hi-NRG without using any real Hi-NRG music. It’s fairly representative of what we play from 4am onwards. Tough music for tough people.Up next…We only organise a handful of Body Horror parties a year so as to keep them as big occasions. We won’t put a show on unless we have a strong set of ideas for decor, theme, and guests, we set a very high bar for ourselves. We’re also in early talks to get a Body Horror record label up and running. COMMENTS",articles18,"['MIXTAPE', 'Niall’s']"
"With a scant seven days to go until Electric Forest kicks off (six if you’ve got early arrival), it’s time to map out your four (or five) magical days. Also, you should probably pack.We already gave you a handful of musical suggestions in our Top 5 “Big Font” Acts post, as well as a more general preview, so what makes this one different? Or necessary, for that matter?I’ll have you know that I have more to say, for starters, okay?! Geez, get off my back. I’m also very super overly excited to get back to the magical place I call home.There are so many options, side quests, and mini adventures to be discovered at Electric Forest. It’s truly a real life Choose Your Own Adventure story, though thankfully without the, “You died” mishaps. Hopefully. I figured it could be helpful to provide a list of suggestions from an EF veteran.In their own words, Electric Forest HQ says about the festival,Their aim is not only to build a community within the festival’s attendees, but also push those attendees to continue building past the festival’s conclusion.Want to see how a master does it? How a full song, complete with samples, is generated from one person’s mouth? Hit up one of the Honeycomb shows at the new-to-2019 space/stage, The….Honeycomb. According to him, the stage was not named after him, but after everybody sees him tear it up, that might change.His, or any of the other fantastic lineup of beat-boxers schedule throughout the festival may inspire you to want to take up a mic yourself to figure out how to artfully push air out of your mouth.At the Brainery, you can do just that courtesy of Forester Karl Olsson in his course: Beatbox for Beginners. It goes down Sunday from 2:00-3:00 PM.Let’s riff on a gender a bit, shall we? The concept of gender idtntity is about defining your journey, not determining your destination. It is about finding where on the spectrum that feels most right for you. It is also about respecting the place where others determine they feel most right.Just because it is private information does not mean it must be endured or explored in silence, or by yourself, for that matter. This project need not be individual, it is an exploration that can be worked out in tandem or even in greater numbers.It can be difficult at first to reconcile all of the shades of grey when you were born and raised in a society that’s beat into your head that gender is black and white.After putting in the work, you might just end up where you started. You might have all of the biological bits and pieces of a male and that is what feels most right for you. That is totally fine, but it is also only one journey of seven billion on Earth. It’s important to keep that in mind.One thing that throws a lot of people for a loops is that gender is not tied to sexual orientation or identity. Full stop. That can elicit a knee-jerk “DOES NOT COMPUTE” reaction from people new to this work, but it’s a crucial distinction to understand in order to progress.Your journey need not be solemn. It doesn’t have to occur in a funeral or study hall-like setting. It can look like a party or it can be a party. That was my big takeaway from meeting the Farce Family at Lightning in a Bottle. They looked like a clown troop, which they were, but I didn’t understand their purpose or their lessons until much later.The Farce Family will be in the Psychedelic Chapel throughout the weekend, and I’d imagine they’ll be wandering the woods in-between those times. They had a nautical theme at LiB, but I’m not sure if they’re going to keep that or come up with something new for the Forest. Only one way to find out. See you there?New this year is a kind of space-loaning program where HQ partitioned out a couple time slots each day in the Psychedelic Chapel to provide an opportunity for attendees to produce their own Forest attraction.It’s really too bad that they don’t provide more information each of these, because they’re a lot more involved than they appear at a glance. The only way I found out more about Forest Prom, for example, was due to me following one of the winners and she posted her crew’s plan for their Sunday evening hour: 🌳 ✨ 💒 EXCITING NEWS!!! Chapel parties for the people winners announced! . If you are going to Electric Forest this year you MUST stop by FOREST PROM!!

From Friday to Sunday, Sethward will unleash God knows what to an audience of young minds from 2:30-4:30 AM. I honestly have no idea what his project entails, but that isn’t going to stop me from checking it out, so it shouldn’t stop you, either.To the uninitiated, the Silent Disco can look pretty lame. I know it did to me, prior to strapping on a pair of color-changing headphones at EF 2015. I’ve described this in more detail before, but the act of placing those headphones over your ears closes you off to the world that you see and places you in what is usually a very private endeavor.But it’s not private. It is also not public. It’s just you and the people immediately around you. At first, it’s difficult to reconcile, but once you get used to it, Silent Discos are kind of the best.  Do what you can to make it to the Silent Disco in the Forest.However, if you happen to leave the confines of the Forest, all hope is not lost. If you’re out in GA camping, get your ass to the RV super camp sponsor Panky Rang’s Silent Disco, located near the Brainery on Main Street. You could always rent your own system and host a Silent Disco of your own. In fact, I hope you will!Speaking of the GA campground and Panky Rang, it’s time I let you in on a worst kept secret of Electric Forest: The after-parties.They used to be limited to official functions only, and once renegade parties in the campground got too big, they’d be shut down. But ever since the official Good Life sets were cut short with a hard curfew, the renegade parties have taken off.The first big one that I saw was on Sunday of EF 2016, when Dom and Jeremy of Big Gigantic played to a u-shaped courtyard created by very closely-parked RV’s. Jeremy played what looked like a toy drum set for kids and Dom was very restrained in his sax playing. In combination with the speakers pointing directly down at the crowd meant it was isolated from many of the nearby campers. There was still crowd noise, but it didn’t sound like more than a regular party.Flash forward to last year, where four specialized RV’s set up in a diamond pushed music out on all four sides from different DJ’s and producers. There were lineup posters and the rest of the RV’s had been moved out to provide plenty of room to dance. The renegade sets had blossomed into a legit festival within a festival.Now the event producers are at a point where they collaborate with HQ and operate in an official capacity to run the afterparties. What a long, strange trip. It’s certainly a long ways from the after-party we found in 2015 after walking past all of the RVs, through a field, and into another field to find music to dance to, quite literally, to the break of dawn.I covered the big names of the lineup already, but that’s not quite enough with four days’ worth of music, and that’s not even counting the tertiary lineups for the RV afterparty madness or the Grand Artique’s offerings inside the festival.In the interest of brevity, which you’re obviously not interested in if you made it this far, here’s a Spotify playlist featuring songs from all of our suggestions.This set is the obvious counterpart to our Top 5 Big Font, Claude Vonstroke. These fellow Dirtybird labelmates are like the high-performing children of Papa Claude and will likewise get down and dirty to some fantastic house. Friendly vibes abound, as is gratuitous booty-shaking. Beware of ass-quakes.Here’s the rub: For some strange reason, the organizers plucked Claude from his normal outpost at Tripolee and moved his set to Sherwood for the first time. Escapade will be at the opposite end of the festival on Claude’s old haunt. The two sets don’t overlap, which is appreciated, however it means once Claude is done, you’ll have to huck it through the grounds to catch Escapade. You’ll be going through Bassnectar’s set at Ranch Arena, so make sure to use the west exit of the Forest so you come out at the rear of Ranch. Here’s a map:The Where:Tripolee Saturday @  12:00 – 2:00 AM If you don’t know, Little Simz is Simbiatu “Simbi” Abisola Abiola Ajikawo, which is a mouthful and a great reason to opt for a more succinct name for her stage persona.To call Little Simz a rapper is a similarly reduced name that strips her story down to a basic function. Many rappers will take the stage with a producer armed with a laptop to provide their backing, and that works great for some, but not for Ajikawo. She performs with a full band and a dude with a laptop. She doesn’t leave the responsibilites to her band, either, she’ll take up the production controls or the bass in addition to delivering sharp lyrics at a blistering pace.If you want to see how much more can be done with hip-hop, make Little Simz’s appearance a priority.The Where:CarouselThursday @ 9:00 – 10:00 PMOver the years, Sacha Robotti has been running a kind of Tour de Record Labels which is impressive in itself, but when you consider the particular labels he’s released music through, it’s impressive to the power of ten. Defected, Suara, Dirtybird, Desert Hearts, the list goes on and on.It should come as no surprise that his music is mainly house. Of course I’d recommend going to see him, right? Probably, but that doesn’t make this any less earnest of a suggestion. He’s also the fifth Dirtybird labelmate on the lineup, so I’m not sure why they don’t have a curated stage this year. All the same, go see him.The Where:TripoleeSunday 5:00 – 6:00 PMAmtrac @ Electric Forest is a looooong time coming. For me, anyway. Ever since I found out about him six years ago, I thought his style would fit perfectly at the Forest. And now, all these years later, we will have the chance to see if I was right.At its heart, Amtrac’s music is undeniably House, but the pieces he uses to assemble songs are not the typical bright, glossy vocals or major keys typical of House. Instead, many samples are muted, the keys and progressions down instead of up. In that way, it winds up closer to Deep House, but it still retains all of the feels in House.The Where: Carousel ClubThursday 12:30 – 1:30 AMI could do a separate write-up for each of these guys, moreover I could write on and on about either one of them. And I have. But they’re similar in so many ways, often teaming up on b2b sets at Anjunadeep events or elsewhere, so I figured I’d smush them together.The Where:LuttrellTripoleeSunday 6:00 – 7:00 PMYottoTripoleeSunday 11:00 PM – 12:15 AMLee Fields was an unexpected name on the lineup. Unexpected, but very much welcome. As much as I love House and Deep House and Future House, I really value variety on a lineup. Lee Fields and the Expressions are pretty much the icing on the variety cake. Or the lineup cake. Or both?Think Charles Bradley in 2016 in Jubilee, but hopefully at a much lower volume. That show was criminally under attended and after his death in 2018, there was no way we could make it up to poor Charles. Let’s not do Lee Fields like that, okay?Lee Fields is a soul and R&B singer who’s been making music since 1969. He got his start mimicking the singing and dancing styles of James Brown, but he wound up developing his own style, which earned him collaborations with the likes of Kool and the Gang, BB King, Dr. John, Sharon Jones, and so many more absolute legends.More recently, he wrote a few songs and toured with Martin Solveig, of all people, so it should be a lot of fun to see, and there’s plenty of room for surprises.The Where:Carousel ClubThursday 10:30 – 11:30 PMHonest? Just listen to this song and tell me you don’t want to go jam out. This should be all you need. (And yes, I am aware that I am up to a count of 7, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to change the title of this section to top 7. No sirree.The Where: Ranch ArenaThursday 5:00 – 6:00 PMOnce you have an idea of what you want to accomplish, do your best not to procrastinate. “Later” becomes tomorrow, becomes Saturday, then Sunday, and before you know it, you’re on your way home.I work, live and play in Minneapolis.I try to tell the story of the people that create music and experiences through pictures as well as through words.",articles25,"['I’m', 'Polaroid', 'The Jive Joint', 'Sethward', 'Panky Rang', 'Panky Rang', 'Good Life', 'Bassnectar’s', 'Little Simz', 'Ajikawo', 'Little Simz’s', 'I’m', 'The Where', 'Amtrac’s', 'The Where:', 'Anjunadeep', 'The Where', 'Lee Fields', 'Charles Bradley', 'Lee Fields', 'BB King', 'Dr. John', 'Sharon Jones', 'Solveig', 'The Where:', 'The Where', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']"

A spiritual face-lift. A hot humanity injection delivered directly to the heart.What’s even better than a Gorgon City set? Two GC sets. Not only are they expert producers and songwriters, but they have a knack for mixing together filthy grime, lead heavy bass, hip-hop and tons of surprises into their DJ sets. I totally expected this to go down at the Grand Artique, but HQ went ahead and beat them to it by scheduling them at the Observatory. Be there or be square. Assuming square means not as entertained and in dangerous risk of FOMO.In a live setting, you’ll be treated to their incredibly talented pair of vocalists, Josh Barry and Chennai. They have incredible ranges and cover vocal duties for the wide gamut of Gorgon City collaborators when out on the road. Whether it’s filling in for Jennifer Hudson, MNEK, NAATIONS, or Kamille, they will surprise the hell out of you with their faithful vocals. It’s a thing of beauty.The Where:Live @ Sherwood Court 9:00 PM – 10:15 PMDJ Set @ The Observatory 12:45 AM – 1:45 AMThis will be one of your last chances to catch Odesza’s ‘A Moment Apart’ live production before they put it away forever. It’s funny, I think I’ve caught four of their ‘AMA’ shows and while it may be technically the same tour, each show has been slightly different. It also seems like the spectacle factor has kicked up each time. Never ones to half-ass anything, I’m sure they’ll go all out for their much beloved Forest Fam. Keep your eyes on the skies, as they’ve a long history of fireworks and the odd fleet of drones here and there.The funny thing about Odesza is that their music has been used in so many videos by and about Electric Forest that their sets can feel like a familiar soundtrack. It feels like home. It feels nostalgic for a time you are having at that moment, but also in parallel to the times you’ve seen them before. Man, Odesza got me all choked up just thinking about them.For the record, that “A Moment Apart” finale goes down July 27th in LA. Be there if you can.If there is a god, she is a woman. If she could see it in her heart to convince Harrison and Clayton to treat the fine folks of Electric Forest to a DJ set, or dare I say a NO SLEEP set, I would greatly appreciate it. I would GREATLY appreciate it.The Where:Ranch ArenaThursday 11:45 PM – 1:00 AMIf you like house music, if you like disco, if you like dancing, if you like being taken on a voyage, if you have a soul, then you will want to get your ass to Honey Dijon’s set in the sexy discoteque confines that is Carousel Club.Born in the same windy city as house music itself, Honey came up under the tutelage of house music architect/legend Derrick Carter. After a move to New York, she connected with another legend, Danny Tenaglia, who she also credits as a pivotal early and always influence.  A Honey Dijon set is like nothing else. On the surface, it’s somebody smushing records together, one after another, but the end result is so much bigger than that. It’s enlightenment. It’s gorgeous. It is….inevitable. You’ll get plenty of house and techno, you’ll get disco, and in-between you’ll witness some otherworldly feathering transitions and drops. Honey’s got skills for days.Honey Dijon’s inclusion in the 2019 lineup also represents HQ’s inclusivity initiatives and building a space where everybody feels safe as well as represented. As a staunch advocate for not only LGBTQA+ rights, but also for credit. The electronic music scene as we know it today would not exist were it not for the people of color who created the music and nobody would have heard it were it not for gay clubs. It’s important to know where these things came from and that history is often times swept under the rug.I can’t think of a more important show at Electric Forest, nor a more fitting setting than a Carousel Club styled after the famed Studio 54 in NYC. Be there.The Where: Carousel Club June 30, 2019 1:30 AM – 3:15 AM I know Electric Forest isn’t that old, but I still want to say that STS9 is classic Forest music. Or maybe definitive? Ooh! A pillar in the musical structure! Sound Tribe sits squarely at this apex between electronic music and acoustic. Or maybe it’s the center of a Venn diagram of jam bands, electronic music, digital and acoustic.However I describe them won’t do their live performance justice. Aside from Cheese, you probably won’t find a happier group of fans than at STS9, particularly so at the Forest. After a few years away, the band will likely be as excited as their audience for their return.Did I say Top 5? Yeah? Well, I guess I’m a liar. If it’s Bob Moses that makes me a liar, I can totally accept that.You can think of Bob Moses as a kind of spiritual/musical cousin to Rufus Du Sol. They share a soft, heartfelt vulnerability in their songwriting, they both ride a border between a standard traditional band and an electronic act, and their DJ sets are the stuff of legend. So much so that BBC invited them to join the fabled Essential Mix club back in 2016.The surprises aren’t just reserved for their DJ mixes, though. This past April, they unleashed a cover of The Prodigy’s “Fire” to a crowd that wasn’t quite sure what to make of it. The selection wasn’t entirely out of left field, though, as it served as a tribute to the great Keith Flint, vocalist of The Prodigy who passed away a month earlier.Not only do they have great taste, but they also have class. Catch both of their sets on Friday:Live @ Sherwood Court 11:00 PM – 12:15 AMDJ Set @ The Observatory 2:00 AM – 3:15 AMWell, that’s it, folks! Keep an eye on ElectroJams.com or any of our socials for more previews of Electric Forest.

KonSoul have been brought to our attention for very good reason. They are a breath of fresh air in the D&B scene.KonSoul is a new group comprised of drummer/producer Tom Derryman, bass player/musician David Spicer and singer/songwriter Sarah Binney. They combine their eclectic experience to deliver the rarely heard sound in DnB of live musicians jamming.They collectively began a studio writing project at Spicer’s Devon-based Osmosis studios. It was here they began recording their own drum breaks. They went on to lay down dubby basslines and combined this with Sarah’s unique vocal talents. Resulting in beautiful music!Drawing from their funk, soul and dub influences, these recordings of live takes fused together. Using modern DnB production techniques this has grown into the sound we hear on this first single.KonSoul bring a pleasingly alternative angle to the Symmetry Recordings catalogue with their debut single ‘Circular’/ ‘The Automatic’.

Dropping their new single ‘Solace’, the final cut from a triple-hitter EP out now on Monstercat.‘Solace’ joins the 2015 single ‘We Won’t Be Alone’ and the 2016 release ‘Words’, as well as an acoustic recording of ‘Solace’. Masterfull and delicate in its production, the track’s rolling pace and effortless percussion should hit all the right notes with drum & bass fans. Brehm’s drifting, dreamy vocal is perfectly balanced by Feint’s expert use of deep synths, undulating orchestration and smatterings of guitar and string sections that pepper the composition.Brehm’s vocal is unquestionably the flicker in the darkness of Feint’s production. For the Colorado native, ‘Solace’ not only continues her relationship with Feint and Aiden but also the iconic Monstercat family. Speaking about the single and her long-standing affiliation with the label, Brehm said:With ‘We Won’t Be Alone’ and ‘Words’ racking up a combined total of almost 70 million streams across Spotify and YouTube, ‘Solace’ makes for a fitting finale to the trio’s latest creative chapter.Feint and Laura Brehm ‘Solace’ EP is out now.

"Glasgow Underground owner and house producer, Kevin McKay has finally announced his a 10-track concept album.  The album, which he gave the exclusive news, during our recent BMC interview, is an album of rebooted and revitalised classics.Due for release in September 2019, ‘No Samples Were Harmed In The Making Of This Record’ brings old favourites back to life and in the process, explores an underused method of production that could inspire artists on a global scale.The album’s first single dropped in May (which we premiered, above) – a vocal-driven cover of Randy Crawford’s 1977 track ‘Hallelujah’ on which Kevin joined forces with David Penn, to produce this Ibiza-worthy piano house record.The new developments in audio recognition technology, sampling and legalities are at their most temperamental state; there is no guaranteed safe zone for producers and with so many labels re-issuing funk, soul and disco catalogues, copywriting restrictions are at an all-time high.Kevin took this situation as the main inspiration for the album’s concept and worked out how he could twist it to his advantage as an artist:“I’m a DJ at heart. I’m not a multi-instrumentalist composer or songwriter. I like having new exciting tracks in my sets and making them yourself makes playing them out all the most exciting. So sampling is a key element of “my” music. To sample things legally you have to ask the original songwriters if it’s ok and it can take 6-12 months to clear an idea. By the time it comes back I’m usually so over the original idea it’s a waste of time for me to record it.   The one thing you can do quickly and easily is a cover version. These have traditionally been frowned upon as never-as-good-as-the-original. However, the internet has made it much easier to find and record great singers and musicians who can perform just as well as the original recording artist (and sometimes better in my opinion!). So, my mission with this album was to do what I always have, be inspired by music from the past and make club tracks for today. You might recognise some of the songs on this album, but none of them are the original performers. And the record is 100% legal. And hopefully 100% exciting when you are on the dancefloor.”TracklistKevin McKay – Fever Called LoveKevin McKay – Save MeKevin McKay & Joshwa – Such a Good FeelingKevin McKay & David Penn – Hallelujah Kevin McKay – Move Your Body (Elevation)Kevin McKay – I Got The Feeling Kevin McKay ft Start The Party – Million Dollar BillKevin McKay ft Start The Party – I Feel LoveKevin McKay & Matt Fontaine – Get Get DownKevin McKay ft Start The Party – Don’t Leave Me This Way ",articles34,"['Randy Crawford’s', 'David Penn', 'Ibiza']"

"In Point Blank’s most recent masterclass, they were joined by UK drum and bass boss Kove to find out how he made his haunting dnb track, ‘Echoes’.
Kove has well and truly secured his reputation in the drum and bass scene, with his tracks gaining attention from the legendary duo Chase & Status who signed him to their label, MTA Records. He’s toured the US with big hitters Netsky and 12 Planet and is constantly in high demand for the European festival season, having played at the likes of Hideout, EXIT, Creamfields, Reading and Leeds and more. His Spotify streams exceed the millions and that’s no surprise due to his emotive, kinetic tracks which keep the genre sounding fresh as ever. With years of experience under his belt, beginning music production roughly 10 years ago, Kove has plenty of tricks up his sleeve which he’s kindly shared. If you’re interested in learning more about the techniques demonstrated in the video below, Point Blank offer courses in Music Production, DJing and more at global locations including London, Los Angeles, China, Ibiza, Mumbai and Online.
During the track breakdown, Kove, real name James Rockhill, shows exactly how he created the track’s organic-sounding guitar distortion using Logic’s inbuilt pedalboard. He follows this up by demonstrating his go-to techniques for manipulating, stretching and warping audio, which is perfect for an audio-heavy track like ‘Echoes’. Trying to get your bass and vox to sit comfortably in the mix can sometimes be difficult – but don’t worry, Kove is a master at this and shows exactly how he creates his deep, wide sounding basses and polished vocals using his plugins of choice. The UK-producer and DJ also drops some serious knowledge on how imperfections and mistakes can add beautiful character to your tracks.

Luxembourg-based musician and producer Samuel Reinard better known as Ryvage just shared a video of his new single ‘Another Day Another Time’.
The 5-track EP titled ‘Tides’ is composed of melodic electro-pop, dark synth-driven electronica and ambient soundscapes. Industrial-tinged sounds and percussions are meeting 80’s beats and synthwave elements while waves of powerful synth leads and atmospheric pads are battling with arpeggios and heavily processed vocals.
“It’s a personal and intuitive record. I didn’t use any conceptual filter or criteria like I used to do in other projects. It was all about finding a musical & sonic formula to explore topics like memory, mood swings, anxiety and escapism, using my computer and machines”, Ryvage commented.
‘Another Day Another Time’ is a rework of a track taken from the 2017 album ‘It Will Be Forever’ by electronic producer Sun Glitters. “When he asked me if I would be interested in reworking one of his tracks, I chose this one for its mood and melodies.

Celebrating the release of his 14 track LP
The French-born and Berlin-based artist has recently released the melodic journey ‘Nothing Can Compare’ on the well known All Day I Dream imprint. The album, which is inspired by recent events, showcases his deep style while taking its listeners on a musical trip packed with personal emotions.
“This collection of tracks is the translation of a deep inner explorative journey,” said YokoO. “It somewhat expresses [in a musical way] many of the feelings and emotions I experienced over the last few years, after meeting a woman who changed the course of my life forever.”
To commemorate this milestone, YokoO has embarked on a multi-city tour where he brings parts of the album into each celebration. In his Miami appearance at the well-known Do Not Sit On The Furniture, he will be backed by rising start Nii Tei who’s been having a busy schedule on his own with recent national and international gigs.

"Guess who’s back…back again…Just when the public opinion about Ultra Miami 2020 was turning into concern, Miami came crawling back. The latest agenda for the Miami City Commission Meeting (scheduled for June 27) includes a contract for Ultra Music Festival to return to Bayfront Park. The agenda just dropped Tuesday evening.The Resolution allows the City Manager of Miami to present a formal offer to Ultra for the return to Bayfront Park via a revocable license (like what they had at Virginia Key). There is not yet a deal reached, but Miami is going to propose one. Miami felt the burn after Ultra announced its intentions to leave the City. Miami initially pushed Ultra out of its Bayfront Park home and aimed to place it at Virginia Key. The move proved exceedingly difficult and did little to settle down neighboring communities. When Ultra shared its infamous “break up letter”, other municipalities hyped up the idea of Ultra moving to new places. Then Miami felt pangs of regret and formulated a plan to prevent Ultra’s exodus. Here it is. The resolution is more of an opening salvo, slim on details but heavy on importance. The resolution highlights Ultra’s history there and the huge financial impact the festival has had on the City. It also proposes essentially that the previous revocable license for Virginia Key be swapped for one at Bayfront Park. Ultra reverts back to midnight closing time on Friday/Sat and 11PM on Sunday. The fee remains at $2million as it was last year, but a big change is how long the park will be closed. The entire property can only be closed to the public for 14 days. The entire build-up/festival/tear-down can only take 30 days TOTAL. This is because the local citizens want the park available for their use more often and complained about Ultra’s impact on that previously. The capacity is 55,000 per day but can be increased subject to reasonable discretion.This deal is also indefinite like the previous deal for Virginia Key, with 1-year renewals. Generally, the rest of the finer points are carryovers from the Virginia Key deal. This deal has to be voted on at the June 27th City Commission Meeting, so you can be sure we’ll all be watching! It’s still not a done deal by any means, and Homestead is waiting in the wings as well. You can read the full resolution and license deal below. ",articles11,"['Tuesday', 'TOTAL', '! It’s']"

"Libra, a new cryptocurrency Facebook has been quietly working on for over a year, was just released to the world on Tuesday. The new coin will be launching next year. With over 27 massive partners and a similar structure to Bitcoin, this might be the next global currency to invest in. From the crypto-news site , a leaked list shows some notable partners for the new currency. Some big names include Visa, Mastercard, Lyft, PayPal, Uber, and Spotify. Each of these powerhouse companies will be investing $10 million in the new digital coin. From the Libra homepage: In a blog post shared earlier today, Spotify explains their involvement with the new cryptocurrency. Alex Norström, Spotify’s Chief Premium Business Officer, said:“One challenge for Spotify and its users around the world has been the lack of easily accessible payment systems – especially for those in financially underserved markets. This creates an enormous barrier to the bonds we work to foster between creators and their fans. In joining the Libra Association, there is an opportunity to better reach Spotify’s total addressable market, eliminate friction and enable payments in mass scale.”In light of over 2.5 billion customers on Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, Facebook will be offering Libra to the majority of its users. The platform is also planning to utilize its partnerships with Uber and Spotify. This could involve using Libra as a payment method for rides and online subscription services. Libra may also be serving as a possible substitute for PayPal and Venmo in the near future. Last year we saw the Elements Music Festival accept payments for tickets via Bitcoin, and they’re not the only ones. Could there be a future for Libra in the music world?

"Ever wonder when it might be time to hang up the towel and retire from raving? TickPick, a ticketing platform from New York, found that the majority of people believe you never have to retire from the rave scene. TickPick did the hard work for us and surveyed 1,000 people of varying ages. Questions ranged from “What’s the prime age for every concert and night out”, to “When do people feel you’re simply too old to party?” 45% or nearly half of the surveyed users believed one was never too old to attend raves. Contrary, 65% thought you’re never too old to party. As far as the largest agreement, 89% believed one is never too old to attend small shows at local venues. Jazz music for example, has a wide audience, attracting party people as they got older. The study did include key factors like aging and societal norms. As we get older, it may get more difficult to move, along with one’s ability to recover from late nights out and drinking. Furthermore, depending on where you’re from, your society may judge you if you’re that ‘one guy’ in your 40s-50s, still partying in clubs or bar hopping. Still, the choice is yours and you can stay in that scene as long as you wish!Even though attending raves and parties with friends feels like the best time of your life, many older adults feel they prefer their current lives, once moved on. Around 86% of respondents preferred their current day to day life over their old partying days. It makes sense as dropping the party scene, usually leads to less drinking, which in turn, leads to greater mental and physical health. Nonetheless, we hope everyone enjoys their raving days today, even if that last night out does arrive.",articles11,[None]

"Genius Media Group Inc is an online song lyric provider that has had enough of living in Google‘s shadows. For many years, Genius claims that they have lost a substantial amount of foot traffic due to Google. Google has allegedly been stealing lyrics from genius.com and displaying them through its own platform, thus eliminating Genius’ click-throughs. To prove that Google has been ripping content from their hard-earned work, Genius set up secret morse codes embedded into song lyrics. Genius has been around since 2009 as “a platform for annotating clever rap lyrics.” In 2016, Genius took notice of the striking similarities of Google’s lyrics compared to theirs. Genius devised a plan to include morse codes within alternating apostrophes of their song lyrics to spell out “red-handed.” According to WSJ, Genius said it found more than 100 examples of songs on Google that came from Genius’ site.  “Over the last two years, we’ve shown Google irrefutable evidence again and again that they are displaying lyrics copied from Genius,” said Ben Gross, Genius’s chief strategy officer, in an email message.  Google denies all claims of stealing from Genius, of course. Google apparently forged a partnership with LyricFind, whom they state, secures deals with music publishers that allow Google to publish lyrics online. According to Google, they aim for better user experience by providing information boxes directly on their site versus redirecting them to sites like Genius.  “We take data quality and creator rights very seriously, and hold our licensing partners accountable to the terms of our agreement. We’re investigating this issue with our data partners and if we find that partners are not upholding good practices we’ll end our agreements.” This isn’t the first time that Google has disrupted other companies’ business models. For example, Google Maps directly competes with sites like Yelp to provide services directly on Google. In conclusion, there’s no clear answer as to how Genius will resolve this issue yet. Since Genius doesn’t actually own copyright per the song lyrics, legal experts state that any sort of legal battle will be long and cumbersome.",articles11,[]

"Reigning down from Barbados, this British artist has been taking control of the airwaves since 1980. Carl Cox, A.K.A. “Coxy”, to call him a DJ would be an understatement, as he is a cognoscente of electronic music; no one can top this legend. Carl “coxy” Cox, was born in Barbados in July 29 1962, has taken life by the horns and made it his servant. But the great Coxy, didn’t wake up with a silver spoon in his mouth. Carl Cox, was a laborer growing up and took on numerous jobs that had nothing to do with creating music. Just at the at of 15 Carl Cox was working as mobile DJ and he played what most of London’s youth was playing, rare groove, New York Hip-Hop, and electro. It wasn’t until 1987’s , Acid Trax’ by Phuture (a.k.a. DJ Pierre), that he had his “a-ha!” moment.  “’ “In his interview latest with Forbes Magazine he mentions that he is resilient and wasn’t going to let financial obstacles get in the way. “My last job before I was a DJ was a scaffolder, and before that, I was a painter and decorator, and before that I was I was a builder’s mate, a plasterer’s mate and a chippy.” Additionaly, Coxy has character; he is a well rounded individual who has not only worked many non-musical jobs, but was also a club goer himself long before he began his musical career. ” I know what it’s like to be on the other side of the coin. I know what it’s like to wait in a queue, to save up my money to go to an event, when I couldn’t wait to hear the DJ play. I was right in the middle of the dance floor listening to the sound system with a big smile on my face, and dancing my ass off! Most DJs don’t have that experience, most go straight into the DJ booth. But I was a clubber for a least 10 to 15 years before I was DJing. The only reason that I DJed was that – all the time I was dancing – the DJ wasn’t really giving me what I wanted. So I thought, the only way I can do that is to do it myself. So that’s what I did, I became a DJ.” Carl Cox held one of the longest if not the longest residencies at Club Space in Ibiza, Spain where he was a resident DJ for 16 years. The most beloved club in Ibiza was then bought out by, Ushuaïa Entertainment in 2016 and renamed as Hï Ibiza. Club Space Ibiza was not his only curating addition, he is a huge reason Ultra Music Festival in Miami is the festival we know today.  What began with his own tent that held 2,500 festival goers “Carl Cox & Friends.”To the “Carl Cox Megastructure” that holds 20,000 festival goers. In 2008, Carl Cox began playing at Burning Man.In 2018 he curated the “Purple Party” paying homage to the late singer Prince.Known to be one of the most humble artist in the scene, Carl Cox reminds us that he will not think of himself as a cynical person; his success doesn’t make him better than anyone. His humble and kind perspective is welcomed and we applaud him.  “I’m so happy, I feel blessed and honored to be doing what I’m doing. I feel privileged to be able to be in this position, and to give you what you believe you should be getting from me as a DJ, but also as a person, because at the end of the day I’ll have a beer with anyone, I’ll have a shot with everyone. I don’t see myself any higher than anyone else.” In conclusion, Carl Cox is a THE man. He is the artist we didn’t know we needed. His contribution to the music and his enthusiasm for the new generation to come is unrivaled. Thank you Carl Cox for all you’ve done and thank you for giving us the swankiest techno tunes we didn’t know we deserve.",articles11,"['Barbados', 'Barbados', 'London’s', 'DJ Pierre', '!

"Seven Lions is one of the rare performers in dance music that somehow straddles the line between trance and dubstep. How he does it? We’re not entirely sure. He might have been one of the first DJs to introduce psytrance into the bass music scene, where it has found a nice home being randomly dropped in the middle of sets all over the place. However for Seven Lions, psytrance isn’t just a gimmick. In fact, he is now revealing a brand new psytrance project called Abraxis. This is a collaborative alias with Dimibo and it will be getting its live debut at Dreamstate SoCal in November. The teasing began today when Seven Lions posted a cryptic message about some sort of meditation institute. It turns out that when you go to the site you take a quiz that is basically like an X-Men personality test. At the end you are treated to an Abraxis track preview in 8-bit form. You can tell right away this is some heavy psytrance. Only a short bit later, Dreamstate let the cat out of the bag completely. It revealed that Abraxis is Seven Lions and Dimibo and they will be debuting at the festival in the fall. ",articles11,"['Abraxis', 'Dimibo', 'X-Men', 'Abraxis', 'Only', 'Dreamstate']"
"Not too long ago, Yotto and Lane 8 announced via Facebook that something new is on the horizon. Judging by the photo, we can anticipate it’ll be new music based from these two legendary artists. Thursday is the day we’ve been waiting for, so mark your calendars and get your computers ready for download. If this is the ending track to Lane 8’s Summer 2019 Mixtape, we’re surely excited. This collaboration is golden and we couldn’t think of two better producers to do so. From the teaser in the mix, it’s a gentle and calming track. The signature sounds of Daniel and Otto intertwine to give us a dynamic flow. The melody is simply soothing and backed by gorgeous synths. Progressively flowing through house vibes, I/Y looks likes it’s going to be one heck of a summer banger.The release will be on Goldstein’s This Never Happened label. With the mix receiving great feedback and interaction already, this new music announcement is even more enticing. Everything they touch turns to melodic gold. On June 29th, come join Lane 8 among friends for a daytime of great music at the Grand Park in Los Angeles. The magic of these Summer Gatherings is the sense of community and connection Goldstein aims to bring. He is truly inspirational and admirable for promoting a phone-less, photo-less space. That is the beauty that comes with his TNH label. Watch him play both a 2-hour opening set and a 3-hour closing set. In between, enjoy special guests from the extended TNH family. Perhaps we’ll get to hear their latest new piece as well. If you would like to hear a preview, however, the mixtape is available for listening below. Enjoy the many artists he highlights and showcases, and get ready for summer!",articles11,"['Facebook', 'Thursday', 'Daniel']"
"Black Rock Desert is a seemingly endless expanse for the annual Burning Man Project. However, the United States Bureau of Land Management is recommending an event attendance cap for the next 10 years. The festival takes place 100 miles north of Reno and currently has an 80,000 person capacity. Organizers have proposed raising this to as high as 100,000 attendees in coming years. After releasing the final environmental impact statement on June 14, the BLM says it prefers to stick with the cap that’s been in place since 2017. Alternatives proposed in the final environmental impact statement included capping the total population for the event to 50,000 or, worst-case scenario, not issuing a permit to Burning Man. That’s right—there’s a tiny chance that Burning Man could be cancelled.The agency has said that it will work with Burning Man organizers to address environmental and security concerns. However, the BLM will not advocate any of the changes proposed at this time. The bureau is also considering hiring a private security firm this year to conduct drug screenings, but might wait until 2020. News of this idea has caused a bit of an uproar with event attendees, who’ve been deeming the drug searches unconstitutional in public meetings. Rudy Evenson, a BLM spokesman, told the Reno Gazette Journal:“ The BLM and cooperating agencies could not support the event growing. The city of Reno, Nevada Department of Transportation, Nevada Highway Patrol as well as the Bureau of Land Management could not support the growth particularly because there are other events going on during Labor Day.”One third of the federal agency’s law enforcement is needed to patrol the current size of the event. If the event grew to 100,000, this would grow to . one half required. Another concern, voiced by spokesman Evenson, is finding ways to
alleviate traffic congestion on surrounding roads. Alternative solutions from
transportation agencies would need to be created before any growth.On the bright side, the agency said it could permit growth of the event in the future if BLM officials and festival organizers find solutions to the problems discussed. Despite the positive sentiment, this isn’t the first time the Burning Man Project and the BLM have butted heads on these issues. In light of the environmental impact statement, Burning Man representatives said they intend to thoroughly analyze the document by the BLM. Above all, the organization intends to focus on 2019’s event held August 25 – September 2. “Our priority at the moment is the 2019 event, and we are
deeply engaged in planning and production,” Burning Man organizers said.",articles11,"['Rock Desert', 'Organizers', 'Alternatives', 'Burning Man', 'Burning Man', 'Burning Man', 'Nevada Highway Patrol', 'Burning Man', 'Burning Man']"
"The historically outspoken Deadmau5 has been quiet lately on social media regarding anything other than his upcoming tour and KAOS nightclub residency. However, Joel Zimmerman recently filled fans in on what he has been up to during his break and his struggles with a “creative drought.”Deadmau5 took to Reddit Wednesday, June 12 to share an update with fans regarding his new Cube V3 Tour, new releases and the trouble he’s been having with his creative process. In his post, Joel says he has a handful of releases on the way but doesn’t give any definitive dates of when fans will get to hear the tracks. Deadmau5 then mentions he’s been experiencing a creative drought. Some of the contributions that he says have led to the drought include his personal life, the break from his socials and the pressure to finish the Cube show. “…lots of little things have just contributed to that weird debilitating feeling…” Deadmau5 said. He says that the feeling can often turn into musical frustration,
which can be bad news for artists and fans alike. Joel goes on to say he signed up for in-home piano lessons, stating they might be a good little break. He jokes that he might develop techniques to be a “real fucking musician.”While Deadmau5 is still full steam ahead on the Cube V3 Tour, he hints at some new ideas besides music to take the place of his absence of online streaming.

"After careful consideration, Paradigm chairman and CEO Sam Gores, respectfully declined to sell his agency to UTA. UTA had recently offered around $250 million to buy Paradigm but in the end, both agencies would stay solo. At the moment, both companies are better off focusing on their specialties to best represent their clients. Then again, if the two powerhouse corporations did merge, they would have taken even more control over the music and film/tv industry. “Let’s all get back to work and continue to do what we do so well. For the Art For the Artist.”UTA, which focuses more on the film & television side of entertainment, represents many of your favorite celebrities including Kevin Hart and Chris Pratt. On the other hand, Paradigm manages some of the top musicians including Coldplay, Ed Sheehan, and Major Lazer. Sam Gores of Paradigm, explained that a merger of the agencies may have worked but Paradigm’s unique qualities leaves them more powerful on their own. In many ways, merging two incredibly large corporations into one, would make communication among clients and employees more difficult. Gores experienced this firsthand while considering the deal with UTA. Overall, he listed this as one of the big negatives of merging together, stating “I always make decisions regarding the future of the business by considering what is ultimately in the best interest of our agency as a whole and all of our clients.” Gores continues to stand up for his clients and employees, even with a huge amount of money on the table. UTA CEO Jeremy Zimmer, respects Gores’ decision stating, “We admire Sam and the business he and his colleagues have built”. While disappointed a deal wasn’t made, Zimmer wished Paradigm good fortune going forward. Nevertheless, even while this deal failed to merge the two agencies, it doesn’t mean they’re done for good.

"Troubling news casts a shadow over the closing hours of Bonnaroo as reports of a campsite death are developing. It’s been a long weekend for the festival that continues to make headlines for all the wrong reasons. The mood inside the festival is surely somber as multiple news outlets await comment from local authorities.However, a local publication, , is reporting preliminary comments from Ann Ewing. The director of crisis communication for Kaleidoscope Media had this to say about the incident: “A 27-year-old male patron camping with his father was unresponsive,” Ewing continued in the statement. “The medical team administered CPR, and he was transported to the hospital. We understand that he had an underlying medical condition, and that, unfortunately, he has died.”Although it is too soon to speculate, this development is eerily similar to an incident that rocked the festival last year. In 2018 a campsite death was the result of Michael Donivan Craddock Jr. overdosing on a cocktail of drugs which included MDMA. Furthermore, the Coffee County Sherriff’s Department busted a man allegedly trafficking and manufacturing ecstasy on Thursday. Check out their Facebook post here:Hopefully, for Bonnaroo, these two stories are unrelated. After a weekend like they’ve had, the last thing they need is a storyline to further tarnish their reputation. As of this writing, no further comments are coming from the event organizers. Certainly, they’re monitoring the situation closely.Above all, our hearts go out to the loved ones of the deceased during this difficult time. Seemingly, first responders delivered aid in a timely manner but were unable to prevent this campsite death. Although, quite a bit about this story still remains unclear.

"Half of 2019 has come & gone, and we’re not even mad. This year has seen tons of new music released by our favorite artists’, with some of them even releasing full-fledged albums. After reviewing these releases, we can easily say that this has been a good year for not just EDM but music in general. Every year, the staff here at EDMTunes gets together to give you our top picks for the best albums of the year. We do this both at the halfway mark of the year, as well as the end of the year. Below is are our favorite picks for the best albums of 2019 thus far. Did your favorites make the list? See for yourself below! What was perhaps the one of the most looked forward to albums in a very long time was Avicii‘s posthumous album ‘TimReleased a little over a year since his passing, this album perfectly displays the musical trajectory of Avicii, while simultaneously giving us some insight into his state of mind. Although this album is to remember Avicii, Tim is a perfect album that makes Avicii’s spirit present. Sitting at 12 tracks, listening to this album is a good way to spend a Friday afternoon.One of two Trance entries to make our list, Andrew Bayer‘s ‘In My Next Life is quite the spectacle.  Released on Anjunabeats, the album takes the tracks from his experimental ‘In My Last Life‘, and turns them into club-ready bangers. This album takes listeners to another world with emotional synths for instant chills. If you’re a fan of Andrew Bayer, or just Trance, you’re gonna want to check this one out.No strangers to the spotlight, UK-based producers Third Party wowed us with their sophomore album titled ‘Together The album features 9 tracks, and they are all gold. Through this album, Third Party brings their unique take on progressive to life once more. This is best displayed in their track ‘which this album is named after. Check it out.After more than a six-year wait, 2019 saw Feed Me release his ‘High Street Creeps album on Mau5trap. Featuring 10 tracks in total, ‘tastefully combines Electro-house and Pop elements that we can’t help but vibe to. With various of different sounds incorporated throughout this album, ‘High Street Creeps’ is one for the books. Throughout the album, Feed Me shows off his skillful talent by blending various rhythmic chord patterns as well as soft settle sounds for an enjoyable listen. With his major hit off the album, ‘Feel Love‘, Feed Me has proven that he is capable of fusing multiple sounds together. If you’re a fan of Feed Me, you don’t want to miss this one.What is easily the most star-studded album on this list, Labrinth, Sia, & Diplo came together last year to present us their joint project ‘LSD You might recognize the track ‘ as its easily the biggest tune within the 10 song tracklist. It even makes its way onto the album a second time as the album features an exclusive Lil Wayne remix.After breaking through in 2007 with his Beatport topping ‘Air Conditionné‘, 2019 is the year that we finally get an album from Julian Jeweil. Out on on Adam Beyer‘s Drumcode Records, ‘Transmission‘ features 11 tracks of pure, unadultured techno. The title track of this album ‘is easily one of our favorites, be sure to give it a listen. This album got rinsed by Adam Beyer x Cirez D, bringing huge attention to many of its tracks.The second Trance album to make our list is ‘by KEY 4050. Comprised of Irish DJ & Record Producers John O’Callaghan and Bryan Kearney, this album is the cream of the crop as far as trance is concerned. The album is a double disc feature, and each disc contains 16 tracks, for a whopping 32 track setlist. If you’re into Trance, or either of these artists, be sure clear your weekend & give this a listen.While technically not an album, Kaskade‘s Redux 003 deserves a spot on this list for the sheer number of tunes alone. Coming in at a whopping 18 tracks, Redux 003 is a nice departure from the main stage EDM sound. Kaskade has created more to Redux 003 than it just being an album. With many Redux shows already under his belt, he plans to bring Redux to bigger venues for a full blown intimate experience. Although Redux 003 is no the typical main stage act Kaskade fans would expect, this album truly brings another genre of dance music to the table that is pretty incredible. All in all, the compilation features a more house oriented vibe, similar to the sound that helped Kaskade originally break through.Well, these are our picks for the top albums of 2019 so far. With the latter half of the year well on its way, it will be interesting to see what albums make our end of the year list. With artists’ like DJ Snake, Illenium, & Calvin Harris, and Gaia (Armin van Buuren) slated to drop albums this year, we can definitely count on some good music in the coming months. Hang tight, we’re in for a good one.",articles11,"['Every', '! What', 'Avicii‘s', 'Third Party', 'Third Party', 'Lil Wayne', 'DJ Snake', 'Illenium']"
"In any artists’ dedicated fan group, you’ll come across a discussion about their best performances. We decided we would do the same thing here at EDMTunes and give you the Best Sets for a range of DJs and producers. This series will highlight each artists’ best and most memorable live performances. The ones that really make their career and the ones any fan should know about. With an established moniker spanning a decade, deadmau5 had many moments of significance throughout his career. Joel Zimmerman‘s music and live shows shaped and inspired much of electronic music’s climate today. With that in mind, let’s go down the mouse burrow with his best sets and moments.Deadmau5 took the stage in his home town of Toronto to perform with the refined version of his Cube. In addition to playing some of his most revered tracks, SOFI showed up. As a result, we got to hear a full performance of ‘SOFI Needs A Ladder‘ followed by ‘One Trick Pony‘.In co-operation between Nokia, Joel had a London tower litten up with visuals. A highlight recording surfaced on YouTube showcasing ‘FML‘, ‘Professional Griefers‘, ‘Moar Ghosts N Stuff‘ and ‘Bad Selection‘.Soon after debuting The Cube v3 at Ultra, the Mau5trap owner took to EDC Las Vegas without his creation. His time on stage started with a Testpilot leaning sound which transferred to some fan favorites. The artist proves yet again that he can keep fans tuned in for his work.Around the peak when Martin Garrix‘s ‘Animals‘ went viral, deadmau5 played it as an ‘Old Macdonald‘ flip. This happened to the surprise of many at Ultra, with many expecting the original or confused that he played it. The clip reigns atop numerous trolls by Joel and will always be a fun remnant.Colliding two worlds, Zimmerman performed a two hour mix for BBC Radio One’s Essential mix series. Listening to the first hour, Testpilot original sound punches through which contrasts the Deadmau5 mix taking over the second. Don’t forget that you can hear ‘A Seed’, ‘Midas Heel’, ‘Saturn’ and ‘Coasted’ in all their glory. This concluded in a satisfying two hours of music curated for fans of both monikers.The Cube grew and evolved as the years passed by, with the first toured model shown in the starting video. deadmau5 then revived it and toured the 2.1 version. For Ultra 2019, the artist announced that he wanted to perform with the third version. Luckily, we got a live stream of the performance (which did not go without a hitch). You can watch the most recent Cube in action in the video below!Glastonbury 2015, Deadmau5 showed off his Cage stage design on stream. While the stage did not receive much action, we at least have a recording to look towards.Joel took to Reddit to update us on The Cube and his creative state. Furthermore, he’s looking to debut the third version of the Cube at UK’s Creamfields festival. He kicks off a North American tour on September 12 which you can buy tickets for here.",articles11,"['The Cube', 'Martin Garrix‘s', 'Colliding', 'Zimmerman', 'The Cube', 'Luckily', 'Cage', 'Reddit', 'The Cube']"
"Alesso is back and this time with a summer tune that will get you in your feels. After announcing that he was starting his acting career on Netflix show, Little Black Mirror, he finally broke silence and released a brand new tune.Featuring vocals from TINI, this song is a story about two lovers. TINI is longing for her partner’s presence and makes it very clear in the lyrics. However, she realizes that it’s not for the best and she’s only being used. Either way, she can’t seem to stay away and still loves her partner.Switching over to the music side of this song, it features a very chill and poppy melody that gives off some tropical house vibes, perfect for your summer activities. The drop transitions into a slow lead melody accompanied by the chorus vocals.This track embodies the artist side of Alesso very well. If you blink for a second, you might miss that there’s hardly a buildup and it’s mostly just groovy music. This shows the growth of Alesso from once only being an EDM producer to being a musical artist. You can listen to it down below or here.",articles11,"['TINI', 'Either']"
"As we creep up on the midway point of 2019 there are already so many huge headlines to look back on. With countless dope album releases, controversies, and beefs, it’s hard to predict how the industry will change. With this in mind, you have to wonder- what’s impacting the future of Dance Music the most? These are the seven most important factors.Although EDM is the most popular it’s ever been, the artists aren’t exactly reaping the benefits of the industry boom. In a post-Napster-and-LimeWire world where piracy and peer-to-peer sharing dominates consumption, artists must evolve. Several new revenue streams are being exploited with the latest innovation being curated festivals. Porter Robinson, Riot Ten, DJ Diesel, and Odesza are some of the artists now hosting their own events. With the instant success of the Second Sky Festival, more DJs are sure to follow suit. Porter laid out the blueprint and proved that it could actually work. Expect to see more artists exploiting their relationships with other big-name acts to rapidly put together killer exclusve lineups. Then, watch them sell out shows using their greatest marketing tools- themselves.  Equally important is their adaptability in response to the explosion of streaming services. Gone are the days of signing with labels, getting a fat advance, and pushing an album during a world tour. Finally, artists are taking their cues to shift toward independence all while reshaping the future of EDM in the process. Honestly, a producer launching a label is no surprise as the industry’s been consistently trending in that direction for decades. Just this past year alone, industry giants like RL Grime, DJ Snake, Kayzo, Kygo, and Nightmare & Slander all started labels. Conversely, a new trend gaining traction has artists abandoning labels altogether. With this maneuver, artists release content themselves, directly to the consumer via online record stores like BandCamp and Beatport. With royalties set for a mandatory increase this may culminate with artists forming direct partnerships with streaming services. It’s the perfect compromise and solution to the growing problem of the disparity between content usage and artist compensation.Recent studies suggest earnings are quickly dropping for artists and protection for intellectual property (IP) is intensifying as a result. Meanwhile, usage of and profits for streaming services are at an all-time high. In a shocking turn, the European Union (EU) enacted the Copyright in the Digital Single Market Directive. With this law, we’ll likely see artists and content creators pitted against the various internet platforms. According to the US Chamber of Commerce, as recently as 2017 most EU countries have relatively poor copyright protection ratings. EU countries including Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands fall outside the top 45 in the International IP Index. It rates a country’s protection of intellectual property. Charged with fortifying creators’ negotiating power, the European Parliament said this about the measure:  In the US, support is growing for the CASE Act and battle lines are already being drawn. The bill, introduced on May 1, would make it easier and cheaper for creators to make copyright infringement claims. Furthermore, it would allow artists to recoup damages of up to $30,000 per incident. Besides that, the ruling of the Copyright Royalties Board (CRB) will increase royalties by 44% over the next five years.In response, Spotify, Google, Pandora, and Amazon are teaming up to appeal the CRB’s decision. All four are at risk to devastating amounts of litigation. Particularly Spotify, who only recently posted its first-ever quarterly profits, had no choice but to appeal despite the backlash. David Israelite, the president of the National Music Publishers Association, called appeals of the ruling, “…a war on songwriters.” Seemingly a war may very well be on the horizon with huge implications for how we consume music and information. Artists  be compensated fairly for their work. However, deciding who should foot the bill will surely rock the future of EDM to its core.Although it seems like EDM has already reached all corners of society, there’re still a few major areas of opportunity. Of these, emerging markets is the most striking and several event producers and artists are already staking their claim. Developing nations are currently rife with opportunities which labels and artists alike should be looking to cash in on. Namely, Latin America and Asia are bright spots for the future of the industry.  It’s been a big year for events in Latin America following the successes of  EDC Mexico and Venezuela Live Aid. Combine that with the boom in Latin music ‘s popularity and the huge potential for growth is revealed. Tomorrowland has clearly taken notice by announcing J Balvin as one of the headliners for the popular event. Alesso has a passion for the region and performed at EDC Mexico, Venezuela Live Aid, and Carnivál in Brazil too. Furthermore, his new mixtape series and Netflix América Latina appearance emphasize his recognition of the possibilities the region represents.  The biggest names, spanning multiple industry sectors are also now setting their sights on Asia. Consider EDC and Ultra Music Festival both launching Asian versions of the popular US festivals. This expansion into Korea and Japan is an obvious sign of things to come within the industry. Equally important is the attention which India is getting as well. Spotify is quietly making its own power grab by increasing support for its platforms in India. Meanwhile, DJ Snake is attempting to tap into the 1.5 billion person market by launching his label in Mumbai. From this, there’s no doubt that the emerging markets will have a major role in shaping the future of EDM.  One of the unfortunate things that have dominated the headlines is the loss of some of EDM’s finest. Avicii’s passing is sill causing the industry’s realization of losing its brightest star at the height of his popularity. In March, one of the industry’s oldest legends Keith Flint was taken in the same manner. This forces us all into an inevitable discussion- Are we taking the mental health of our artists seriously enough? Besides the untimely ending to careers, we must be more considerate of the effects the limelight causes within the industry. For instance, in May Cookie Monsta withdrew from his tour due to issues with mental health. It’s not clear whether or not years of performing is exacerbating the problem. However, it is fairly clear that his mental health inhibits his ability to put on his best shows.  Check out his full Facebook post here: Another prime example is what happened with Getter nearly ending his career due to bullying from the fans. While not necessarily directly related to his mental health, it reminds us of the fragility of the minds of superstars. Moreover, it reminds us that they too are only human. Just months ago, Laidback Luke highlighted this in an interview wtih Business Insider saying this: “People will judge me, my appearance, the things I say. That adds up a little bit with the pressure of the world leaning on you.”  Blasterjaxx and Benga have also come forward speaking out about the issue and how it’s become a major industry problem. Likewise, a recent study shows nearly 75% of independent artists suffer from some form of mental health problems. With that level of occurrence, it’s now without question one of the most formative issues surrounding the future of EDM. Hopefully, the industry continues to take steps to curtail this negative trend.  It’s been a rough year for the huge festivals that have become icons of the dominance of the EDM industry. Ultra Music Festival and Burning Man, two industry giants, have suffered very public setbacks recently. Certainly, these festivals are the hallmarks of what EDM festivals represent. Indeed, each of their unique struggles will shape how we approach festivals in the future. Additionally, some of the post-event photos we are starting to see circulate every year are not very pretty. Regarding Ultra, the world renown Miami mainstay suffered not one but two lawsuits leading up to the 2019 festivities. The first, attacking the dominance of the festival in the region with an anti-trust suit. The second, spurred by local residents looking to prevent the festival from moving into their neighborhood. This was  UMF was already forcibly removed from its downtown home due to resident’s complaints. As for Burning Man, the location is not of issue here however the environmental impact of the event . At least, that’s the argument the local government highlights in its environmental impact statement. As of this writing, much of Burning Man’s future remains in jeopardy. If the suggested changes are implemented, the Burn as we know and love it would be gone forever.  From this it’s clear that the future of the festival will change how we as music lovers will consume EDM. Festivals across the globe must clean up their acts and start to be more forward thinking about sustainability. Similarly, they’ll need to consider new ways to coexist with their host communities for long periods of time. If not, they may wind up facing a fate similar to Australia’s Defqon 1 or Georgia’s Orange Crush.In the early 2000’s something created a huge shift in EDM- The birth of the super club. The skyrocketing popularity of ‘90s rave culture brought techno and house music into the mainstream. Along with that came commercialization of the industry. Whenever night clubs or even larger venues begin capitalizing on a booming market it creates a noticeable change. In this case, the consumption of dance music shifted from raves and warehouses to night clubs and arenas. Suddenly, huge night clubs with massive sound systems, dedicated to EDM, can be found on every corner. Outside of huge festival-grounds, this is where we find most live-dance music. However, to the dismay of many a club-head, we’re seeing some troubling trends. Over the past several months, one-by-one, some of the industry’s hottest spots are closing down. In October last year, The Mid in Chicago is one of the first big dominoes to fall. Suffering the same fate are San Francisco’s  Mezzanine, Miami’s Ora, and New York’s Output and Cielo. Shocking the EDM system, Beta Nightclub of Denver regretfully closes its dance floors too (set to reopen soon). Truly mind boggling is the news of Intrigue of Las Vegas closing its doors. Furthermore, this alarming tendency knows no borders with closures of Uniun in Toronto, Club 92 in Berlin, and England’s Tokyo. What does this mean for EDM’s future? Possibly, the popularity of EDM could make a complete nose dive. Some reports say that youths are in search of less extravagant experiences. Although, the rising popularity of EDM may indicate otherwise. Most likely what’s taking place is that we’re seeing the party move back underground to warehouses and do-it-yourself locations. It seems as though the industry is reaching the peak of commercialization. Thus, it’s not surprising that the industry is revisiting its underground roots. As a result, from Los Angeles to Europe, underground spots are popping up all over the place. In like fashion to ‘90s raves shaping EDM, this warehouse renaissance will surely shape EDM in the years to come. Of all the formative topics affecting the future of EDM, diversity influences the industry’s ability to maintain its popularity most. We see genres like hip-hop and R&B, typically less diverse, fluctuate in popularity depending on the climate in the industry. Conversely, the pop and rock genres, which consistently rank highest in popularity, have embraced diversity in an ongoing basis. According to the International Music Summit (IMS) report, EDM has breached the top three in popularity for the first time. From this it’s clear that electronic music must embrace diversity to maintain its place on the pedestal. The IMS report highlights one aspect of diversity that EDM may already be cashing in on- Women. Charlotte de Witte, Amelie Lens, and Nina Kraviz were all in the top five most booked DJ’s. From this, it’s fairly obvious that continuing to increase bookings of female artists is a smart move for the industry. In fact, 150+ festivals have signed on to do just that by increasing female bookings to 50% by 2022. Berlin EDM legend Camea  Hoffman encapsulated this eloquently in an interview with Indie Magazine. “Now, women are actually getting proper peak time headlining slots at huge festivals and it’s amazing to watch it happen in my life time, and I’m so happy to have been a part of paving the way for that.” Further illustrating the importance of diversity, we should look at Coachella. Granted, several not so favorable headlines come out of Indio each year but there’re still lessons to be learned here. The festival’s greatest success is most likely it’s diverse lineup. Coachella continues to build a very diverse bill of artists with varying backgrounds, styles and musical influences. It’s reflective of the types of events EDM event organizers will need to put together to keep the crowds growing. Above all, the future of EDM depends on increasing inclusiveness just as other genres have been able to do. Looking back on the year so far, so much is changing in the scene. Most importantly, EDM continues to grow in popularity and new artists and festivals continue to break through. Luckily, we have a thorough list of topics to focus on as the development of our beloved industry continues. Keep it locked here as we continue to deliver the hottest news affecting the future of EDM.",articles11,"['Riot Ten', 'DJ Diesel', 'Expect', 'Namely', 'Netflix América Latina\xa0', 'Korea', 'Japan', 'EDM’s', 'Likewise', 'Burning Man', 'Burning Man', 'EDM- The', 'EDM’s', 'Amelie Lens', 'I’m', 'Luckily']"
"After an unexpected last minute location change for Ultra Singapore just weeks ago, it looks as if Ultra Europe may face a similar issue. The summer festival takes place July 12-14 in the beautiful city of Split, Croatia. Since 2014, Ultra Europe has taken place in the massive Poljud Stadium but recent conversations show signs that the future of the festival will be elsewhere. Radio Split announced late last week that the festival would likely be moved to the RNK Split stadium. Additionally, Ultra organizers have reportedly not been able to sign an agreement for Poljud Stadium, so alternative venues would be looked at to ensure the event would still happen. “I believe we will have quality information next week… We are looking for a win-win situation in which everyone will be satisfied…”Overall, the main conversation is between Hajduk, Split’s professional football team and Ultra. In previous years at Poljud Stadium, the thousands of Ultra festival goers, have left a toll on the grass field. By the end of the festival, the field was unusable for future games and would require about 2 million kuna to replace. Unfortunately, the new lawn failed to arrive on time last summer, resulting in lost revenue to the sports team. Who would agree to pay for the new field, Ultra or Hajduk?Hajduk believed Ultra would take responsibility over the condition of the field and stadium. On the other hand, Ultra likely wanted to avoid paying millions for a new field every summer. Stay tuned, as an official statement on the future of Ultra Europe, will arrive sometime next week. All we can say for certain, is that Ultra will stay in Croatia this year.",articles11,"['… We', '…”Overall', 'Split’s']"

It’s not the beautiful rainbow shape we expected, so what do we think of it?Due to significant structural issues, the previous entranceway was dismantled and burned. This new design took its place.

"All the fans were excited for the return of Swedish House Mafia after they announced their return. However they’ve recently cancelled Ultra Korea last minute on the day of and Sebastian Ingrosso didn’t show up for the B2B with Steve Angello in Las Vegas. Since then, rumors and theories have came up regarding their cancellation.

Tinderbox, Ultra Europe, Tomorrowland, and Creamfields are in jeopardy based on that rumor. Yesterday, Steve Angello posted on his Instagram story stating that there’s a lot of fake news out there. Although he didn’t state what’s the fake news, he’s most likely pointing fingers at the supposed deal.However, Swedish House Mafia has made no comments about their cancellation for Ultra Korea or apologized to their fans.

Guests were treated to a particularly special showing by UK legend Mr. G, who made his USA debut, as well as intimate performances by the likes of Amelie Lens, Jamie xx, James Murphy, and Danny Tenaglia— just to name a few. Each act brought their absolute A-game, making for an impressively satisfying soundtrack all weekend long. Matching the music was the natural beauty of Holiday Mountain itself; lush greenery surrounded the stages, setting spirits even higher as the sets unfolded. The energy was truly infectious!As with any festival, there were, of course, a couple of hurdles faced; Rain hit the event on Day 1, leaving only the most dedicated fans behind at the fest. Hats off to the Gather team, who handed out ponchos to those that stayed behind.

Lastly, we can expect some mainstage tunes courtesy of DJ Snake, Deorro, & Alan Walker.Although the lineup is out, we can further expect more artist to be announced, as the Campground Silent Disco lineup has yet to be announced. This year’s Nocturnal Wonderland will again feature camping, and if EDCLV is any indication of what Insomniac has planned, we’re all in for a treat.2019 will mark the last year that Nocturnal Wonderland is held at the Glen Helen Amphitheater.  This is due, mostly in part to recent noise ordinances that were put into place. These ordinances will curb the playing of music past midnight, which is exactly what events like these are built around. With Nocturnal being America’s longest running rave, it will be interesting to see how Insomniac sends off this iconic venue.

In the past, when fans attended his shows, security would take each attendee’s phone and use a sticker to cover the phone’s camera.By enforcing this, Lane 8’s mission was to encourage his fans, and others, to put away their phones during the show and focus on the music, experience, and be present in the moment. This plan made its rounds on the Internet and was widely accepted by many.Now, Lane 8 has announced his next plan for his fans to connect on a personal level. He has created a quarterly digital newsletter that his fans, who have supported him over the years or are interested in Lane’s 8 future happenings, that they will receive. The newsletter will have exclusive content and news that hasn’t ‘happened’ anywhere else. He is hoping to connect more with his fans and finding a way to give a more wholesome ‘Thank you’ than he ever has before. Another twist to his idea is that fans will also receive snail mail. Yes, you read that right. Opening your mailbox one day and seeing a personal letter from Lane 8. There will even be some physical gifts for some who sign up.“Some of those who sign up will get an actual physical gift in the mail once a quarter. The gift will be exclusive to the fan club.

Soon after the introductory phase, the production pulls its punches with a metallic and choir-esque stab. Building upon the track’s audio reduction, a pitched and sharp synth lead overpowers. Moreover, the song retains its essence as it drives further leading into a bridge variation. As a result, a pulsing deep rhythm pushes into a stripped version of the bridge. Coming to its conclusion, the chorus brings forth a defined and hushed synth with a resonant metallic property to it.Catch Flume performing in an area near you here.

"Were you ever watching a YouTube video on your phone while wondering what song was playing in the background? In fact, You NEEDED to know what song was playing, but you had no way to figure it out? Well, Shazam (on Android devices) now has you covered. The new feature called ‘Pop-up Shazam’ is included in the latest Android version of the app. It ‘listens’ to audio playing through headphones and other apps while Shazam is working in the background. Game-changer? I think so. This change is arriving recently after Apple acquired Shazam for $400 million, a deal which closed earlier this year. Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music shared his gratitude for the acquisition mentioning in a statement:  “Apple and Shazam have a long history together. Shazam was one of the first apps available when we launched the App Store and has become a favorite app for music fans everywhere. With a shared love of music and innovation, we are thrilled to bring our teams together to provide users even more great ways to discover, experience and enjoy music.”Founded in 1999, Shazam has come a long way and is already reaping the benefits of this acquisition. Not only will this new feature be extremely practical with the app, Shazam removed all of those pesky ads as of last year too. In 2014, Apple also acquired Beats by Dre for a reported $3.2 billion. Besides headphones and audio accessors, this included the subscription-based Beats Music streaming service. As I reported earlier this week, Apple surpassed Spotify in paid U.S subscribers, proving this acquisition fruitful in getting Apple on the music streaming map. Stayed tuned to see what Shazam has in store for the future. ",articles11,"['Android', 'Apple’s']"

"Spotify is expanding to a fresh new radio app called Stations. After recently announcing “Social Listening“, Spotify is continuing to change the game. Although the Stations app is different from Spotify’s main app, Stations launched in Australia last year, and is available to anyone with a Spotify account. Spotify is hoping to create a more ‘radio-like experience’ for these users. Unlike the Spotify app, Stations brings back an element of surprise when listening, and opening both your mind, and ears to new artists, much like when listening to the radio. (you know, that useless metal box in the dashboard of your car that gets in the way of your aux cable) With this in mind, perhaps this is a move to increase the Spotify listener base? Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journa reported that Apple surpassed Spotify in paid U.S. subscriptions. According to the report, Apple Music had 28 million paying subscribers in the US in February, compared to Spotify’s 26 million paying subscribers. Although, Spotify still remains on top with overall listeners in the US and internationally. With a simpler interface, Stations is designed to reduce the steps to get to your music. Less decisions, less scrolling through playlists, and “saved” songs; the app does all the work for you. The description from the Google Play store feels very similar to the Pandora app: “Easily create stations for all the music you love, all for free.With the world’s music at your fingertips, finding the right thing to play can feel like a challenge. Stations gets you to music instantly — no searching or typing needed. As Stations learns more about what you like, it creates stations packed with the music you love, made just for you.Stations is an experiment by Spotify, and we’re always looking for ways to make it better.”Will Spotify revolutionize the music industry again?

"Five years ago Arne Quinze built the ‘One World’ bridge for the 10th edition of Tomorrowland. The bridge symbolized the connection between people and bridging their differences. This week, De Schorre Park in Boom, received another piece of artwork.  Danish artist Thomas Dambo has built a ‘Magical Troll Forest.’ It is to honor the 15th year of Tomorrowland. There are a total of seven trolls protecting the park. One located right near the main stage. Attendees will have the opportunity to find each troll hidden in the trees. Each sculpture is partaking in a different action. One troll is making a necklace while two others stare into the sky looking at clouds. One is gathering stones while another carves figures into a totem pole. The idea behind the whole thing is actually pretty cool. All seven of them are working together to build a large watchtower that houses ‘The Holy Troll.’ You can even find this watchtower deep in the forest that offers a beautiful view of the whole park. The trolls are in between 13 and 26 feet high and even have their own names: Una, Jeuris, Kamiel, Mikil, Hannes, Arvid, and Nora. Thomas Dambo had this to say about the project:“Hopefully, when they stand there, visitors will realize why nature reserves like these are precious and need to be protected…With my work, I want to show what kind of gigantic things you can build with waste that nobody wants anymore.”All the creations are made out of recycled wooden material. If you begin your search for all seven trolls you will find it is not so easy. But, that is the fun part. You will have to walk all around the park to achieve the goal. Happy trails!

"Everyone’s favorite slug SNAILS is back at it again and this time he’s bringing dubstep heavyweight Krimer along for the ride. Known for his rather guttural take on bass music, the Vomitstep king is not holding back. Today, we bring you his new collaboration ‘Jackhammer’ alongside the Montreal-based Krimer. If you’re a bass-head, you definitely wanna check this out.The track starts out quickly with some epic brass stabs, that further develop into some sick bass hits. After a gnarly snare buildup and a heavily distorted vocal, we get the drop. This is one of those tracks where the title perfectly fits. This is because the screeches and wobbles remind us exactly of ‘Jackhammer’. If you’re a fan of Snail’s take on Dubstep or just into the harsher Dubstep subgenres like riddim & company, you don’t want to miss this one.

"Marketing is everything when you’re famous, and DJ Khaled is one we’ve seen among the heavy hitters that want rankings. According to the New York Times, “bundles” help artists boost their rankings on Billboard’s charts. This is because bundles cost way more than the price of an album and allow the artist to claim higher sales. An album costs what? $10-20? While an album “bundled” with merchandise can push that sale to over $100. Whether it is a package deal, merchandise, or concert tickets you can bet that’ll pump your sales numbers by a lot. Travis Scott earned his rank with his  bundle. Honestly, can you see the problem with this sytem?Two weeks ago, DJ Khaled and Tyler The Creator came at us with Father of Asahd and Igor. With clothing, “Vote Igor” lawn signs or energy drinks offered on Shop.com, who’s to say which is the legit winner?The results came in and Billboard ultimately decided that DJ Khaled will not be making it. His website crossed a line by encouraging unauthorized bulk sales of energy drinks to literally pump up his sales numbers. His marketing came came with a push to buy 12 packages and to “push DJ Khaled and Market America (the parent company) to the top”.Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group president, Deanna Brown, stated: In this particular instance, we saw an organization encouraging purchases among their members by promising them material and organizational benefits.Turn Up and Awake energy drinks are still for sale, along with an insightful message to all entertainment moguls. Basically, they need this energy drink to stay focused all day. “Stay woke with Awake.”In a series of industry meetings, there may be some changes coming to how Billboard tabulates their charts. Khaled has not earned enough to be #1 now, but he may be in this for the endgame. Frustrated on social media, he is threatening to sue Billboard over their decision of ranking him at #3.

According to Music Unfiltered, Chattahoochee Hills City Manager Robbie Rokovitz will meet with the founder of Imagine, Glenn Goodhand. The meeting is to discuss moving the three-day festival to Bouckaert’s Farm in 2021. With a property at over 8,000 acres, Bouckaert’s Farm certainly has the space for a festival of this capacity. Some of the large-scale events held at this venue in previous years include Tomorrowworld, Echo Music Project, CounterPoint and Many Rivers Festival. There have been concerns that festival attendees have voiced about the venue in the past, ranging from parking issues to improper internal organization. In 2015, Tomorrowworld made headlines when a rainstorm turned the grounds into mud pits. Additionally, festival-goers were left stranded when leaving the festival, as they waited for promised shuttles that never arrived. If this venue change is confirmed, it will be Imagine Festival’s third move since its debut event in 2014. There will certainly be plans put into place to avoid any mishaps that happened at Bouckaert’s Farm in previous years.

"In Porter Robinson‘s regular fashion, the artist ignited the crowd at Ultra Korea with a DJ set. The show was facilitated through him taking over Martin Garrix‘s slot due to an ankle injury. Within a matter of minutes, Porter swapped from the Virtual Self moniker into his self-named project. To our luck, a full recording of the set managed to surface online. Setting the stage for a bright start, he monologues over ethereal background music;“Hey Guys! My name is Porter Robinson. I am also virtual self, and tonight was my very first time ever playing as both Virtual Self and Porter Robinson on the same stage. I just want to say I’m so so happy that I was able to do it in Korea with you guys, it was so much fun. I really think Korea is my favorite place to play, you guys give so much energy. I just want to say thank you so much, let’s have a great time.Pads simmer as a cut from ‘Shelter‘ plays, driving into Porter’s remix of ‘The Thrill‘ and vocal chops from ‘The Mother We Share‘ by CHVRCHES.

"You just knew there was gonna be a second shoe to drop for Woodstock 50 right? The festival has been hanging on by a thread almost since the day it was announced. It was scheduled to take place on August 16-18 at a racetrack called Watkins Glen International. As soon as the lineup was announced the trouble began. Rumors of cancellation have swirled ever since, and most onlookers knew this day would come. The festival was canceled by its investor company, and everybody declared it dead. Miraculously, Woodstock 50 won in court to uncancel itself and gained a new investor, Oppenheimer & Co. Even with all of that luck, the festival just lost its hallowed venue and its production company. Watkins Glen International terminated the site license and will not host the festival. Within an hour the festival’s producer CID Entertainment, who had been hired to handle camping, travel packages and transport, pulled out as well. The festival is planned for August 16-18.

"The perfectly choreographed reunion of Swedish House Mafia hit some major snags last week. First, Ingrosso was a no show at XS Las Vegas then most recently, SHM cancelled their Ultra Korea set at the very last minute. Couple that with a rumor of more cancellations, the question everyone is asking in EDM circles is what exactly is going on with Swedish House Mafia? A visa issue for Ingrosso is being cited as the reason for the XS & Ultra Korea sets cancellations. But according to an article from DJ MAG Germany, there may be more to the story than meets the eye. The article alleges that the supergroup has signed an exclusive deal with Live Nation for a stadium tour. The allegation is that Live Nation will lean on the trio to cancel any festival appearances that do not profit Live Nation directly or indirectly. The article also indicates that more festival cancellations may happen to make room for the stadium tour among other things. Take this with a grain of salt, because there are not currently any indications that any other shows are at risk.In the same DJ MAG Germany article there is a mention of some sort of a new conflict between the three members. Ingrosso fails to show up to Vegas for whatever reason, and so Angello and Axwell refuse to show for Korea as retribution. 2013 flashbacks anyone? This is slightly awkward considering they just got back together after so many years. They do however give us reassurances that SHM will not be breaking up (again). The article directly states: The internet, of course, has been doing its own digging. The sleuths over at Reddit and the Axwell forum have a different idea about Ultra Korea. They claim the Ultra Korea cancellation came from a disagreement over the stage between SHM management & Ultra Korea organizers. As you know the reunion tour has used a very iconic stage setup, which actually was first seen at Ultra Miami in 2018. The 3 large LED walls with the riser DJ platform and the 3 circles above. You might remember that Ultra Miami turned off their own logo and other stage features to let the trio do their thing. The rumor goes that SHM had similarly specific requirements for the Korea stage and they refused to perform when the stage did not fully comply. If this is true, it’s sure to leave a bad taste in fans’ mouths as Ultra had clearly compromised for them the three large circular lights at the top and a custom DJ booth riser. Neither of these ended up being used the entire weekend. The huge solid screen at the back was exactly like the ones at their arena shows too. This ultimately resulted in Ultra offering full refunds for day pass holders and 1-day refunds for 3-day pass holders. The bottom line is there is a lot of stuff being said and not a lot of confirmation for anything. There has been no word from Live Nation or the boys yet about the alleged “stadium Tour”. Same goes for their Ultra Korea set, all we have is that it was canceled due to “Unforeseen Circumstances”. As far as renewed conflict between the boys goes, well time will tell about that. Ultimately, out of all the show cancellations and squabbles, the ones that lose are the fans. The same fans that spent $80 for a plain white shirt with a date written on it. the same fans that are spending thousands of dollars in hopes of seeing their favorite group live. The next planned SHM show is Tinderbox Festival in Denmark on June 26. There has been no concrete statement from the Swedish House Mafia team yet so keep your eyes peeled because we definitely will.

"Since his retirement at 52-years old, former heavyweight champ, Mike Tyson, announces some major additions for his newfound marijuana empire. Founding Tyson Holistics in 2016, Tyson announced that he would build a marijuana ranch in 2017. The 400+ acre ranch is still in the works with some huge plans in store. Tyson Ranch is coming soon to Desert Hot Springs, California. It plans to attract tourists with a luxurious marijuana holiday resort, music festival venue, and Tyson University that will focus on the research of marijuana health benefits.  Machine trimmed? Think again. We give our buds all the TLC. #bettercannabis . . . . #cannabiscommunity #weedporn #weed #cannabisA post shared by  Tyson Ranch (@tysonranchofficial) on Tyson Ranch revealed plans for a luxurious resort that hopes to attract a multitude of tourists. Photos show us that there’s a huge 1-hour long lazy river pool surrounding a hotel. There will also be 200 ‘glamping’ units spread across the resort. While still in development, Tyson Ranch aims to welcome the growing cannabis tourism industry. Guests will be able to smoke weed pretty much anywhere on the premises, except in areas where liquor is for sale, according to the law. Prior to breaking grounds as Tyson Ranch, Tyson held Kind Music Festival earlier this year in February. KMF featured headlining acts like Miguel and A$AP Ferg. This is where attendees got a taste of what Tyson Ranch would soon have in-store for its future amphitheater. Tyson looks forward to building a full venue for music festivals for many events to come. Could this be the next-gen ‘Weedchella’? Tyson proclaims that weed has helped him end years of substance abuse. Tyson’s business partner, Rob Hickman, states in an interview with GQ,  With that being said, Tyson’s goal is to develop a research facility aimed at educating the mass on the healing benefits of cannabis and CBD. Tyson Ranch holds a high-standard of naturally sourcing their marijuana. This procedure includes indoor cultivated strains, a 30-day curing process, and hand-trimming their product to make sure that it is pesticide free. The university will also educate people on how to grow weed and how to properly conduct business. This is great news for the 420 community and we definitely can’t wait for the development of Tyson Ranch and all of its amenities being carried out. Tyson Ranch’s website also features a portion where you can “sign up for the keys” to the resort here.

"Ever been to the Mezzanine in San Francisco? It’s the largest women owned club that has supported acts like Galantis, Simon Patterson, and more. Now, they need your help in delaying their eviction.  At the end of last year, the institution announced they would be shutting their doors the following year. Longtime building owners, The Chritton family, worked hard to extend their tenured lease. What more could they do to ease the closing? Well not much, since they reneged those agreements and the saga continues down a darker path.A mailer from the Mezzanine camp dating back to November presented bleak news. The Chrittons tried to present a new lease with unknowingly unreachable terms. This past January, they reached out to the club owner, Deborah Jackman, for a Letter of Intent to extend their lease beyond eviction point.“A letter of intent was sent to Mezzanine ensuring the venue would be given the extension they were hoping for, with the added possibility of …a newly promised closing date of January 31st, 2020″The venue acted on good faith and continued booking events throughout Fall and Winter, waiting on their finalized fate. Although it has been a pillar of San Francisco nightlife and the Bay Area dance community since 2002. Grimmer news followed on May 1 with the Chrittons pulling their end of the bargain out from Jackman. The club needed to be out of the building by October 2019, no rhyme or reason. This unexpected turn of events will greatly damage the financials to the already struggling venue. Needing to shut down and cancel all of its proposed events this year is a serious pitfall. For anyone that has ever supported the club, please support them in their fight to retain the original move-out date of January 2020!More of this story may develop and we will continue to update you.",articles11,"['Mezzanine', 'Galantis', 'Simon Patterson', 'Deborah Jackman', 'Mezzanine', 'Grimmer']"

With the event happening June 8-9, this news came well past the last minute.The event has been relocated from ULTRA Park to B2 Sands Expo and Convention Centre at Marina Bay Sands. The biggest concern now is the move from an outdoor venue to an indoor venue with smaller capacity. Sadly, it is bad weather that forced the venue to change. Check out these photos of the swamped outdoor venue at ULTRA Park:While festival-goers are skeptical, event management maintains that nothing has changed. All originally scheduled headliners will be there to enjoy the pyrotechnics and laser shows. Some main stage acts include Martin Garrix, Porter Robinson, Skrillex, and Axwell.A spokesperson for Ultra Singapore 2019 said the Marina Bay Sands Expo Centre was always the contingency plan. They also had this to add:Only time will tell if Ultra Singapore 2019 will live up to it’s word. However, fans remain nervous that they won’t be able to deliver on some lofty expectations. Regardless of what goes down, they seem to have pulled a rabbit out of the hat. Having attended many indoor events, as long as security and sound quality are up to speed, nobody should panic. At the end of the day, fans will see their favorite DJs performing as promised. We call that a win.",articles11,"['Martin Garrix', 'Porter Robinson']"

"Still coming off his  album release, Amon Tobin is introducing his ‘Only Child Tyrant‘ project. Debuting it, the ‘Monkey Box‘ single attaches itself as the first release from the project’s  album. As the album is coming right out of the gate, you can expect it to be up on July 26.Taking a look into ‘Monkey Box’, Only Child Tyrant immediately exemplifies the fact it’s based within indie rock. Brushing aggressive, intense and acidic tones, Amon’s new work pushes itself into existence. In the artist’s own words;“I’ve often made my favorite things when I wasn’t overthinking things. This record came about over a period of time between things I may well have been overthinking. It’s fun to program drums that sound live and fake at the same time, to make synths sound like guitars and have guitars played by robots. My enjoyment of these processes became a complete sound with its own personality, one that needed its own name. I hope you’ll like it as much or at least nearly as much as I did making it.” Topping off this package of news from the project, Old Child Tyrant is partnering with Bandcamp to press vinyls. ‘Time To Run’ is available for pre-order here. Commenting on it, Amon Tobin exclaimed; “Over at Nomark we’ve been trying a few different things with releases. What’s been surprising in the best possible way is the enduring love out there for proper LP’s. Really though.. it’s been one of those where it turns out the things we love are what you want too. Brilliant. now, we’re a tiny operation and the logistics for vinyl manufacture are no small task. So imagine how thrilled we were to discover that bandcamp have come up with a solution where I can spend more time making music and you’re not left at the mercy of eBay scalpers for a record we couldn’t afford to press more of. It’s a beautiful thing and I hope you’ll get behind it.”",articles11,"['Amon Tobin', 'Amon’s', 'Amon Tobin', 'What’s', 'eBay']"

"Last April, the Dance Music community lost one of its greatest pioneers, Avicii. Avicii, whose real name was Tim Bergling passed away with a rumored 150+ unreleased tracks. Many of these might not ever see the light of day. Luckily for us, it was revealed that a posthumous album titled “would be released, containing a sizable 12 tracks. It is easy to say that 12 tracks are just a drop in the bucket compared to the amount of unreleased music actually out there. However, being able to listen to new Avicii music period, is a great thing. In the buildup to the album release, the team in charge of Avicii’s music decided to release a “The Story Behind” series. Below is that series in all of its glory. If you haven’t listened to “yet, this might be a cool thing to spend some time on, as it truly gives you some insight into his production workflow, as well as how the tracks were completed after his passing.Opening up the series is a video featuring Avicii’s father, Klas Bergling. Klas opens up about when Avicii first started producing, and how natural he seemed to be at it. We also get a couple of words from the President of Universal Music, Nordic region Per Sundin on the planned album release. We’re happy to say this album finally saw the light of day.“Peace Of Mind” features co-producers/co-songwriters Vargas & Lagola who previously worked with Tim on ‘, ‘and many more.

After listening, its easy to see where they are coming from.The second single off of the track, also featuring Vargas & Lagola. In this video, they speak on how the Bergling family wanted the tracks on this album to be as close to the demos as possible. They further elaborate on the production of this track, the societal meaning behind it, and how Chris Martin urged and how he urged Vincent Pontare to sing on the track. It also features a pretty neat violin too.The first single off of ‘, this track features longtime collaborator Aloe Blacc. You might remember him from his track ‘which charted worldwide.

He opens up about how his music has progressed, and how at one point his music was a “very bubble gum trance”. Seeing the trajectory of his career, it’s insane to think he didn’t come out of the womb a master. This track is a little bass heavy, so it definitely sticks out.What is perhaps the most looked forward to track on the whole album, is his track ‘‘. It turns out that this track came about during his sessions with the legendary band Coldplay. In this video, we get some words from Neil Jacobson, who is the head from Geffen Records on how it came about, and the urgency from Coldplay/ Chris Martin after Avicii’s passing.While it is a fantastic day to be an Avicii fan, no amount of music can bring him back.

"This is not a hallucination! Oakland has become the second US city to allow the use of magic mushrooms and other natural psychedelics. It’s a step forward, but the full green light hasn’t been given yet. It’s still illegal to commercially distribute, sell, or purchase shrooms.In a city resolution on Tuesday, the Oakland City Council voted to decriminalize the adult use and possession of “entheogenic” plants and fungi. This includes psilocybin (found in shrooms) and other plant-based substances like ayahuasca, peyote, cacti, and iboga. This approval comes a month after Denver approveda similar measure. However, psychedelic plants and shrooms still remain illegal under California state and federal law, so don’t expect to buy or sell magic mushrooms at your local dispensaries just yet.  We won!! 6/6 unanimous decision to #decriminalizenature in #Oakland! Thank you Oakland city council and community!!! @oakland @decriminalizenature . 🍄🍵🌵🌿✨#decriminalizenatureA post shared by  SF Psychedelic Society (@psychedelicsocietysf) on The approval comes after people testified that psychedelics helped them overcome depression, drug addiction, and post-traumatic stress disorder. City councilman Noel Gallo introduced the resolution in hopes of allowing Oakland police to focus on more serious crimes. With this law’s passing, Oakland law enforcement will no longer use city funds to prioritize or investigate psychoactive plant users. However, it will certainly be illegal to drive under the influence of these drugs. Multiple amendments also added to this resolution advise that these natural psychedelics aren’t for everyone. People with serious problems should seek professional help first.  Many speakers at the hearing mentioned the spiritual healing benefits and historical usage of substances like ayahuasca and peyote. Noel Gallo’s agenda report explained how peyote has been used in Native American communities for centuries. According to a controlled substance study at John Hopkins, psilocybin mushrooms have shown a low risk for abuse and proven medicinal benefits as well. “Half of my family is Native American. I grew up with my grandmother, and those plants were visible in our backyard. We didn’t have a Walgreens in the neighborhood.” When his nephew was severely injured in the Iraq War, Gallo said that “some of these plants were able to help him get his life back together.” Statewide initiatives continue to brew in this “psychedelic renaissance” that could sweep the rest of California and Oregon soon. Carlos Plazola, chairman of DNO, stated that Advocates are continuing to push for a more rustic approach to remedying mental health issues. We’ve seen cannabis legalization in some states that have opened the gates to more studies and opportunities. Shrooms were made illegal due to political reasons in the 1960s. Could these new monumental decisions be the start to a new era of medicinal reformation? Thanks, Oakland, for decriminalizing shrooms.

"Congratulations are in order for Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner. They tied the knot in Vegas, and thanks to Diplo, had the whole thing live-streamed. However, that notion turned into a slight media crisis as the couple and producer went back and forth. Here to set the record straight is the Diplodocus himself. On June 3, Ryan Seacrest opened the gates for the three-time Grammy winner to dispense on what happened. Is Joe Jonas actually mad at Wes for live-streaming his surprise Las Vegas wedding to the Queen of the North? Well, with a new Jonas Brothers track on the way, we hope it was all in good fun.After the live-stream, Joe poked fun at Diplo being caught up in IG way more than a 13-year-old. Wes refuted saying Jonas’s “fit” ruined the wedding. In its entirety, the spontaneous ceremony led him to believe it wasn’t anything serious. Seems like miscommunication on everyone’s part, as Jonas later apologized for how blown up things got. I didn’t know it was a serious wedding. I was hanging out with [Joe Jonas] after the Billboard Awards… and I was, like, ‘This is crazy. Let me record this.’ And there was mad people with cameras! I didn’t know I was, like, the only person recording this thing. – DiploIt has been made clear that there is no bad blood between the two. England may love the drama, but we can still expect that collaboration between the JoBros and Diplo. Wes roamed all around with country music and other weird shenanigans.

"It has been 1.2 years since the death of one of the biggest EDM artists to ever live, Avicii. Today is the release of his highly anticipated posthumous album ‘TIM‘. Hearing the album, the emotions as a fan are the exact same ones from the moment we found out of his passing. It is impossible to listen through ‘TIM’ without getting emotional, goosebumps, and/or happiness. The posthumous album by the Swede contains IDs from previous years which were near completion. The likes of Carl Falk, Vargas & Lagola, Albin Nedler, Kristoffer Fogelmark, and other producers took those tracks to the home stretch to deliver the completed product: The first song of the album features recurring vocalists and producers of ‘TIM’, Vargas & Lagola. The anthemic-like track delivers an Arabic vibe with guitars and strings. The track then develops into a laidback drop with a classic string-like Avicii catchy melody. The lyrics, like most of the album, make the listener question Avicii’s feelings and state of mind. In this song, we hear repeatedly: This song is about having a break from the fast-paced society we live in. Overall, Vargas & Lagola’s vocal tone paired with the music provokes an intimate feeling with the listener. At last. The most anticipated song from the album featuring no other than Coldplay‘s front-man Chris Martin. This track is by far one, or the most emotional one on the album. “I think I just died and went to heaven”Those lyrics shocked everyone when the news of Tim’s death surfaced. These type of lyrics are the ones that make the fans realize the troubles he faced. The piano chord progression is probably the most memorable of the album and draws at that classic Avicii style. There was a big debate on the vocals of either having Chris Martin or Simon Aldred. In my opinion, Chris Martin does a spectacular job with the vocal performance. His voice, like in any Coldplay song, is raw and emotional. We can hope, and expect this song to reach high in the charts. The first single from the album to release, ‘SOS’, features incredibly vulnerable lyrics as it sheds light to Tim’s substance abuse. The contrast between the sad lyrics with the happy ‘Caribbean/Arabic’ melody is unique. This track draws towards the pop side of the album. In just 2 months, the single has reached over 100 million streams on Spotify. This seems to be the route the rest of the album will take. There is no better person to have on vocals for this track than Aloe Blacc. A person who has worked with Tim’s biggest records and knows how Tim liked things being done in the studio. The second song from the album to release, ‘Tough Love’, showcases the talent and genius mind of Avicii. Just as he did with his chart-breaking single ‘Wake Me Up‘, Tim pushed the boundaries of genres. By combining an Arabic violin melody with dance elements ‘Tough Love’ delivers the best of both styles. Vargas & Lagola’s vocals fit perfectly into the production in companion with Agnes. The lyrics speak about the ups and downs of a relationship, and how it requires two people to make it work. Just like many who listened to Avicii’s album ‘True‘, people will need more than a single listen for the song to grow in them and be able to fully comprehend the production. ‘Bad Reputation’ was one of the tracks Tim worked on with Carl Falk. The co-producer who took this album to its final stage worked off the chord progression and synth Tim left behind. The song features that plucky tropical house/pop vibe from Avicii’s prior album ‘Stories‘. Moreover, the classic Avicii blues ‘melodic language’ on the melody is what drives the track. Carl Falk finished this track based off on past projects with Tim. Using the same FX, style, and sounds Carl was able to bring Avicii’s sound to ‘Bad Reputation’ featuring Joe Janiak. Recurring singer of the album Joe Janiak appears in another melodic heavy track by Avicii. ‘Ain’t A Thing’ features an uplifting chord progression with a catchy, plucky, short classic Tim melody. This track was written when Tim was trying to find himself and what he wanted to produce. This track is a special one in the album as it is filled with Avicii’s feelings. Moreover, we can hear in the vocal the pure energy and raw emotion Tim was trying to convey. ‘Hold The Line’ is one of the stellar songs from the album as it is a major collaboration with the American rock band A R I Z O N A. The production yells Avicii with the uplifting chord progression, the classic Avicii arp in the background, and unique brassy drop which draws inspiration from the album ‘Stories’. The lyrics in this track are profound, impactful, and personal. Moreover, the lyrics could be a letter to Tim himself: ‘Freak’ is a unique track of the album. Where to start? Composing credits are given to Sam Smith and Bon Iver. Additionally, Tim went back to his music producing roots and sampled a 1950s Japanese song for the main melody of ‘Freak’. The song delivers strong lyrics about awareness of being different. The production delivers the classic Avicii pop chords with an uplifting chord progression in the drop. ‘Freak’ has a similar style to ‘Waiting For Love‘. All in all, this is a star-studded track with composing credits to two huge artists and an infectious melody. Undoubtedly, this track is one of the most experimental ones in the album. This track was written when Tim did not know where to head musically and ended up creating a fusion of different genres. ‘Excuse Me Mr. Sir’ delivers a track combining hip-hop, rock, and electronic elements. With a fast classic Avicii melody and a beautiful acoustic progression, Tim creates a genre-breaking stew. With this track, we see the talent of Vargas & Lagola and how they are able to do anything musically. There is no doubt why Avicii and the duo worked closely together. This song contains one of the most memorable melodies in the album and a fan favorite (as it was previously released as an instrumental). This new re-vamped version of ‘Heart Upon My Sleeve’ contains the amazing voice of Imagine Dragons‘ frontman Dan Reynolds. Furthermore, this new version has a different arrangement than the version from Tim’s first album ‘True’. This atmospheric track delivers an orchestral drop filled with incomparable energy. Matching that energy is Dan’s vocals which will lead this song to the charts.The story behind this song is heartbreaking. ‘Never Leave Me’ was the last song Tim wrote before dying. Just two days before flying to Oman (where he tragically died) Tim, Albin Nedler, and Kristoffer Fogelmark wrote this love song about the fear of goodbyes. ‘Never Leave Me’ is on the chiller side of things in the album in comparison to the other tracks. It takes a modern ballad form and provokes a stream of emotions to run within the listener. This is the last track in the album we see Joe Janiak be part of. The last track of the album features the singer from ‘I Could Be The One‘, Noonie Bao. No better way to close the album than with an emotionally driven vocal written by Tim. Moreover, the track is driven by the fast-paced orchestral riff in the drop with a slower breakdown creating a double-tempo feel. The chord progression in the breakdown will pull at the emotions of the listeners. The idea of this song started with the line:Don’t you love it how it all just fades away?It is sad to see most of these songs from the album were rooted from a dark state of mind. Yet, Tim found a way to make them beautiful. There are no words to describe the beauty of ‘TIM’. The recurring theme of the album is that of someone who is coming back to life and escaping the past. With the lyrics in several songs, we can see this theme which is very fitting for Tim and his past. Furthermore, we hear a unique contrast in some of the songs which contain dark and sad lyrics with a happy musical composition. Undoubtedly, ‘TIM’ features Avicii’s classic melodic textures and fast note melodies. We get a rollercoaster of emotions, energy, and a unique palette of Avicii’s sound. This album feels exactly what Avicii’s next step would have been in his musical career. It is up to the listeners to create their own translation of the lyrics and what they may have meant to Tim. EDMTunes wants to thank the Bergling family, Carl Falk, Vargas & Lagola, Albin Nedler, Kristoffer Fogelmark, and all the people who were involved in the making of ‘TIM’. May his legacy live forever and may his music continue to shine through future generations. All proceeds of the album will be donated to the Tim Bergling Foundation for mental health awareness and suicide prevention.

"His fourth track of 2019, ‘Obvious‘ stands out from Deorro‘s usual style. This is a welcome attempt at widening his musical repertoire. Known for more upbeat singles such as ‘Five Hours‘ and ‘Bring it Back‘, some feared it might transgress from his signature genre. This is not the case as ‘Obvious‘ offers a blend of silky melodies and transcendental vocals. It is not too deep nor too commercial, but a welcome respite in today’s future house scene. Deorro is not the only one experimenting with calmer or deeper features – e.g. Don Diablo‘s ‘Silence‘. Some fans are calling for an instrumental version. For lyrics wise, ‘Obvious‘ is no particular stand out, despite a heartfelt interpretation. A lover’s pursuit and profession is the central theme. The iTunes and Spotify release 4 days ago through Ultra Music was accompanied by a peculiar video. Soft imagery and expressionist frames give a dreamy feel to both clip and song. It shares a great deal with Coldplay‘s ‘Up and Up‘ video in theme and in visuals. All in all, it might not rock the boat this summer, but this track will obviously feature on your midnight playlists or slow dance.",articles11,[]

"It has officially been 7 years since Zedd‘s ‘Spectrum‘ was released. Anton Zaslavski celebrated the anniversary of the track, which arguably launched his career, with a tribute on all platforms.However, although this is something to be excited about, there has also been a gray cloud casted on this happy day.Matthew Koma, who provides the vocals for ‘Spectrum’ and other tracks with Zedd’, posted on social media today a dark description about the years of working with the Grammy-winning producer. ZEDDA post shared by  Matthew Koma (@matthewkoma) on Today, Koma gave fans an inside perspective on what really happened with Zedd’s award winning single ‘Spectrum’; along with many others released under Zedd’s name. “It’s a really sad truth because I’m extremely proud of the work he and I did together… unfortunately my good feelings toward those songs have all but disappeared as they were experienced alongside someone so toxic and self serving that it occupied the space where any happiness could exist.”Koma ended his statement with, “Now, he has plenty of people to write his songs and produce his tracks and help him continue on his trajectory. But I rather work at Starbucks and clean the toilets than ever experience that abusive dynamic again.”Koma hinted at a possible falling out with the producer during the 2018 Twitter feud with Diplo. It did leave many wondering what could have possibly happened. And now we have some understanding on the matter.Not long after Koma came out with this shocking revelation, Zedd’s long time friend and photographer, Rukes seems to chime in and supposedly has a story of his own. Rukes as some of you may know is one of the world’s best DJ photographers and has toured with Zedd in recent years. Commenting on Koma’s Instagram post, Rukes responds to fans stating he has a story of his own but now is not the time to share and that he quit Zedd’s team in 2018. Check out the comments below.We’ll patiently watch to see how this feud unfolds.

Martin was originally slated to appear at Ultra Korea this coming weekend, however, that is canceled as well.Taking his place in the closing slot of the mainstage for Ultra Korea will be Porter Robinson. He tweeted out the news that he will be performing a Porter Robinson DJ set. However, that’s not even the best part. He then added that he was already scheduled to play the festival as his side project, Virtual Self. “that means I’ll be playing two completely different sets in a row on the mainstage!”This is obviously horrible news for Martin Garrix fans, however, it’s great news for fans of Porter Robinson and the festival. And as someone on twitter noted, Virtual Self b2b Porter Robinson is finally a thing.Porter ended his string of tweets by asking Martin to please rest up and feel better. That’s a sentiment that we can surely get behind.

"Last year, Diplo announced that Major Lazer would be putting out its final album this year, effectively ending the group. A few months later, they finally gave us a tease of this fourth and final album. Now, this week it was reported that Jillionaire will be leaving the group and venturing off into the dance music world solo. Diplo has had quite a massive year. He has been working on what seems to be at least—if not more than—five projects. He is also producing the biggest Mad Decent festival to date. And of course, he is apart of the trio that is Major Lazer (which might now be a duo?). Ape Drums was announced as the newest addition to the group. Rumors have swirled around that he was the replacement for Jillionaire. Diplo had this to say about the rumors:“Jillionaire is always part of the team. Ape Drums is helping with production on some tracks (he’s done a few songs with us before) so he is going to tour with us as well…it’s like John Mayer joining the Grateful Dead.”It is quite the confusing time for Major Lazer. But, at least we have a few things cleared up. As for the release date of the fourth album, that is still unknown. Knowing the past music they have produced, we’re sure we are all eager for its release.",articles11,"['Major Lazer', 'Jillionaire', 'Major Lazer', 'Rumors']"
"This past weekend, a man named Pete Townshend took 20 tabs of LSD at a festival run by Kosmic Events. The normal dosage is typically 1-4 tabs, so yes, that is a LOT. He eventually posted a short clip of him in the act on Twitter which went viral. Ironically, his Twitter name is humantestkit.pic.twitter.com/DydbyPJcnRThe clip was eventually seen by festival owner Daniel Green, who in response had this to say.@humantestkit You will not be allowed at kosmic events in the future. This is just brutally irresponsible. We have your full legal name and pictures and if you come onto the property next year you will be arrested immediatelyBefore you jump to any conclusions or call the owner wrong for banning him, there’s more to the story. He mentions on Twitter: “He left in an ambulance and was a problem for everyone. And then he came back to try to sneak back in and we had to get him off the property.”It was a festival in a renaissance park, people wear crazy shit. Security probably didnt think anything of it, it was dark as shit. I didn’t realize he was even wearing a hospital gown until a few minutes into talking with him. It wasn’t like a dress gown, full pants and shirtClearly, if he rushes back into the event with his hospital gown, there are some issues at hand. Drug use is apparent in the dance music scene. While it is generally frowned upon by the rest of society, it has become an accepted element of rave culture if used responsibly. People need to learn how to take drugs responsibly to not only keep themselves safe but those around them.In light of the situation, Pete has apparently learned his lesson and understands the situation he put himself into.My largest regret is holding up emergency services, scaring people, and missing time with the squad and good sets.

"After a chaotic third day at The Governors Ball Music Festival, the festival founders released a statement and apology to festival attendees for what went down on Randall’s Island Park.As a result of the events, the founders hosted an AMA on Reddit Tuesday, June 4th to field questions about the events that transpired on June 2nd. The AMA beagn at 1 p.m. EST. Many questions and concerns raised from Reddit users had to do with the emergency procedures issued on the third day of the festival. On the other hand, many users complained and raised concerns about security not IDing properly and adding a minimum age requirement for future festivals. A lot of the responses from the Governors Ball team were a reiteration of the statement made before the AMA. In questions regarding the weather reports, Co-founder Tom Russell included photos of the weather reports in the morning and afternoon. “I’ve addressed this a few different places, but this AMA is pretty big so happy to address again. Take a look at the weather reports we received in the morning here: https://imgur.com/a/5sMPTgQ and also the one we received in the afternoon here: https://imgur.com/a/UrGwTJx. This was echoed by the meteorologist who we spoke to on the phone so so so many times throughout the day, and this data showed us that the best time and way to save the show was to push gates back because the likelihood for severe weather was minimal.” As for the possibility of raising the minimum age, Russell says they haven’t ruled the idea out. “Over time our audience has gotten younger, and whether that’s due to the culture, the artists, etc is debatable,” Russell said. “We have explored going 18+ and we will continue to have those discussions.” The message from the founders details the backstory of the events that occurred on Sunday, June 2. The festival includes in their statement that they talked with the professional weather service about the likelihood of thunderstorms and lightening starting early in the morning. After speaking with city departments, the festival made a decision to communicate to festival attendees that they should not come to Randall’s Island. Governors Ball staff continued to monitor the situation and called their weather service again at 11 a.m. The expected weather planned to hit between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. on June 2nd. Festival staff made the decision to push the gate openings back to 6:30 p.m. after watching the weather throughout the early afternoon. Accordingly, Music started at 7 p.m. and those in Randall’s Island Park caught a few performances. Sheck Wes, Lily Allen and Nas all graced the stage with clear weather. But a large storm hit the festival around 9 p.m. wreaking havoc on the festival grounds and its attendees.Attendees at Governors Ball to videos of the storm that hit.

"After suffering a painful yet unknown ankle journey a couple weeks ago in Las Vegas, Martin Garrix updated fans with some regretful news. Unfortunately, the jump he took from stage has put an end to many of his upcoming shows this summer. A post on his official Facebook page states “It is with deepest regrets that Martin Garrix has to announce that he is forced to cancel all his shows the coming weeks…” We saw his pain in previous videos posted to social media, but had no clue how serious the injury was. “Further examinations have determined that all his ankle ligaments are torn and surgery is needed to prevent permanent damage to his ankle.” Despite his strong will and determination to keep his schedule rolling, his health must take first priority. Garrix, notably, pushed through the pain after the accident, but his torn ankle ligaments were impossible to ignore. Looking to the future, Garrix is forced to cancel his upcoming shows “for at least the upcoming four weeks”. These events include Ultra Singapore, Echostage, Spring Awakening, and several Las Vegas stops. Obviously, it wouldn’t be possible to perform under such painful conditions. Garrix thanks everyone for their continued support and wishes to get back on his feet as soon as he can. His packed summer had just begun and fans are hoping his health will improve for the big events like Tomorrowland.

"MDMA, more commonly known as “molly”, has historically been a huge part of rave culture. With scarce sources and greed in mind, it’s not unusual that counterfeit substances are manufactured. A new, synthetic “Chinese ecstasy“-like drug is making its way from China to the rest of the world.MDMA is synthesized from the Sassafras tree oil Safrole. With high demand and popularization of the EDM scene, it is no surprise that supply cannot keep up with the demand. Scarcity of Safrole means a scarcity of “pure” MDMA, which leads to the manufacturing of fake drugs. N-Ethylnorpentylone, a designer stimulant drug, is a legal substance that hasn’t made its way to the DEA‘s Drug Scheduling. This leads to easy accessibility and evading criminal penalties. “If you think meth is strong, this is at least ten times worse.”Now, Chinese Ecstasy’s biggest threat lies in its inability to act quickly. Many users will think they did not take enough and will administer more of the drug, which can result in an overdose. Unlike most of the traditional ecstasy partygoers are familiar with, Chinese Ecstasy can keep the user up for 2-4 days. Some users have even reported to feel limp and faint. With over 125 deaths linked to Chinese Ecstasy, this drug is no child’s play. Besides N-Ethylnorpentylone, drug makers are also including harsh chemicals like boric acid, which is a drain cleaner. The best way to stay safe is to not to consume drugs; prevention is key. One user added that MDMA should show up purple when using a self-testing reagent kit. N-Ethylpentylone’s resulting colour is yellow. Below is a video of National Geographic’s “Drugs Inc.”, which provides some insights on the local “molly” market in Atlanta, GA.

"Wynn Las Vegas‘s onsite nightclub, Intrigue, recently closed its doors on Saturday, June 1st. The popular nightclub had only been around for three years, beginning its reign on the famous Vegas strip in April of 2016. Instead, the club will transform into a private event space.Intrigue hosted parties with famous DJs like Dillon Francis, RL Grime, and Diplo. The 14,000-square-foot club extended into an outdoor space as well. This place boasted its exclusivity, where social media was not allowed inside. Though Intrigue is no more, the area will still be utilized as a private event space. At least the impeccable man-made waterfall won’t go to waste. The era of Intrigue may have been short-lived but the memories made there will live on. ",articles11,['Dillon Francis']
"The clock is ticking and it’s time we say a partial goodbye to iTunes. The beloved software program Apple users have used since it was introduced in 2001 will be broken off. To clear up the confusion, Apple users will still be able to purchase music, podcast, and TV shows but it will be through separate programs. Apple held its 2019 WWDC event in San Jose, California, where they introduced iOS 13 and a revolutionary new Mac Pro. While Apple’s keynotes generally reveal new products set to be released, one announcement revealed the end of an era. iTunes will soon be replaced by Apple Music, Apple TV, and Podcasts on the new MacOS Catalina. You’re probably already accustomed to some of these already but in the next macOS, these will be your go-to apps. The Podcasts and TV applications already exists, reducing the need for iTunes. It will continue as a music store but Apple’s focus will turn to streaming inside the new Apple Music App. With streaming services like Spotify already present, Apple will need to find ways to attract users to their side. Moreover, device syncing will be moved to Finder on Mac. It is unclear what Windows users will be promoted to do. Rumors of an end to iTunes grew in the past weeks but in reality, Apple has reason for the change. Today, most users turn to music streaming rather than purchasing. In fact last year streaming produced about 75% of the music industries’ revenue. Not to worry, those that prefer to own their music going forward will still be able to within iTunes. iTunes will be missed and its impact on the music industry will not be forgotten. In a constantly changing world, it was time for a change as iTunes was beginning to feel outdated. With MacOS Catalina reported to be released later this fall, there’s still time to enjoy iTunes to the fullest. ",articles11,"['Apple’s', 'Spotify', 'Moreover', 'Today']"
"MDMA smelling perfume by the name of ‘xtacy‘ is out now. Dutch officials have launched this perfume line in hopes of something bigger than smelling like last night’s mistakes. The Netherlands is the epicenter of all things MDMA related, where the highest concentration of its pills come through. As authorities try to crack down on the behavior, it can be hard to detect its ebb and flow sometimes. That is the reason behind this interesting new fragrance. They want to spread the smell of MDMA across the country with “xtacy” so people can learn what it smells like. If they sniff out the scent among suspicious places, it could be beneficial to identifying drug factories in the neighborhood. Producing MDMA and other synthetic drugs can release toxic substances or create gases, fires, and explosions. Hazardous waste gets generated as well and can be discharged into the ocean or nature. This poses a risk to people, animals, plants, and drinking water supply. Their tagline says “Because: XTC. There is a breath of fresh air”, and quite contrary to its belief, it may just work.People should be on the look out for chemical odors being emitted in the air around vans, closed trailers near buildings, jerry cans, liquid containers, and buildings with taped windows. It takes a community to enforce change so why not start by becoming sniffer dogs? Normally it is distasteful to wake up and smell like last night’s shenanigans; however if it means to save more people in your country than your dance moves did last night, then it could surely be worth something. Check out the video below on the Dutch’s latest innovation. What are your thoughts on this fragrance? Could this be something useful in the United States as well?

"With the immense popularity of music festivals in today’s music culture today, we’re seeing massive events like Ultra Miami face environmental challenges. It’s not just the big guys, either. Other, smaller festival organizers are feeling pressure as well. The Turkish music festival PopFest 2019 has delayed their event over concerns of endangered sea turtles The event, held in Turkey’s southern province of Mersin, is pushing back its originally scheduled dates after environmentalist outcries. The festival planned to take place during the spawning period for an endangered sea turtle species known as , which is more commonly known as the Loggerhead sea turtle. This endangered species leave their eggs in 50 centimeter holes. Their incubation period lasts about 50 days. The females lay their eggs every two to three years, so this is a crucial spawning period for the species. The festival would have taken place on the beaches the turtles use. According to the Sea Turtle Conservancy, one of the greatest threats to the species survival is the threat to their nesting habitats. This is a result of coastal development and human disturbances, which can cause disorientations during the emergence of hatchlings.The concert organizer, Hüseyin Çalışkan, is sympathetic to the animals. He explained:..He’s not the only person supporting this wildlife concern, either. Turkish superstar Haluk Levent took to Twitter to share his opinions to his 1.6 million followers: Caretta caretta’lar için o bölgede yıllarca yürüyüş yaptık. Mersin idare mahkemesine başvurduk.

"Ultra Singapore is just days away but rumors are spreading that the entire event will not be happening. A text message first reported by MSNews, claims that Ultra Singapore 2019 is cancelled due to “fraudulent business practices”. As a result, all necessary building and planning of the event has supposedly halted. The event, which takes place June 8-10, would be the 6th anniversary of Ultra’s expansion to Singapore. “Ultra Singapore 2019 is cancelled as a result of years or fraudulent business practices by the owner Alex Chew.”The text message further claims that 17 lawsuits are pending against owner Alex Chew, proof to why the stage construction has come to a stop. Additional sources show stages being built but some believe it was stopped over a week ago. The text says Chew has either not paid vendors or paid them late, resulting in a boycott from the event. If the stage and festival area still looks incomplete by Friday, there could be validity to these claims. To make matters worse, many fans on social media who bought tickets for the event, claim they haven’t received access to their wristbands. An official update from Ultra Singapore states e-tickets will be sent Monday, June 3rd (Today) but we haven’t heard if anyone has received further updates. In the case of the event being cancelled, fans would expect a refund for their not so cheap ticket. Let us know if you received your e-ticket or if you’re still left empty handed. If the event were to be cancelled, vacation plans from those traveling longer distances will be ruined. Additionally, there would be questions to why ticket buyers were left in the dark, with zero updates on the event. With no response from Ultra Singapore or Alex Chew on the spreading rumors, we’ll just have to wait a couple more days to learn the fate of Ultra Singapore. We can only hope that the spreading rumors online are only rumors and that fans can enjoy this coming weekend. Stay tuned for more information regarding the event. ",articles11,[]

"In an overcrowded music world where thousands of songs are released daily, it’s easy to not “get your break.” In the chance that you do get a break, though, sometimes you’re ultimately forgotten. Today, we bring you some insight into the mind of Spencer Brown, an artist who doesn’t seem to be having either of those problems. Brown initially broke into the music world after being handpicked by Avicii as the support act on his ‘‘ tour. It’s fair to say that Brown had some big shoes to fill. After constant releases on some of dance music’s biggest labels – including Armada, & more frequently Anjunabeats – it’s easy to see that he’s done just that. Spencer Brown took to Twitter to talk about an affliction that seems to be causing a lot of turmoil in the music world these days: anxiety. In the screenshot below, you can read his thoughts on anxiety and music. He also plugs in an interview he did with one of his best friends over at Texas Monthly. Throughout the article, Spencer’s rise from a Top-40 playing, EDM-crazed, Avicii mentee is chronicled. Today, the Anjunabeats jetsetting prodigy wows crowds all over the world. There’s a point in the article in which the author speaks on how Anjuna fans seemed like a “benevolent cult” at time. If you’ve ever been to one of the Anjunabeats label parties, I’m sure you can agree. Anjuna neck tattoos, Anjuna gold chains, cape flags and all.The interview continues on to explain how Spencer saw “how fame can mangle someone who already suffers from anxiety (Avicii)”. He explains how in 2016, Avicii was “beset by the stress of being in the limelight, retired from touring at age 26.”  It must be tough seeing your mentor go through the stress. This all played a large role in the state of mind that Spencer has found himself these days.“Health has to be the first priority. You have to take care of yourself mentally and physically.”Spencer Brown states that: “Writing music is easiest when I’m anxious or distressed . . . but that year [2016] was a big wake-up call for me,”. Following that up, Spencer opened up a bit more and chose to discuss a rather tender topic, being Avicii’s suicide. He states: “When Tim passed away, it really, really affected me. Health has to be the first priority. You have to take care of yourself mentally and physically.”Spencer speaks about how DJing puts him in a “flow state”. In this state, all of his nervous energy is channeled into a mood that allows him to fixate on the crowd. In this flow state, he hyper-focuses on the mood, and pays close attention to “scanning the crowd and building the right sequence of tracks”. He focuses on “the fans’ smiles and moves when he’s auditioning his unreleased tracks, and he builds his sets around tested songs that he knows will make everyone dance.” As any good DJ can tell you, being able to connect with the crowd is key. This is what is known in DJ circles as “crowd control“.“It’s just getting the frequencies of the song that I programmed on my computer to bring love to other people,” “And along the way, it brings euphoria to me. Once you’re in that flow state, that anxiety is gone. That’s what I do this for.”Earlier in the interview, the author speaks about how he can physically see Spencer dealing with anxiety. This is because he sees the buildup of emotions he feels in the lead up to his show. With his methods, he managed to overcome these emotions and demolish the crowd at his show. Little did he know, he was later booked to open up for Anjunabeats label heads, Above & Beyond. This show was later that night to a crowd of over five thousand people at the RC Cola Plant. It goes without saying that Spencer was able to utilize his anti-anxiety methods. In doing so, he further destroyed that crowd of dance music lovers, beautifully.

While Wood portrayed his character, Norval, in hipster fashion—sported with an edgy eccentric cut and stache—the Lord of the Rings actor almost went about borrowing Skrillex’s look. According to Wood, the director Ant Timpson conveyed his original plans with a picture of Skrillex attached to the script sent to him.Over the
weekend, the film was screened and well received at the New Orleans Overlook
Film Festival. It was at that time that Wood expressed the journey behind his
costume design. “When Ant sent me the script, it came with a photo of Skrillex. No Joke. He was like, ‘This is kind of what I’m imagining.’ And I was like, Oh, f—, he must be kidding. Skrillex is fine. [But] his look is more extreme. I was like, ‘Oh s—, that is what he has in his head.’ And as we got into production, actually, his ideas got crazier. Like, Skrillex was mild in comparison. So the costume design stuff, and the hair, and all of that, that was really a collaboration. I was like, ‘He has to be human, we have to relate to him on some level. He can’t be a total alien.’”There’s no denying that Skrillex definitely has a signature look. Good call on Wood in talking the director out of that one as it would have probably turned out over the top with a fine line between flattery and mockery. co-stars Martin Donovan, Michael Smiley, and Stephen McHattie as Norval’s father.

"Imagine arriving to Black Rock City surrounded by cement barriers, dumpsters, security, and vehicle searches as you approach the gates of Burning Man. The festival awaits a major federal environmental impact statement that could restructure the festival, forever. “The future of Black Rock City is at risk, and we need your continued support” The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has published its Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) that outlines a series of operational requirements to ensure that Burning Man stays compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The BLM is concerned about the impact of the festival growing from 80,000 to 100,000 attendees. This growth poses negative environmental impact risks, according to the bureau. The concerns revolve around the Playa surface, air quality, and traffic flow. They are also concerned that a festival, this massive in size, could attract risks for a terrorism attack.Currently, the Bureau is reviewing over 2,000 public comments that will be taken into account releasing the final environmental impact statement that was released in April. Target date for this final statement to publish is June 14th, 2019, according to BLM spokesman, Rudy Evenson. The event begins Aug. 25. “We’re already moving forward with planning this year’s event with the assurance (from the BLM) that there won’t be any significant changes,” Burning Man CEO Marian Goodell told the Reno Gazette Journal last week.Burning Man officials estimate that the cost of proposed measures could reach $20 million. The annual budget of the festival is around $40 million as is. Marnee Benson, BM’s associate director of government affairs, says BLM’s requests are fueled by greed over environmental concerns. Burning Man has continued to hold a 30-year legacy since it first started on San Francisco’s Baker Beach in 1990 before moving to the Playa. A “Leave No Trace Gathering” has always been BM’s mantra. Festival attendees are diligent in knowing they must appropriately carry and dispose of their own trash. Burning Man organizers hope that the final report will reflect the grievances they and their massive following have expressed. “The BLM has to do their job,” Goodell said, “but we’re disappointed that we saw such extreme options, and the draft didn’t recognize the 30 years of work, the 30 years of history we have.”“I don’t think they’re trying to prevent us from happening. We’re an anomaly; it takes courage and perspective to want to let us flourish.” ",articles11,"['Burning Man', 'DEIS', 'Burning Man', 'Playa', 'Burning Man', 'BM’s', 'Burning Man', 'BM’s', 'Burning Man']"

"Spotify continues to pioneer the way we enjoy music. Their latest innovation allows us to rock out together even when we’re apart. An unreleased prototype called “Social Listening” lets multiple people queue up songs everyone can listen to. TechCrunch tipster Jane Manchun Wong discovered this code for the Android app. It’s only been available to Spotify employees and appears in the menu of connected devices. If a song is played near Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, the app will ask to “Connect with friends”. Scan one friend’s QR-style Spotify Social Listening code, and boom! Anyone can add songs to the real-time playlist. It is just a shared queue for now, there is no synchronized timing of listening. However, with our technology, anything is possible in the future. This feature aims to expand the music streaming service’s growth by allowing users to gain this intimate experience of co-listening. Having already differentiated itself from Apple Music, YouTube Music, and Tidal, it has been one of my go to providers for music. A help screen like the one below pops up and displays “Listen to music together. 1. On your phone, play a song and select (Connected Devices). You’ll see a code at the bottom of the screen. 2. On your friend’s phone, select the same (Connected Devices) icon, tap SCAN CODE, and point the camera at your code. 3. Now you can control the music together. You’ll see friends who are part of your Social Listening session listed in the menu. Share the URL with anyone else you want to jam with. It’s that simple! Real time sharing means real user experience, and Spotify always tries to test new products and experiences. Before, we weren’t allowed to add to someone else’s playlist, but you could follow it and listen. Now, everyone gets to be the DJ and enjoy it at the same time. Having stripped some vestigial features of its own, the music mogul is making room for an enhanced discovery through friends instead. This gives leverage over the many record label rate negotiations, where everyone in agreement will get a chance to be played. Those that do not play fair, will not.Music is an inherently social experience. It physically touches us through its vibrations. When people listen at the same time, it creates the togetherness we feel at festivals. “Social Listening” could be a way to supplement that.No further details have been released about its debut, but this is still exciting nonetheless What do you think of their latest feature?

"The stages have barely cooled off from Primavera Sound 2019 and the rumor mill is already in full swing for 2020. The popular event held annually in Barcelona just wrapped up its 2019 offering with it’s biggest bill yet. With artists like Miley Cyrus, Solange, Peach, Richie Hawtin, and Future, you could say it’s like the Coachella of Spain. Ironically, leaked images seem to indicate the festival may be making its way across the pond to California.If you’re unfamiliar, Primavera Sound is huge! Besides the diverse lineup it offers each year, it also offers a multitude of events across numerous cities and venues. A la the Winter Music Conference in Miami, the production hosts Primavera Pro each year with talks, conferences, workshops, and showcases for international music industry professionals. Additionally, Primavera Club boasts multi-venue club nights with some of the biggest up-and-coming names in the industry. If these leaked images are legit, it could mean big things are on the horizon for Los Angeles.Beyond that, the production is already spreading its influence beyond the borders of Spain. Tapping its neighbor Portugal, the festival also hosts a multi-day event in the town of Oporto under the NOS Primavera Sound heading. Since its launch in 2012, the festival has grown steadily. Furthermore, with its usual dates taking place a week after the Spain festivities, it basically creates a 2-week event in the region. Thus the Coachella comparisons.The leaked images (seen above) show two new dates added to the roster of events. If you squint and tilt your head to the side, you can make out what looks like a Hollywood sign. This totally makes sense as there is definitely a void needing to be filled since EDC left L.A. for Las Vegas. One can only hope!

"Looks like there was a lot to get hyped about at this years Movement Festival in Detroit. Last year, multiple stories circulated about a benefit show for a famous local Detroit resident known affectionately as ‘Goat Man.’ The story, which can be read here, covered the outpouring of local love for Erick Brown. At the time, Brown was in the news following an attack from a couple living in his home. As a result, the community came together to spread positive vibes in the same manner Brown is infamous for still to this day. To the delight of many, sightings of Brown and his goat are resurfacing again.Many reports of the goat sighting are eliciting shares to social media. Check out some of the many hilarious Twitter posts below:this is so fucked up lol. a festival is no place for a fucking goat what is wrong with people https://t.co/doMSxVGeTgAs you can see, not everyone particularly appreciates partying alongside our furry friends. For the most part, people were pretty hyped up to see the four-legged headbanger in the crowd:somebody brought a goat to movement. This is the greatest music festival in the world. pic.twitter.com/Hc8Kosl4CmHow does one bring a goat into movement you may ask? Well if there’s a wook, there’s a way pic.twitter.com/9FLFcKre93someone brought their goat to movement 😩 pic.twitter.com/gHE4VDQgoCBesides the fire lineup and its sets, this is a great story to hear from Movement 2019. Many Detroit area locals are well aware of Brown’s story and his goats, therefore the goat sighting isn’t bothering most. Recently, unconfirmed rumors of Brown suffering another recent unfortunate incident are making their rounds among Detroit locals. Fortunately, this didn’t seem to put a damper on the vibes at Movement Festival. While the grounds of a techno festival may not be the best place for a casual stroll with your pets, it’s nice to see the community rally around someone who’s doing their best to spread the love around. After all, that  what the rave community is all about, right? Hopefully, these types of positive vibes continue spreading as we head deeper into the festival season of 2019.",articles11,"['Brown', 'Brown', 'Brown', 'Brown’s', 'Brown']"

"Landing with a bang as the newest release on Ram Records is “Lock Stock” from Junk Mail. The drum and bass label has been supporting this weighty banger since it was first played out. And it now sees a full outing – set to fully conquer the summer. Junk Mail isn’t a newcomer in the D&B scene. Already established as one half of Mind Vortex, Stefan Anfield shows off his solo skills with a fresh alias. As a result, he is sure to have more material lined up. “Lock Stock” displays a slow burning introduction to set the scene, revving things up several notches with a piercing lead riff and raucous drum patterns. If you caught Andy C’s 2018 Rampage set there’s a real chance you will recognize this one, and we imagine it’s going to continue doing the rounds for the next couple of months. For now, hit play on “Lock Stock” and get involved. Ram Records say of the release:“It’s time to unleash this beast! Junk Mail is a new name to the roster but a familiar face to the RAM family. Stefan Anfield of Mind Vortex kicks things off with a big tune ‘Lock Stock’ that many of you heard ANDY C play out at RAMPAGE last year.”You can pick up a physical version of “Lock Stock” right away, head here to add it your drum and bass tune library. Ram is a genre leading dance music record label primarily releasing Drum & Bass music. Established in 1992 by Andy C with the help of close friend Ant Miles, the label and business today is run by Andy C and business partner Scott Bourne (Red One).Ram Records is a multi-award winning organization for its label activities, the music it releases, and the artists it has signed over the years.As well as Ram’s musical output, the label is also very well known for its legendary club nights. This all started at the infamous ‘The End’ nightclub and lasted 11 years till the clubs closure in December 2008. Moving on from The End to super-club Matter in February 2009 saw Ram’s attendees triple from 1000 to well over 3000 people within 2 months and lasted till Matters closure in June 2010. Now Ram is proud to call Fabric it’s London home. Ram has a sell-out roadblock sessions every 2 months at this institution as well as one-off events all over the world.Follow EKM.CO on:SpotifySoundcloudYoutubeFacebookTwitterInstagramLooking for music promotion?Submit Here ",articles23,"['Mind Vortex', 'Andy C’s', 'Rampage', '!

"We had a very interesting chat with Markus from the DnB powerhouse duo Indivision. We talked about his career as a producer/DJ, his record label, and more. But before getting into the interview, here’s a quick introduction to get to know them a little better:Hailing from the European capital of Estonia, the Estonian D&B duo Indivision has become a house hold name within the drum and bass scene. Pushing out their first release already almost a decade ago with ‘Secret Vision’ and ‘Rubik’s Cube’. They produced huge club smashers and dance hits that have been pushed out by some of the biggest names in the dnb scene, artists such as Grooverider, John B, High Contrast, Maduk, and Netsky (only to name only a few). With countless remixes of their work only following suit from Grafix, Chords, Ramseses B, Aperio and many others. Indivision has released over 150 tracks. The duo formulated and developed a powerful and hard hitting style that can only be described as their own staple sound, a sound that has led them to work with some of the top labels within the scene such as Toolroom, Liquicity, Beta, and Ministry of Sound.1- How did it all start for you? How did you end up producing and Djing?It was the beginning of the Pendulum era and I managed to get in some raves, it was really inspiring! And at the same time it was really popular to mess around with Fruity Loops (nowadays called FL Studio for legal reasons ). So there I was with my Pentium 4, messing around. No studio monitors or any other piece of hardware, but I managed to get tracks signed, “Femme Fatale” and “Subway 51” were the first ever released by Liquicity. 2- Who is your biggest inspiration / influence? And why?Life itself. Go for walks in nature, it is just beautiful! And the sounds! Also, definitely some TV shows, because there is a lot of music used. When it comes to artists, it is hard to pick just one, but for sure Daft Punk, The Chemical Brothers, Modjo if I have to choose some.3- What pushed you to create your own record label?I do have many unreleased tracks myself and I started to wonder some time ago: why give half of the revenue away when I know the industry and how it works. I am more than willing to give that half away if I do get decent amount of promotion and that’s what is lacking of smaller drum & bass labels. And that’s what Indivision Music offers: promo! 4- What kind of sound are you planning to release on the label? Only DnB? Or do you want to be a more open-format label?Definitely more open-format. Any electronic music genre is welcome as a matter of fact!5- What are you mainly looking for in artists for your label?Willing to work, work, work. Because a lot of work can get you far. Of course talent comes to in play as well, but talent does not come without hard work.6- What do you personally consider to be the incisive moments in your artistic career?Getting 5 vinyl releases! These are really rare these days.7- What is one mistake you see a lot of up and coming producers/DJs making? / What advice would you give to aspiring producers/Djs?What I did wrong was sending out half-finished tracks to labels. Or I have seen people changing their artist name many times As previously said, work, work work and also patience. You do develop as an artist, it takes a lot of effort though.8- Where do you think the DnB scene is headed? One year from now? Five years from now?You can’t predict really. Tracks are getting louder and louder. Take for an example a track from early 2010’s and compare it with today’s record, the latter one is so much louder. Definitely DAWs, VSTs and VSTis will improve that I can tell for sure. 9- If you could eternally be stuck in one year’s music scene, which year would it be?2010, it was magical!  10- If you could collaborate with one music producer (alive or dead), who would it be?Freddie Mercury. Incredible songwriter and vocalist!  11- What is it that you love about the DnB scene?The scene seems to be friendly with each other! Easy to make new friends! 12- What is something that bugs you about the DnB scene?I am not a fan of people who get a little bit too tipsy, but I guess it comes with every genre!13- What is your opinion regarding the difference between old school DJing where everything was restricted to vinyl and modern DJing where most tracks are never put on any physical medium before or after release?On one hand it is super comfortable to load all the fresh tracks (released or unreleased) onto a USB stick and go play out. On the other hand I reckon it is quite uncomfortable in terms of traveling and looking after your vinyl record box at a gig. As a listener I really enjoy performance by a DJ who can play vinyls and as a listener I am not so into laptop DJs! 14– What is one track that never gets old for you no matter how many times you hear/play it?Unfortunately not, I do get tired of tracks quite quick! 15- All the profits from your latest release “Difficult Times/Coals & Diamonds” are going towards helping cancer patients, why did you choose to donate your profits and why support cancer patients (of all causes)?This is personal cause for me. A year ago I lost my mother to cancer. After her passing I started to read more about cancer (her passing was really weird and fast) and I realized how many people have cancer and do not have access to treatments which could possibly cure them because they are not funded by Estonian Health Insurance Fund (similar to NHS). So, that’s why I am [and also Wreckage Machinery to be fair] giving away the revenue to a private foundation. They have helped a lot of people, my mother could have been one of them. Even if the revenue made can give a day more to live, I will be glad. Follow Indivision:Facebook.com/Indivisiondnb

"Subtronics has one of the most diverse sounds in dubstep right now. He has developed a signature sound like no one else and keeps developing it more and more with each release. Now, we have even more bass to headbang to with his newest release “Cyclops Army”.Most of the tracks on this Albums we heard in  and it's amazing to finally hear them in all their glory. The EP starts out with “Cyclops Army”, paying homage to Subtronics' fan base. With a drop that slaps you right in the face, it's an epic kick off to the EP. “Glitch Fight” is heavy hitting and will make you fall out of your seat if you're aren't prepared for the drops that are coming. “Loopholes” is just as hard and funky with bouncy bass and dialogue. “They Call Me” finishes out the EP with our final dose of wonky bass.After the release of this EP, Subtronics was added to the Electric Forest lineup, so to say I'm stoked to finally see him live is an understatement. This is just the beginning for Subtronics.",articles9,"['Subtronics', 'Subtronics', 'Subtronics', 'Subtronics']"
"CloZee encompasses some sort of magic that transports her listeners to another world.  teamed up with rising artist Lil Fish on their newest track “The Lost Voices”.The track starts out with a melodic intro and ambient voices in the background that defines CloZee's sound. The subtle drop transforms the song into the “world bass” we know and love. Downtempo beats and vocal elements that add to the magic of the track. “The Lost Voices” has the perfect combination of come ups and drops and make us eager to get out into the world and explore.Lil Fish is an up and coming artist with a sound similar to CloZee's, so we can see why this would be a perfect collaboration. Lil Fish's music embraces the same worldly vibe with an electronic twist that we can't seem to get enough of.

"If you're looking for the heaviest bass you can possibly find, look no further. After a bit of a hiatus, Snails and Krimer have come together to release a killer collab “Jackhammer”. Both Krimer and Snails are known for their earth-shattering bass and now that the two have come together, they have made something out of this world.The track starts with an epic buildup along with dialogue that follows the theme of most of Snails' music. It's dark and grimy and we couldn't love it more. The drop is full of stabbing bass that embraces the title “Jackhammer”. It's three and a half minutes of pure bass and we can't get enough.It's been six months since a  from Snails, so we hope this new track means there's more to come in the future.",articles9,[None]
"Seven Lions and Dimibo fans must be over the moon after a special announcement that was made today. We've known that Seven Lions has been working on a psytrance project for quite some time, but we didn't know that this would include another special artist.

"Porter Robinson has seen incredible success over the years through his incredibly innovating musicianship. But now he has made his way into the world of the festival circuit, as this past weekend marked the launch of his first ever original festival called Second Sky held in California. The festival featured all of Porter's favorite artists and was originally set to take place for one day. However, after the festival sold out almost immediately a second day was added with the unfortunate side effect of leaving G Jones slot empty as he had to perform elsewhere. Many speculated who would be the artist to fill the void and waiting with bated breath to find out it was no other than the infamous Skrillex.Lucky for us YouTube user, , captured the entire set. It is chock full of tracks both old and new and the energy is undeniable.

He not only released an incredible Albums but also toured just about everywhere and is continuing to do so. Porter Robinson's Second Sky Music Festival recently kicked off for the first time and I think it's safe to say that it was one amazing event. All around I've heard nothing but positive things and if you had the pleasure of attending then you were in for a treat. So many talented artists graced the stage at the festival, one of them being G Jones. I personally have never seen him live but after seeing this set from Second Sky I will be sure to catch him at his next shows, as I'm sure you will too.

This is a serious issue, and Google needs to address it.”The way that Genius Media discovered the reposts was quite clever.

"This years Gov Ball was full of great entertainment and some very unexpected surprises. The music was blasting, the sun was out (at least for the most part) and the crowd was full of electricity. It seemed like each artist from every realm of the music spectrum showed up and gave it their all. From the likes of Lil Wayne to ZHU and Florence + The Machine, every act provided some memorable performances and helped make the festival that much better. Not only was the music on high but the festival also created an environment that magnified the good vibes and spirits. Food and drink were aplenty, the stages were set up in a way that made it possible to enjoy every artist and the transportation of the festival was also on point especially in times of trouble, which I will get to later in this article. Taking place on the famous location of Randall's Island Park, the grounds were set and ready to go for all attendees to lose themselves in music. The festival was a total of 3 days, a weekend complete with everything you would encounter at a big music event and it was a time full of incredible and moving musical experiences.. —The festivities began on Friday May 31st and the weather was essentially perfect for the most part. The event started right on time and everyone arrived in their best festival gear ready to conquer the weekend. It was also fitting that it was Friday considering that everything seemed to be well in place. Not only was it gorgeous out but the lineup itself was also something to behold. There were so many amazing artists that performed and such great acts that put on some stellar shows. From the rock and roll, indie antics of Hippo Campus to the rap and bad boy personas of the group known as Brockhampton. Musically, there was really no question that Gov Ball did a great job of curating the lineup for the first day. What I think people also enjoyed most of that Friday was the fact that there were so many different artists playing from genres that you really wouldn't ever put in the same category. This diversity brought a unique and welcoming effect to the beautiful first day of the festival. There was a vibrant and energetic air on the grounds that everyone could definitely feel.  The second day of the festival was also a good one. The weather again was basically perfect, producing another great day of event shenanigans. It included acts that were world famous and renown for so many different reasons and it's no wonder that the festival put each one of them on the lineup.Some of the artists that performed were Elohim, Denzel Curry, Kacey Musgraves, Zhu and The 1975. As you can see, much like the first day of the festival, it was a lineup that was inherently diverse in nature. The day came and went with some incredible performances, most notably I think were Zhu, Gesaffelstein and Denzel Curry.Saturday also for the most part included more festival goers than that of Friday. There were so many different and interesting people who came to see the show. Although this was the case, moving about the festival was relatively easy for the most part. The stages rocked and they were set up in a way that made everyone feel like they weren't missing anything from the artist that they wanted to see. Food and drink were again on point and it is no surprise that the second day of the festival brought everyone to their happy place once again.
Courtesy of Sacha Lecca of Rolling StoneThe last and final day of Gov Ball NYC was interesting to say the least… Not only was there an unexpected lineup change, which meant that the doors didn't open until later in the day at 6:30, but there was also an unexpected cancellation of the festival once the sky actually opened up and the rain came pouring down. It was a day that seemed the opposite of what we experienced on Friday and Saturday. The weather was just flat out not good and was at some point pretty unsafe. We did get to see some performances though despite the cancellation of the event, some of those artists included Nas, Bob Moses, Sheck Wes and Bazzi. Each one of the made the best of a bad situation and some even had to cut their set in half. Despite all that though, they did not disappoint and still were able to give the brave festival goers of Sunday a show. My heart also goes out to the acts that did not get to perform that day because of the weather. I'm sure there were a lot of fans disappointed and it was a shame that they didn't get to play. Nevertheless, I think Gov Ball did a fine job handling the situation. The first and foremost priority of any festival is to keep its attendees safe and Gov Ball made sure of that. When things got bad they gave their best efforts to ensure that everyone got out quickly, knowing that the weather was going to get worse and worse. Even though there were definitely some stragglers and people who did not intend on leaving. Eventually the crowd dissipated and the island was empty, which ended yet another crazy weekend of musical enjoyment that a lot of fans will probably never forget.  
Courtesy of Griffin Lotz of Rolling Stone—Gov Ball 2019 was an event unlike any other, it provided everything needed for the avid festival goer and I, as I'm sure all of you, cannot wait for the next one in 2020. Although it wasn't the smoothest of weekends, in the end the festival lived up to its name and gave the people what they wanted. Thanks to Gov Ball for having me and I hope you all enjoyed the festival as much as I did!

"This weekend, thousands of fans were disappointed to find out that Swedish House Mafia had a last minute cancelation from Ultra Korea. The cancelation was mysterious in nature, and the guys nor representatives have shed any light on the development. While many of us are scratching our heads wondering what could have caused this hiccup, DJ Germany has reported a potential bombshell piece of information if their sources prove to be reliable.Supposedly, sources close to Swedish House Mafia say that the guys are in the process of signing, or have already signed a major deal with Live Nation to help bring them stateside for a stadium tour. Unfortunately, the specifics of this deal mean that the trio can no longer perform at festivals which do not directly benefit Live Nation. This means that all of their scheduled festival performances would ultimately be canceled. It is important to remember that this is still unconfirmed. You can read the full story via .

Amid a plague of obvious danger signs, the fest shows no sign of stopping. Originally scheduled to take place at Watkins Glen on August 16-18, the festival now no longer has a venue.Watkins Glen has now officially cancelled the event on their grounds. Almost immediately after that CID Entertainment, the company behind logistics such as camping and transport has also pulled out. While a clear reason has not been shared – it is obvious that the event organizers have had a bad run at planning the festival and it is leading them to the mess they are in now. About a month ago, after the event was originally deemed as cancelled by the event's investors – the organizers went to court to make a statement that nothing was in fact cancelled and that they would be pulling through by hell our high water.Gregory Peck, a managing member of the woodstock organizers has just put out a statement:“We are in discussions with another venue to host Woodstock 50 on August 16 and look forward to sharing the new location when tickets go on sale in the coming weeks”While this may be true – with less than 2 months to go and no venue – things are looking grim.",articles9,['Watkins Glen']
"With Porter Robinson about to embark on his debut festival held in Oakland, California – he is pulling out all the stops when it comes to creating a one of a kind experience. Held on June 15th & 16th, the festival will feature 10 featured musicians, a variety of vendors and a wide array of food and drink at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park. The artists include: Chrome Sparks, Cashmere Cat, Anamanaguchi, Kero Kero Bonito, Madeon, G Jones, Wednesday Campanella, and Nina Las Vegas. However, the most surprising element is that Porter will be both opening and closing his own festival.According to his post on Twitter, he plans to open up the festival as Virtual Self to get people to arrive early and see all of the other artists. It's an unheard of move that is sure to help spread the love to his carefully curated cohorts and it is a shining example of his genuine nature. By closing out the festival as Porter Robinson it will likely ensure peak attendance through the duration of the event. Will this be a trend we see replicated in the future?the idea behind having Virtual Self open Second Sky is to encourage people to arrive early & watch all the other acts that i love! — porter robinson (@porterrobinson) ",articles9,"['Porter Robinson', 'California –', 'Madeon', 'G Jones', 'Porter Robinson']"
"It has been reported that a helicopter crash has taken place at the Backwoods Music Festival killing 3 people and injuring 1 – cutting the festival short early.The Robinson R44 helicopter was carrying four passengers who were sightseeing and festival staff became panicked when the pilot didn't show up well after his return time of 7 PM. While there was conflicting information initially, it was later reported and confirmed the helicopter was downed – though the reason is yet to be determined. The Tulsa Helicopter Tours were offered as festival attractions for attendees – but after the copter was discovered at 8 PM the festival was stopped and an announcement was made over the festival's PA system. All attendees were told that rescue efforts were under way and that depending on the outcome the show might go on. Sadly, it did not.“Today, our hearts rest with our three team members, friends, and family of ours, who passed yesterday,” stated the Backwoods team on a recent Facebook post. “We thank you for understanding that we were unable to run the stages with lights and lasers during the air rescue which ensued late into the night, or sound due to radio interference.

"Major Lazer is notoriously known for elevating the popularity of dancehall rhythms across the globe. Made up of Diplo, Walshy Fire, and until this week, Jillionaire, the group have spread peace and love through music from Miami, to Brazil, to Cuba and Japan – finding a diehard fanbase wherever they go. With over 6 smash singles and collaborations with everyone from Justin Bieber to Nicki Minaj to J Balvin and Travis Scott – the group has grown to a household name.But now, the group is changing forms. Christopher Leacock, popularly know as Jillionaire is departing the group to focus on his own projects. Stepping in to fill the void comes Ape Drums, the American DJ known for fusing electronic music with Caribbean sounds. This seems to mark a larger shift for the group as there have been rumblings that they may disband all together following what is presumed to be their last Albums titled . If one thing is true about music and art, it is that change is inevitable and it will know doubt be interesting to see how Major Lazer evolves (or devolves from here).The group just closed out their first show with Ape Drums and it was nothing short of incredible – boding well for the future of Major Lazer, at least for now.https://twitter.com/MAJORLAZER/status/1131966987209281539Feels good to be back.

"Anton Zaslavski, otherwise known as Zedd, has become a household name the world over through his smash-hit successes “Clarity,” “Stay the Night,” and “Break Free.” But it is turning out that the Grammy award-winning producer may not be who he is cracked up to be. Matthew Koma, the American singer-songwriter who wrote “Clarity,” and “Spectrum,” has just put Zedd on blast in a series of tweets posted less than 24 hours ago.He cites that Zedd is “so toxic and self-serving that he couldn't even occupy a space where happiness exists.” He stated that Zedd didn't give Koma proper credit and that he gave interviews and carried himself as having created these Songs almost in their entirety without Koma's help. Koma also says that it took him years to receive any payment for the “Clarity” and “Spectrum.” The ultimate nail in the coffin is that it sounds as though Zedd isn't nearly as prolific as his classical-musician persona makes it seem – in one instance of them working together Koma suggested they change the key of a song but Zedd refused as it seemed he couldn't play piano in anything other than the key of C.All in all these are quite the allegations and call a lot into question regarding the DJ/Producer that so many people idolize. As Koma mentions, “Ego, success, it's all happened and been told before, especially in the context of music.” What do you think? Is Zedd really all who he seems?See the tweets below:Dear Zedd part 1: — Matthew Koma (@MatthewKoma) Dear Zedd Part 2: — Matthew Koma (@MatthewKoma)   ",articles9,"['Anton Zaslavski', 'Zedd', 'Zedd', 'Zedd', 'Zedd', 'Koma', 'Koma', 'Zedd', 'Zedd', 'Matthew Koma', 'Matthew Koma']"

"REZZ revealed at the beginning of June that she would be  with rock band Underoath called “Falling”. Now, the time has finally come and we have not only the single, but a Music Videos for the track as well.The track perfectly combines Rezz's signature synths with Underoath's vocals and rock sound. Not so surprisingly, the two sound great together. The two blend together seamlessly intro an EDM-rock track we didn't know we needed.The music video features Underoath's lead singer Aaron Gillespie strapped to a chair wearing a VR headset. Inside the virtual reality, we see Gillespie trying to escape a room he is trapped in inside of the VR. “The concept we landed on is essentially about using VR as a metaphor for being trapped in your own negative, depressive, or anxious thoughts, which can ultimately be self-destructive,” says video director Colin G Cooper.“Working with Rezz has been such a shock to my system in every way,” says Aaron Gillespie. “I never expected to be part of the electronic music world, and I never expected to like it as much as I do. Rezz’s talent speaks for itself. This song is so cathartic. I’m so stoked for everyone to hear it.”",articles9,"['Underoath', 'Underoath', 'Underoath', 'Aaron Gillespie', 'I’m']"

"Just in time for (western hemisphere) beach season: guitarist and all-around chill guy Mike Cooper has announced a 15th anniversary reissue of his album  via Room40. Recorded in 2004 in Palombara, 40 minutes outside of Rome, Rayon Hula is part Pacific, part hauntological. It’s the sort of music the guitarist wished he heard when he visited the Pacific Island Nations in the 90s. The sounds of steel guitars lazily float in the middle of hazy clouds of reverb. Unattached to any time period, the record exists as a sort of faux-nostalgia.“After several trips, beginning in 1994, to Australia and subsequently to South East Asia and then to the Pacific and its Island Nations, I conceived the idea of making an updated more ‘now’ version of some of the Exotica music that originated in the 1950s in America,” says Cooper. “Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny were the two I mostly had in mind at the time, but I didn’t want it to sound like them and the two words ‘Ambient’ and ‘Electronic’ had to figure large. I was deeply influenced by the ambiance of the places I was visiting (Australian birds are scarily creative) and lo-fi electronics were something I had been working with in my free improvisation gigs since the 80s.”“Kiribati is a Pacific Island Nation and was one of the last places to be settled by humans and will be one of the first to disappear as the waters rise due to Global Warming,” he continues. “Is music political that has no lyrics? I would like to think so.” The music contained on the album was also “heavily influenced” by reading James Hamilton Patterson’s books  and . “The planet is seven-tenths water,” Cooper reminds us.You can pre-order a copy of  on digital or (limed-edition, transparent red) LP via  ahead of its July 19 release. In the mean time, kick off your shoes and watch the video of “Paumalu (Sunset Beach)” down below for a politically righteous-yet-relaxing taste of the exotica to come. 15th Anniversary tracklisting:01.

"Musical dread and melancholy are pretty easy to come by if you are actively listening for it; but I’m trying to think of a sound that’s comparable to The Body’s take on those particular meta-tones, and the only thing that readily comes to mind is…that new iPhone commercial with the lady at the hairdresser laughing incessantly. The audio doesn’t really compare, of course, but the ad itself manages to inspire that same terrible feeling of hopelessness that can only be resolved by Slip N’ Slide during summer time. (It’s impossible to retain a frown on a thoroughly lubricated trip down one of those things!) Can the Slip N’ Slide bring joy to YOUR life, even if you’re inclined to commiserate with The Body’s  or  from last year, though?Only one way to find out: check out Lee Buford and Chip King’s full anatomical presence when they go on tour beginning in July.

"“The sleeping body may lie under the stars, and the dreamer may dream of the stars—even of a journey to the stars—but the night of the dream is a night without stars.”—Maurice BlanchotLawrence English’s superb Room40 imprint is about to unveil a vast, post-classical concept album from Iranian sound artist Siavash Amini.  is scheduled for an August 2 release, and will be Amini’s first work for the Australian label. The album’s genesis has its roots in the idea of “the other night,” as explored by French philosopher Maurice Blanchot: a night spent in dreams rather than sleep. Prompted by a spell of nocturnal sleeplessness and intoxication, Amini zeroes in on the concept of : the sensation of floating in a half-sleep state where familiar objects and people take on new, uncanny qualities. To that effect, he again employs a viscous mix of orchestral instrumentation and harsh ambient noise. Earlier in June, Amini’s equally tenebrous collaboration with fellow Iranians (by way of Paris) 9T Antiope, , was released. That album can be purchased .

" We’ve heard the adage many times, but it seems to hold less and less true as the megapixels in our phones increase. A natural vista looks not as majestic with the Walden filter thrown on top of it. The sharp clarity of video, with its inevitable shakiness, can do nothing but compound the issue. So when a video travelogue emerges that exhibits even a whisper of what it must have felt like to be there, well, we should all take notice.Miss Red’s new track “Prayers” is a stellar candidate of the above pontificating. The final number from the forthcoming  (produced by The Bug) is a departure for the singer, a spooky ambient break from her usually confrontational songs. The grainy, hair-streaked video complements the wispy ephemera of the track, a nostalgic look back at Red’s travels across the globe.

"Seaketa is an enigmatic music and video artist from Kyoto, who we know next to nothing about. Favorite color? Coke versus Pepsi? Is a hot dog a sandwich? We have no clue where they stand.

Today, TMT has the pleasure of premiering  in its entirety, all six glitchy and warped tracks of it.As a thesis, Seaketa set out to make music that translates experience into sound without the mediation of a tangible language. The result is something at once both familiar and odd, ear-wormy and discordant. Sound collages of jazz, pop, and video game soundtrack stylings that show the unexpected forms each can take. To describe the album in terms that fit its spirit (which is both so simple and so completely confusing):  sounds like the internal monologue of a Sega Genesis cartridge as it grapples with its own existence.Decode that description by streaming  in its entirety down below.

"Good news, fellow cogs-in-the-machine:  is the next album from Benjamin Power (a.k.a. Blanck Mass), and all signs point to it being an intense and occasionally growling response to any number of disconcerting events currently happening on a personal and global scale. First, the final season of  was a tragic and monumental demonstration of how television writers are consistently mooching off of talented authors with a penchant for train conductor hats (although that’s a gripe that Power himself may or may not have). And , Power composed the new release as personal loss and an international plague of “blood-sucking” consumerism intervened in his thought process at varying stages during the recording. As official press puts it: “these eight tracks are the diary of a year of work steeped in honing craft, self-discovery, and grief…”As you may recall, Blanck Mass’ preceding album  also arrived as a partial reaction to political turmoil, both at home in the UK and internationally, and that album was his first solo effort to be mostly recorded in a dedicated studio just outside Edinburgh.  was also recorded there, and the track “House vs. House” suggests a continuation of the forceful beat + vocal sample combination that’s gradually being perfected here.You can pre-order the new album ahead of its August 16 release date, .

"It’s time for the age-old question: how do sound designers feel about putting water instead of milk on cereal? Also, how do sound designers fare on a musical level when they’re removed from a project that they’re tasked to complement?

"If  demonstrated an emotional evolution on the part of now Los Angeles-based musician Melina Duterte (a.k.a. Jay Som), then her new album …well, it  that emotional evolution. The release of  on August 23 (courtesy of Polyvinyl) takes place subsequent to a 2017 move to Los Angeles from Duterte’s birthplace in the Bay Area, and just like her last album conveyed a newfound contentedness with where her musical career was taking her, she now seems increasingly cool with the increasing attention that she’s gotten as a result of her introspective, bedroom pop songs. She still insists on humility and the unavoidability of mistakes, however. (Keyboards simply  keep the  button!)But even though  continues that tradition of Jay Som assuming the production/engineering duties entirely by herself, it’s also her first release where she seriously welcomed contributions from outside musicians; including Laetitia Tamko (Vagabon), Annie Truscott (Chastity Belt), Taylor Vick (Boy Scouts), and Justus Proffit. “Superbike,” the first single from the release, certainly suggests a continued casualness of overall musical style, and arguably a persistence of not-so-secret shoegaze appreciation, but Duterte’s stated desire for “more [grooviness]” seems to come through as well. “Anak ko” means “my child” in Tagalog, by the way.

Personally, I think it’s relatively difficult to discern a London impression (Okzharp is currently based in London), but  insist that it’s there. Maybe in the synth that swells periodically. Probably  in the tribal chanting.Pre-order  . EP tracklisting:01. Now What

"The Pre-Raphaelites were the old heads of Victorian England’s art scene, rejecting the corny symmetry and pretension still left over from Renaissance painting for the Medieval era’s well-lit, colorful scenes and embrace of physical imperfection. Throughout the 1840s and 50s, the group drew the ire of the artistic establishment, espoused the virtues of rawness, printed a short-lived and unpopular zine (unfortunately titled ), and pined for imaginary red-haired girls.It’s not a stretch to compare this band of iconoclasts to the cassette culture that cropped up in the 90s — especially when Japanese singer-songwriter  is the one dubbing the tapes. Circa 2009, she stumbled on an 1893 edition of , an illustrated collection of nursery rhymes by pre-Raphaelite poet and proto-feminist Christina G. Rossetti. Taken by the book’s charm and lyrical style, Kato decided to record an album’s worth of music accompanying Rossetti’s verse, tinged with tape hiss and ramshackle orchestration. “A ring on her finger,” which serves as a sort of DIY wedding march, is the second single from Kato’s upcoming  LP — a follow-up and spiritual successor to 2015’s . An overgrowth of strummy guitar and casio tones, it’s equally indebted to Beat Happening and Judy Collins. Rossetti’s verse is recited as if it’s being read from a hymnal; understated enough to blend seamlessly into the sylvan warmth: drops June 26 (July 6 internationally) via Tokyo-based label flau.

"Hey, did you know  still exists? Maybe the demand was high for a  of “Wrecking Ball” that still seems to have a bajillion choruses; but for most artists, the ability to showcase their acoustic (or at least stylistically different) work usually comes without the fanfare of a headlining event sponsored by a formerly great media conglomerate. Chelsea Wolfe released  back in 2013, which was a year or two after the Northern Californian started receiving serious praise for her not-really-acoustic work in favor of the brand new, sure-to-catch-on “doom folk” sub-genre! The album was a collection of previously written songs that hadn’t previously made their way on to a tracklisting, and it was super interesting to hear Wolfe’s music in a context that arguably invited even more intimacy. Hey…how  some MORE?Well actually, other the fact that they’re both mostly acoustic releases,  and the forthcoming  share little in common; the former was an unplugged odds-and-ends, while the latter was recorded at Wolfe’s home in the California wilderness, where only a couple of bodies were invited to contribute at a production or instrumental level. In other words, she had the mindset of genuine solo artist as she was writing each track from the outset, resulting in something more deliberate and mountainous.Check a trailer and the track “The Mother Road” below and  to see a listing of summer/fall acoustic tour dates.

"“For the love of dance music, we come together in nature”, was the motto and the reason for leaving the city life in New York and venturing 2 hours upstate to Monticello during Memorial Day Weekend. Since 2014, Teksupport has brought new life to New York City’s nightlife by bringing incredible talent from all over the world to large scale underground dance events in Brooklyn. To celebrate their 5 year anniversary, Teksupport has thrown the inaugural edition of their first festival, Gather Outdoors. Thoughts on how a massive techno event would be executed in the small town of Monticello definitely grew some speculation among attendees. The festival took place on Holiday Mountain for two days and offered a wide array of accommodation options from onsite regular camping, glamping, RV, and off-site hotel options which was the route I took. The idyllic forested location served as the backdrop to Gather’s first year which featured 4 stages and showcased sounds from some of the industry’s most innovative selectors. With weather predictions forecasting scattered showers both Saturday and Sunday, booking a hotel that was an 8 minute drive from the festival seemed like the best idea. Ubers and Lyfts were very limited however, after two 30 minutes wait times and cancellations, we booked a taxi to and from the festival for the next day as well. Concerns were apparent for campers who felt the disorganization and lack of transparency about the shuttle times as well as confusion around the details of when camping would start. The camping section was a stone throw away from the Hemlock Stage (stage 1). Not closing out the camping area made for a really open, inclusive, and festive environment and truly “gathered” everyone.Day 1 saw performances from David Berrie, Marco Faraone, Butch, Matador, Floorplan, Francesca Lombardo, Victor Calderone, Paco Osuna and a very special 4 hour set from the Desert Hearts Crew. Day 2 brought out Agoria, Doc Martin, MK, Mr. G, Danny Tenaglia, Maya Jane Coles, Art Department, Stacey Pullen, Fjaak, Jamie XX, and Amelie Lens.The stages were carefully spread out amongst the venue and were conveniently located if you were at the bottom of the mountain and came to see the artists only playing at the first two stages, Hemlock and Beech. Both stages were a 2 minute walk apart yet did not experience any noise bleeding from either. Stage 3 was a mission to get to as it was located at the top of the mountain on a very steep incline. The chair lift was operating during the earlier sets but was turned off at around 10pm so if there was an artist playing at the Oak-Members stage you had to decide whether to commit and start the trek. As it rained, the slope became a mudslide and we saw some people take a tumble.The sound system was incredible, the views were refreshing, and the vibe was eclectic. Aside from the few hiccups that are common for a first year festival, Gather Outdoors was an absolute hit. Once we got over the hurdles, it was nothing but the best vibes with the friendliest people. I have seen most of the names on the lineup in a packed, sold out setting in Brooklyn and it was almost hard to believe that I saw big time heavy hitters like MK with a crowd of 50 people and techno titan Amelie Lens in a crowd of 70 people. Picture the same exact electric Brooklyn vibe but with all of the space in the world to just DANCE. People walked in and out of camping with solo cups and made it feel like a backyard party with your closest friends rather than being at a festival. I don’t know if I’ll ever have that opportunity again.I commend Teksupport for their hard work and dedication that definitely did not go unnoticed. Just a week after the festival, they announced their return for 2020 and I cannot wait to be back.

Below, hear the new tracks “Starcourt” and “The Ceiling Is Beautiful.”“With the Season 3 soundtrack, we’ve made an album that doesn’t feel like a ‘score’ necessarily, but one that feels more like a stand-alone record than a collection of brief cues,” Dixon and Stein said in a statement. “We’ve incorporated the main narrative elements of the series and stayed true to the original sound while at the same time expanding on our musical palette—we often pushed it to the limit. We’ve really made an effort to curate this album to showcase the moments we think are really special.”The third season of “Stranger Things” hits Netflix on July 4. The next day, Legacy Recordings releases the compilation Stranger Things: Soundtrack From the Netflix Original Series, Season 3. It features songs by Patsy Cline, “Weird Al” Yankovic, REO Speedwagon, John Mellencamp, and more.Read “Inside the Spellbinding Sound of ‘Stranger Things’” on the Pitch.:01 Boys and Girls

"When Philippe Zdar tragically passed away last night, at the age of 52, the disco-kissed French touch style of house music that flourished in Parisian nightclubs in the 1990s lost one of its chief architects and most talented craftsmen. Born Philippe Cerboneschi, the son of a hotelier in the French Alps, Zdar got his start in the music business on its very lowest rung, as a “tea boy” at Paris’ Studio Marcadet, where he was kept around, he once said, because he made good jokes and rolled good joints. His first year at the studio, Prince, Bryan Ferry, and Sade all recorded there. “It took me a while to begin to understand stuff, and I still don’t mind if I don’t know what all the gear does,” he said last year. “I’m happy to work as a craftsman who learned enough about the technical side to make what he wants.”What distinguished Zdar’s music—both in his own groups and as a Grammy-winning producer of artists including Phoenix and Cat Power—was that unusually tactile quality. In the early ’90s, at the same time that Daft Punk were channeling Chicago’s raw, machinic house music into a fresh, filter-swept sound, Zdar’s groups La Funk Mob (with Boom Bass, aka Hubert Blanc-Francard, the son of Zdar’s first studio boss) and Motorbass (with Etienne de Crécy) invented their very own strain of loopy, funk-infused downbeat and house. Then, at the turn of the millennium, Zdar reunited with Blanc-Francard to form Cassius, who would perfect that gossamer, unmistakably French sound and tilt it toward pop.Over the years, Zdar translated his innate curiosity, attention to detail, technical acumen, and boundless intuition into one of the most sought-out signatures in contemporary music, working with everyone from Beastie Boys to the Rapture to Franz Ferdinand. (Most recently, he contributed to Hot Chip’s new album, .) On some records he’s credited as a mixer, on others as a producer, but Zdar’s collaborators tended to describe his role in more nebulous terms, as a sort of alchemist, or midwife. This seemed to suit him. “There are a few things in your body that you don’t control, like swallowing, sweating, your heartbeat,” he told  in 2012, “this is exactly how it feels for me producing. People call it ‘producing,’ I call it ‘helping’—it’s the same. It’s totally natural.”More than anything, in an industry characterized by its implacable egos and platinum-card swagger, Zdar was known for his humility. He was proud of the fact that he had poured his DJ earnings into building his Motorbass studio into a shrine to analog craft; he spent months in Ibiza every year—not to party but to spend time on a rural ranch. “I would also hope that the artists I work with are good people,” he said. “To me, that’s more important than talent. If someone is an asshole, I’m not interested in going into the studio with them, even if their music is incredible. The way I spend my time nowadays is what matters the most to me.”Here are nine of Zdar’s most definitive productions.Zdar was still starting out when French rapper MC Solaar came calling, looking for someone to record his debut single. Hubert Blanc-Francard supplied the beats; Zdar mixed and engineered, using a Fairchild compressor—a favorite of the Beatles—to put an idiosyncratic twist on the music, a world away from the rougher sound of American boom-bap. That sound would become a trademark of French rap. Daft Punk’s Thomas Bangalter would later credit Zdar’s compression as an influence on Daft Punk’s own style.La Funk Mob’s records on Mo Wax represented an early win for French dance music, at a time that UK clubbers weren’t much interested in what was happening among their Gallic neighbors. Impressed with Blanc-Francard’s beats for MC Solaar, M0 Wax label chief James Lavelle asked for more instrumentals in a similar vein, but not two- and three-minute cuts: He wanted longer excursions befitting the trip-hop label’s heady, psychedelic sound. Blanc-Francard reached out to Zdar, and the two endeavored to try making tracks similar to what Zdar was doing with Motorbass—sleek, sculpted grooves, just one or two sampled loops polished like marble—but with the four-to-the-floor pulse replaced by broken beats. They also put their hands to drowsier, more downbeat cuts, like the unforgettably titled “Ravers Suck Our Sound and Get Fuck,” while remixes from Carl Craig and Richie Hawtin carried their tunes into clubbier territory.It was with Etienne de Crécy that Zdar notched his first—and, to real house music heads, his most enduring—classic album. Where the duo’s two 1993 EPs are rougher, more exploratory affairs,  is less rowdy, more heads-down, driven by powerful, swollen bass frequencies that are more felt than heard. As opposed to the silky approach Daft Punk were taking at the time, Zdar’s mixing dove directly into the goo, stirring up his sounds until they were as thick and disorienting as trucker coffee.The Source label was a key outlet for French electronic music in the ’90s, and its 1995 compilation  gave many listeners their first taste of artists like Air, DJ Cam, Alex Gopher, and DJ Gilb-R. Zdar’s productions turns up four times on that album. It fell to La Funk Mob’s “Slimfasst” to kick the whole thing off: an unorthodox take on drum’n’bass that proved exactly how freaky French electronic music could get.Most people remember Étienne de Crécy’s  compilation for de Crécy’s own “Prix Choc,” an easygoing jazzy house track with the looped refrain of “Sensemillia/Marijuana” spoken in Jamaican patois over the top. But Zdar also teamed up with de Crécy under the one-off alias La Chatte Rouge for a string- and trumpet-laden downtempo track that’s as opulent as the furniture at Versailles.Cassius’  marked the end of an era. Awash in sumptuous funk and soul samples, buffed to a deep gleam, and less interested in pop music’s quick-hit dopamine bursts the dancefloor’s hypnotic slow burn,  is really the last great example of the French touch. The ebullient Gwen McCrae-sampling single “Feeling for You” laid the groundwork for a strain of disco-sampling anthem that would yield results as different as DJ Koze’s “Pick Up” and Avicii’s “Levels.”In 2000, Zdar worked with then-newcomers Phoenix to mix their debut album, . Guitarist Laurent Brancowitz credited him for rescuing the record from abject failure: “Philippe came and he saved the album; he was a Christ-like figure, we were doomed and he saved us.” It’s not hard to hear Zdar’s touch on songs like “Too Young” and “If I Ever Feel Better,” which sparkle with an impossible-to-define sense of presence. That sense is heightened on 2009’s , where Brancowitz deemed Zdar’s role as more akin to “creative advisor.” The vividness with which he renders every sound, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant, elevates the album, highlighting the band’s quirks and brokering an oft-attempted, seldom-accomplished alliance between indie rock and disco. It’s a joyful, guileless sound—a celebration of balance and proportion, an invitation to immerse yourself in a studio-constructed illusion.There was a time when it  would have been unthinkable to say Cat Power’s and Philippe Zdar’s names in the same breath. Then he produced , her ninth album. Chan Marshall’s best work has always been mostly sinew and bone, wrapping her voice around simple, declarative chord changes, and Zdar honors that formula while blowing it up into four dimensions. Multi-tracking, synthesizers, the odd breakbeat or drum machine, and once, even, the almost-hokey sample of an eagle’s cry—he brings it all in, subtly polishing her sound without ever losing sight of its essence.It is the very worst kind of irony that Cassius’ , the follow-up to their 2016 album , is out tomorrow. (Zdar was also billed to play Central Park’s Summerstage this Sunday.) A handful of singles from the album have appeared in the past few months, and the most recent, “Calliope,” is among the best things the duo has done in years. A world away from ’s more over-the-top inclinations, “Calliope” looks back to classic ’90s techno without ever feeling like an overt throwback. The song starts minimally with gaseous, dub-techno chords, but once the beat kicks in, the tune swiftly converts itself a kind of eyes-closed, deeply ecstatic deep house, the kind of thing that would sound sublime at sunrise—whether on an outdoor dancefloor surrounded by a thousand loved-up ravers or sitting on the patio of a rural Ibizan finca, far from the madding crowd. Like all of Zdar’s best work, it’s a song that creates its own world.",articles4,"['Prince', 'La Funk Mob', 'Blanc-Francard', 'Cassius', 'Beastie Boys', 'Hot Chip’s', 'Ibiza', 'MC Solaar', 'Thomas Bangalter', 'Zdar’s', 'Gallic', 'Blanc-Francard’s', 'MC Solaar', 'James Lavelle', 'Richie Hawtin', 'Air', 'DJ Cam', 'Alex Gopher', 'La Funk Mob’s', 'La Chatte Rouge', 'Versailles', 'Gwen McCrae', 'DJ Koze’s', 'Philippe Zdar', 'Central Park']"

"Up until this month, King Crimson were among the final streaming-service holdouts from the classic rock era. And it made sense. Robert Fripp has famously stated that his pioneering prog outfit isn’t simply a band but also a “way of doing things.” Often, that way of doing things involves resisting the obvious path—sometimes at the expense of the band’s stability. The past 50 years of Crimson have been defined by restlessness, thanks to an ever-changing lineup and a sound that’s always searching (typically in odd tunings and time signatures). In one song, they’re a gnarly rock trio with tritone riffs; in another, they’re a gorgeous folk outfit with flutes and fantastical lyrics. Combine that tendency with their myriad spin-off projects (referred to as ProjeKcts), collaborative releases, and absurdly elaborate box sets, and you have one of the more intimidating bodies of work in rock history. But now that the majority of their catalog has finally arrived on Spotify, Apple Music, and more, it’s never been easier to join the Court of King Crimson. Start with these six albums, and explore the rest at your own pace.King Crimson’s debut album presents their most recognizable face. It’s there on the cover—the iconic painting by Bary Godber—but it’s also in the restless, symphonic music. Songs like “21st Century Schizoid Man” and “The Court of the Crimson King” have lost none of their paranoid energy, and ballads like “I Talk to the Wind” and “Moonchild” remain among their most memorable deep cuts. The defining sounds of the record—Ian McDonald’s Mellotron and the passionate vocals of Greg Lake—would soon be phased out, as Fripp began experimenting more. But it would take years for the rest of the world to catch up to the vision of .Stream it on: Spotify, Apple MusicIf you like this, consider listening to: King Crimson’s 1970 follow-up, . It essentially recreates the formula of this album, to varying degrees of success.The title is fitting: These jazzy, string-accompanied tracks are somewhat disconnected from King Crimson’s larger body of work, but they’re worth a visit. Their final album to feature the lyrics of Peter Sinfield,  is a transitional work, showing a band on the way to a tighter, bolder sound. While this exercise in jazz fusion was a brief phase, it was also an essential one. The album’s gorgeous story-songs, like the title track, and psychedelic saxophone parts courtesy of Mel Collins show the band at its most escapist. A minor work for King Crimson,  would have been the highlight of many other acts’ discographies.Stream it on: Spotify, Apple MusicIf you like this, consider listening to: the Sailors Tales box set, from 2017. It collects every existing live show from this era, building a completist shrine out of what may have seemed like a curio.This marked the beginning of King Crimson’s most consistent lineup of the ’70s. With the assistance of bassist/vocalist John Wetton and virtuosic drummer Bill Bruford, along with violinist David Cross and percussionist Jamie Muir, Fripp was able to conjure a deeper, darker sound.  spans relatively straightforward highlights like “Easy Money,” to classical-influenced set pieces like the two-part title track. With it came a period of King Crimson’s career in which composition and live improvisation shared equal billing. Essentially,  is the sound of a band figuring out how to incorporate the chaos around them into the songs themselves.Stream it on: Spotify, Apple MusicIf you like this, consider listening to: the live recordings from this era. They are just as essential and there’s no shortage of them to choose from. From the half-live follow-up album  to massive box sets like , you can hear King Crimson evolving with every performance.For an act often defined by its uncontainable adventurousness,  is a window into the sleeker side of King Crimson. At this point, the band was essentially a trio—Robert Fripp on guitar, Bill Bruford on drums, and John Wetton on bass and vocals—and its songs were newly direct, both musically and lyrically. The title track is an instrumental proto-metal megalith, and the imagistic ballad “Starless”—though 12 minutes long—aims straight for the heart, with Wetton’s poignant vocal delivery and Fripp's slow-building guitar solo. While most Crimson albums are notable for signalling rebirths,  is alone in feeling like a grand finale: the gripping conclusion to a half-decade of work, with not a note wasted. It’s one of King Crimson’s undeniable masterpieces.Stream it on: Spotify, Apple MusicIf you like this, consider listening to: Fripp’s work outside of Crimson. From his collaborative ambient masterpieces with Brian Eno (1973’s () and 1975’s ), to the daring art-pop album he produced for Daryl Hall (1980’s ), Fripp’s ambition kept him busy outside of the prog world he inspired.After a seven-year hiatus during the second half of the ’70s, King Crimson marked their return with a new lineup, a new sound, and, if Fripp had had his way, a new name. Discipline was slated to be the moniker for this endeavor, featuring new recruits Adrian Belew on guitar and vocals and Tony Levin on bass and Chapman Stick. But after an early rehearsal, it became clear that this was no mere side project—it was the future of King Crimson, with a knotty, new wave sound that imagined if Talking Heads had met at music school instead of art school.  was the first in a trio of releases that found the band flirting, however hermetically, with the pop world in the form of music videos and dance remixes.

"“That’s Life” is 88-Keys’ first solo song in 8 yearsProducer and rapper 88-Keys has shared a new track called “That’s Life” featuring the late Mac Miller and Sia. It’s out now via 1801/Warner Records. Hear it below.“That’s Life” was originally recorded in New York City while 88-Keys and Miller were in the studio together. It marks 88’s first song as a solo artist in eight years. Of the new song, 88 said in a press release:""That’s Life” is a song which sums up the sentiments of the music I’ve been working on over the past few years. We all have to forge through the good, the bad and the ugly. Mac came up with the concept for the song stemming from a conversation we had in the studio about relationships as we shared with each other what made the ones we were in at the time special. I played the song for Sia and she personally identified with the sentiments of the song and felt strongly about contributing her own thoughts on the subject matter.

"Listen to the track belowOver the past decade, Caroline Polachek has led several artistic lives over. As half of beloved indie pop group Chairlift, she wielded her bright falsetto like a secret weapon, detonating their groove-based songs with blasts of vitality, sadness, or both. The laptop-bred alter ego Ramona Lisa allowed Polachek to turn inward, crafting melodic, pastoral pop songs that paved the way for CEP, an ambient side project of “useful” music for passive activities. Now, with the arrival of “Door,” a song simply credited to Caroline Polachek, a new sense of significance lingers—in what direction does a musical polyglot go when presenting a project attributed only to herself?Airy and sprawling, “Door” is as elliptical and strange as Chairlift’s most unconventional moments, but shot through with a romantic open-heartedness that’s all Polachek. Her diaphanous voice flits through various processors, sounding like she’s singing from another room entirely at one point before returning to a liquid, cool delivery. The kaleidoscopic, essential video renders the song in surreal visions of endless mirrors, doorways, and warped fields, with Polachek and a pair of greyhounds as guiding spirits. Taking an understated, strange approach to the pro forma pop song, “Door” coasts on gentle programmed drums, finger-picked acoustic guitar, and synths as sharp as gasps. But it’s Polachek’s wistful, memorable hook, journeying through a series of doorways to someone forever on the other side, that pushes “Door” to its peak. Collapsing into an agile vocal solo, “Door” ends on an ethereal and emotive note, providing an off-kilter introduction to a new era of Polachek’s spare pop music.",articles4,"['Caroline Polachek', 'Ramona Lisa', 'Caroline Polachek', 'Chairlift’s']"

Sitting solo at a piano, Kline told the stories of these items in relation to her own existence; her minimal instrumentation mimicked her equally personal, solitary lyrics. On “Windows,” the lead single from Frankie Cosmos’ forthcoming album Close It Quietly Kline returns to her guitar and full band with a broader theme to match: “learning to see yourself as part of the whole.” Those objects she once saw as discrete miniatures now flood together as a massive galaxy, in which Kline seeks her space as a single star.Kline gazes through windows out onto a grand new view. “I know how to forgive those/Sceneries for surrounding me/But you did it differently,” she sings, nodding to a relationship that’s steered her off course. Looking to her internal compass, she embraces her blunders as she pieces herself back together: “Do I have regrets? Certainly… Do I bounce? I bounce back,” she promises, backed by subtly sparkling synths and cymbal hits. There’s a place in the world for Kline, and though the ride there may be bumpy, she fits as seamlessly as the final piece of a jigsaw puzzle.",articles4,[None]

"Last month, Apple brought back the iPod. Supposedly. On May 28, the tech giant announced the seventh-generation iPod Touch, which is essentially a stripped-down version of a smartphone, or a smaller, cheaper iPad (the price starts at $199). Still, it’s technically Apple’s first new iPod model since 2015.Music lovers have no reason to care about this device. The iPod Touch has little in common with the beloved iPod Classic (discontinued in 2014), or even the Shuffle and Nano (put out to pasture in 2017). But if you, like me, involuntarily perked up a little at the thought of Apple bringing back the iPod, this gadget is just another disappointing reminder of how far gone that era really is.Apple has claimed this latest iPod Touch is twice as fast as its predecessors, and hey, it’s zipping along just fine during my early use. Games and augmented reality purportedly work better on this iPod Touch than previous iPod Touches. But the computer hardware facilitating this increased speed is the same processor found in the iPhone 7, the oldest iPhone model the company sells today. If you have seen or used an iPhone at any point in the past 10 years, you already have a good idea of what it’s like to use this iPod. There is one feature that will appeal to audiophiles who are still resisting the transition to wireless headphones: It has a honest-to-goodness headphone jack.Actually listening to music on this thing is, yes, pretty much exactly the same as listening to music on an iPhone. The device seamlessly tapped into my collections on Apple Music and Spotify and eventually synced manually via my desktop iTunes; YouTube played videos as YouTube does. Honestly, the biggest trouble was, with nearly identical shiny rectangles sitting side by side on my desk, it was hard to know which one to pick up to make a phone call.This is all a far cry from what was once remarkable about the iPod. As Hazel Cills noted in this space in 2015, the iPod was a device for , and its enduring appeal had to do with  everything else a smartphone can do. “The benefits of an iPod are the ability to literally contain your entire music library and ... to enjoy it without the temptation to blindly scroll through Instagram or tweets while you do so,” she wrote. Streaming music is a tradeoff for the sake of convenience, which Apple (and Spotify, and the music industry at large) has none too subtly pushed many of us to make. But it’s not the same as MP3 ownership, as losing yourself in music that you painstakingly compiled and put on an iPod because you just needed Joanna Newsom’s discography on you at all times, Wi-Fi access be damned.With streaming now constituting 75 percent of industry revenue (and growing), Apple’s recent decision to start phasing out iTunes, at least as an app for storage purposes, feels almost moot. Partly by consumers’ own choice and partly because tech companies left us with no other choice, the concept of owning music and listening to it on a dedicated player has gone from mainstream to niche in the matter of a few years. Download sales, which represented 42 percent of the industry in 2013, were down to an 11 percent share of the market last year. My old iPod has been sitting idle in a dresser drawer since well before that. Something new awaits, but those years of personally downloaded and assembled playlists, which could be listened to without distractions from other apps, are resoundingly done.",articles4,"['Apple’s', 'iPod Touches', 'iPhone', 'iPhone', 'Spotify', 'Instagram', 'Spotify', 'MP3', 'Joanna Newsom’s', 'Apple’s']"

"Listen to the track belowIt’s been 10 years since Sam Shepherd began releasing music as Floating Points, and on his very first releases—the breakbeat-fueled “K&G Beat,” the sashaying “Vacuum Boogie”—the UK producer directed his focus squarely at the dancefloor. Over the past decade, Floating Points’ music has gotten looser and more diffuse, dissolving from the jazz-kissed garage of 2011’s  EP to the vaporous, improvisatory , his masterpiece to date. But with his new single “LesAlpx,” Shepherd returns to those long-dormant dancefloor instincts.“LesAlpx” is as driven a track as Shepherd has ever made, and as stripped bare: The bulk of it is taken up by a swinging, unstoppable drum groove. He brings color to the insistent, one-note bassline by dialing in a glowing layer of overtones in constant flux, his fingers restless on the knob. It’s an exercise in careful restraint—until it isn’t. First, an even boomier bass throb, unfathomably deep, cracks the space wide open; then, after a fadeout and false ending, he goes full prog, picking up the beat and laying on a lugubrious synthesizer melody that is the precise opposite of his spring-loaded drums, as though his coiled clockworks were suddenly replaced by one of Salvador Dalí’s melting clocks. It’s music befitting a sci-fi epic, or a sorcerer’s rites.",articles4,"['Sam Shepherd', 'Salvador Dalí']"

"Late in the new film , there is a sequence soundtracked by Scott McKenzie’s 1967 hippie standard “San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair).” But instead of using the cheeseball original version, director Joe Talbot commissioned a gorgeous cover sung by Michael Marshall, best known for his hook on the Bay Area rap anthem “I Got 5 on It.” For the revamp, Talbot also drafted Norwegian jazz artist Daniel Herskedal, whose tuba playing is meant to evoke the foghorns of Hunters Point, the historically African-American neighborhood where much of the movie is set. Like the film itself, the soulful cover is steeped in Bay Area specificity, built from unlikely inspirations, and born of a deep collaborative spirit. is Talbot’s debut feature and much of it was inspired by the life of Jimmie Fails, who plays the film’s main character, also named Jimmie Fails. The movie is ostensibly about Fails’ attempt to reclaim a Victorian house in the Fillmore District built by his grandfather, but really it’s about him trying to figure out his place in a city that’s in the final stages of an irrevocable identity change brought on by gentrification.Talbot and Fails met as kids, when Talbot was, as he puts it, “the white kid that made beats for a lot of local rappers.” His longtime obsession with music is felt in the film through his inventive use of Jefferson Airplane’s “Somebody to Love” and Joni Mitchell’s “Blue,” but also in the hilarious cameos from San Francisco icons like the Dead Kennedys’ Jello Biafra, who plays a Segway-riding tour guide, and the rapper San Quinn.  is also bolstered by a score from composer Emile Mosseri, whose stirring pieces add depth to moments when victory is within grasp or when the realization of failure hits. Speaking over the phone about the details of his film’s sweeping soundtrack, Talbot says, “Music is the only thing that I think I love more than movies.”Joe Talbot: Yeah. I grew up in a very musical household. My dad in particular raised me on a lot of the great music from the ’60s in San Francisco—Jefferson Airplane, Moby Grape, Big Brother [and the Holding Company]. And movie scores, too. My parents played  soundtrack and . And sometimes all those things would combine. I’d sample some weird soundtrack or an old San Francisco song for a beat that I was making. One of the first beats I made was this terrible, butchered version of the song that’s in the movie, Scott McKenzie’s “San Francisco.”It’s a funny one, because my parents are old San Francisco lefties, and for a lot of people, including them, that song was seen as a hokey slice of hippie pop. It was written by John Phillips of the Mamas & the Papas as sort of marketing material: Local authorities were afraid of all the kids descending on Monterey for Monterey Pop, so he wrote that song to assuage their anxieties.So my parents didn’t play that song, but I kind of loved it when I heard it because, by that time, it felt warm and nostalgic. San Francisco has this obsession with its past, and music from that ’60s period conjures very strong feelings from people who lived through it and even for people like me, who were raised on stories of that time. When we started thinking about this movie, we wanted to take music from that period and update it into a newer, darker, stranger San Francisco that lives in a more perilous place. We were thinking about who could add a new twist to these old standards. Michael Marshall was one of the first people we thought about, and the first time he sang “San Francisco,” it moved us to tears.Jello embodies a certain part of what I feel like is being lost in San Francisco. He has that great, twisted sense of humor. He came into our first audition with like 20 different possible outfits. I think he reveled in being a shithead in the film a little bit, which is why Jello is great.San Quinn is another one of those guys. I grew up listening to him. What’s interesting about Quinn is he’s got that beautiful, deep, almost preacher-ly voice. He’s also this great orator. In some ways, it was too bad we didn’t get to use more of him, because he’s an incredible storyteller. He’ll just sit with you and tell you about Mac Dre and what happened in Kansas City [where Mac Dre was shot and killed in 2004]. He’ll talk about what Fillmore was like and the beef between people that lived in Victorians versus the kids in the projects. He’s part of the fabric of the city.Oftentimes, making beats can be a gateway into tracking down the original music, and you get into music through something that was sampled in a rap song. I first heard Mac Dre’s song where he samples “Blue” at a funeral for someone I knew who had been killed when I was a teenager. It always stuck with me because it wasn’t the music I would expect to hear at a funeral. But it was one of that kid’s favorite songs. I eventually found out where it came from. I must have been playing it, and my dad was like, “Someone fucking sampled Joni Mitchell?” Initially I wanted to use Mac Dre’s song [in the scene] as well, but unfortunately he hadn’t cleared the rights.I wrote some music before we actually even wrote the script to help me flesh out the world and think about what the movie could look like and feel like but, to be honest, I just didn’t have anywhere near the chops to do the score. I spent a lifetime around music and working on it in some way, but there are so many things I don’t know.Early on, I had these hopes of working with the people that made the music for films that I had grown up on, like Carter Burwell or Danny Elfman. But I realized that on an indie film like this, particularly with me being a first-time director, guys like that were most likely not going to allow me the kind of back-and-forth I was able to have in every other part of this film. Music is so important to the feeling in this film that the idea that I wouldn’t be able to get my grubby little hands in there and actually work with someone made me really nervous.But when I met Emile, we bonded; he and I talk every day, still. He’s really grounded and not afraid, so he would let me be in there singing him shit and never be like, “Hey man, get the fuck out here. Let me do my thing.” It was really collaborative, and he wanted to honor this thing I had been living with for five years. He actually listened to my input and then took it to levels I hoped for but never imagined.",articles4,"['Scott McKenzie’s', 'Your Hair', 'Joe Talbot', 'Hunters Point', 'Talbot’s', 'Jimmie Fails', 'Jimmie Fails', 'Jefferson Airplane', 'Joni Mitchell', 'Emile Mosseri', 'Moby Grape', 'Big Brother', 'John Phillips', 'Mamas & the Papas', 'San Quinn', 'Mac Dre', 'Mac Dre', 'Joni Mitchell', 'Mac Dre’s']"

"Yang Hyun-suk has resigned from the company he helped found over 20 years ago (Big Bang, Psy, BLACKPINK)YG Entertainment is one of the biggest music companies in the K-pop industry, one of the institutions considered a part of the “Big Three” label groups in South Korea (which also includes SM Entertainment and JYP Entertainment). Today, it’s been announced that founder Yang Hyun-suk and his brother, CEO Yang Min-suk, have resigned from the company following sustained allegations of the company’s involvement in drug scandals involving artists that were signed to their roster, as Billboard reports.“I’ve dedicated the past 23 years of my life to YG Entertainment. It was my greatest joy to support the best music and the best artists,” Yang Hyun-suk wrote in a statement posted to the YG Entertainment website earlier today. “From today onward, however, I have decided to step down from my responsibilities and positions at YG.”Founded in 1996, YG has served the label home for various notable K-pop acts including Big Bang, Psy, and recently, BLACKPINK. The company came under scrutiny earlier this year after the “Burning Sun” scandal, in which reports emerged that drug use and sexual abuse had taken place at the Burning Sun nightclub, owned by Big Bang member Seungri. On Tuesday, June 11, a whistleblower filed a report with South Korea’s Anti-Corruption and Civil Rights Commission regarding alleged collusion by the label to cover up a drug offense by another artist, the rapper and singer-songwriter B.I of iKON, as Korea Herald reports. This development led to Yang Hyun-suk’s resignation earlier today.A member of the seminal K-pop group Seo Taiji & Boys in the 1990s, Yang became a household name in Korea through YG and his tenure as a judge on various South Korean singing competition shows in the 2010s. In concluding his resignation statement, Yang wrote: “Finally—through thorough investigation of the media reports and the facts, I believe that the truth will come to light.”",articles4,"['Yang Hyun', 'South Korea', 'Today', 'Yang Hyun', '“I’ve', 'Yang Hyun', 'Big Bang', 'BLACKPINK', 'Big Bang', 'Seungri', 'iKON', 'Yang Hyun', 'Korea']"

"“It will be a smart, funny workplace comedy full of commentary about everything from gentrification to sex to tech to call-out culture”MTV Studios has clarified its plans for the reboot of ’90s cult cartoon “Daria,” as The Hollywood Reporter notes. “Jodie” will focus on Daria’s friend Jodie Landon, who will be voiced by Tracee Ellis Ross. The series takes place in the years after Lawndale High and will follow Jodie as she enters the tech industry in her first job after college.Of the forthcoming show, Ross said in a press release:Being able to give voice to fresh, feminist and unexplored stories of
young women excites me. “Jodie” will spin off from the cult classic
“Daria,” and with the brilliant, sweet and sarcastic black-girl magic
that is Jodie Landon, we will feature a diverse cast, comprised mainly
of unapologetically smart and ambitious young female characters who
are vulnerable and flawed and interesting and funny. As a very cool
bonus, Jodie will be the first adult animated show in almost 20 years
that will star a black woman. It will be a smart, funny workplace
comedy full of commentary about everything from gentrification to sex
to tech to call-out culture.“Jodie” will reportedly be the first in a series of spinoff shows from MTV Studios, constituting a “‘Daria’ universe.” A network for the cartoon has not yet been announced. Characters from the original “Daria” series will make an appearance in the new spinoff.Last year, MTV Studios announced the new series “Daria & Jodie,” which was set to “reinvent” the original series “through the eyes of heroine Daria Morgendorffer and one of her closest friends Jodie Landon.” The show, which will still be written by Grace Nkenge Edwards, will now focus more closely on Jodie.“Daria” was originally a spinoff of Mike Judge’s raunchy cartoon “Beavis and Butt-Head.” It ran for five seasons on MTV from 1997-2002.Tracee Ellis Ross recently starred in Tyler, the Creator’s IGOR visual “EARFQUAKE.” Last year, she appeared in Drake’s star-studded “Nice for What” music video.",articles4,"['Tracee Ellis Ross', 'Ross', '“Jodie', 'Mike Judge’s', 'Butt-Head', 'Creator’s']"

"“Omertà” and the Rick Ross-featuring “Money in the Grave” will arrive tomorrow to celebrate the Raptors’ victory over the WarriorsDrake—Toronto Raptors superfan, occasional nuisance, and global ambassador—will release two new songs tomorrow to celebrate his favorite team’s first NBA title. One is called “Omertà,” and the other is a Rick Ross-featuring track called “Money in the Grave.” He wrote: “THE CHIP TO THE 6!!!!!!!!!!!!” Check out the artwork below.Tonight, in a post-game interview, Drake discussed the win with reporters. “We did this off of heart. We did this off of love,” he said. “We willed this into existence. We manifested this. I told you the first time. People like to make memes—make another meme out of this. It’s beautiful.”https://twitter.com/WordOnRd/status/1139391307405639680Drake has been especially vocal throughout the Raptors’ run to the NBA Finals. In May, during the Eastern Conference Finals, Drake interacted directly with Raptors coach Nick Nurse on the sideline. He was also criticized by Milwaukee Bucks fans for what they saw as disrespectful antics on the sidelines. Georgios Dimitropoulos (a senior executive at the European agency that used to represent Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo) tweeted, “Never seen anything as disrespectful as this before....” He later deleted the tweet.Following Dimitropoulos’ tweet, Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said:I don’t know how much he’s on the court. It sounds like you guys are
saying it’s more than I realize. There’s certainly no place for fans
and, you know, whatever it is exactly that Drake is for the Toronto
Raptors. You know, to be on the court, there’s boundaries and lines
for a reason, and like I said, the league is usually pretty good at
being on top of stuff like that.Drake, in turn, responded indirectly with photos and emoji. Following the Raptors’ series victory over the Bucks, NBA officials spoke with Drake about his behavior.During Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Drake wore Dell Curry’s No. 30 Toronto Raptors jersey (pictured above). Dell Curry played for the Raptors from 1999 to 2002. His son, Stephen Curry, has won three NBA titles with the Warriors.Also during Game 1, Drake exchanged words with the Warriors’ Draymond Green. “We talked; we barked a little bit. But I wouldn’t necessarily consider it a scuffle. [It wasn’t] what I personally would consider a scuffle,” Green said.Off the court, San Francisco radio station KBLX stopped playing Drake’s music during the Finals. “Our listeners are in absolute support of the station’s decision to ban all Drake music until the NBA finals are had by Stephen Curry and the Warriors,” KBLX program director Elroy Smith told Variety. “Drake started it by disrespecting the Warriors. His taunting toward the Warriors must stop.”Read Pitchfork’s op-ed feature “My Dinner With Drake.”

"Music comes naturally to Diana Silvers. Last summer, the 21-year-old wandered into a Guitar Center, left with a bass guitar and amp, and started practicing her favorite classic rock and psychedelic tunes. Now, she’s proficient enough to upload those four-string covers to Instagram. And if she needs a backing band, she has one on standby: The Los Angeles native, who says she “probably cares about music more than anything else,” likens her equally artistic family to the Von Trapps.Silvers’ talents, though, are typically found on the big screen. The fast-rising actress currently costars with Octavia Spencer in the thriller  and has an ensemble role in the coming-of-age comedy . In the former, Silvers plays an unassuming new girl in town whose friend group is invited to parties in a lonely woman’s basement, unaware of their host’s gruesome intentions. In , Silvers plays Hope, a beautiful, standoffish classmate of over-studious best friends Molly (Beanie Feldstein) and Amy (Kaitlyn Dever), who delivers both sharp-tongued dismissals of her peers and an opportunity for the meek Amy to embrace her sexuality.As Hope, Silvers exudes effortless cool in a fringed vintage jacket and heavy-lidded stare. Offscreen, she has equally groovy taste in music: Pink Floyd, the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, and other classics. Calling from California, Silvers tells us about the music she’s currently rocking.I used to make my dad mix CDs. He would tell me what songs to put on them, and one of them had “Foxey Lady.” Last summer, I got really into ‘60s psychedelic music, and I finally listened to . I was like, “Man, this is incredible!” I think “The Wind Cries Mary” is my favorite Jimi Hendrix song. Obviously, he’s one of the greatest guitarists of all time, but even his lyrics are really meaningful. In psychedelic rock, there’s so much going on and so many different sounds. You can go back and find new things to listen for, which is really special. I was reading something about how different frequencies in music make you feel certain ways; this album makes me feel like I’m high, even though I don’t do drugs.The White Album is so cool because it was around the time when the Beatles started to not like each other, so they would each go off and do their own thing. It’s all over the place, but that’s what makes the album so brilliant. You can listen to each of their solo work, and then come back to this, and it’s so obvious who did what—like, “that’s  a George song,” or “that’s  a Paul song.” The first time I really listened to the White Album was during my first heartbreak, in my freshman year of college. I really resonated with “Long, Long, Long”—it’s so beautiful but so depressing. “Rocky Raccoon” and “Dear Prudence” are my favorite Beatles songs, and I played “I’m So Tired” a lot during finals week. The Beatles are my favorite band of all time, hands down.I truly believe Lorde is the voice of our generation. When a relationship ends, all you can do is play in your head everything that happened between you. I never knew what to call it, and then I heard “Supercut.” How did she know exactly how I felt, and encapsulate it so eloquently into this song that slaps? And “Liability”: “I am a toy that people enjoy/’Til all of the tricks don’t work anymore.” Again, how did she know? She said it better than I could even  it. She’s above us, yet she’s one of us. I was supposed to see Lorde on the  Tour in New York with my best friend, but then I got a callback for  in L.A. and couldn’t make the concert.

"New York-based singer-songwriter Raveena makes silky R&B that delves into trauma and maps out paths to healing. Her debut album, , begins in murky confusion, all warbled synth and whispered lyrics, as she obliquely addresses the people who have hurt her in the past. Gradually, over the course of 12 songs, her sound becomes bolder and clearer, finding strength in everything from sun showers to her mother’s resilience to her own femininity and womanhood.“Petal” ends the album on a euphoric note, wrapping layered vocals into a cocoon that’s delicate and full like a peony bloom. The song’s catharsis doesn’t come from conquering obstacles entirely, but from making peace with them. “Petal” follows “Nani’s Interlude,” in which Raveena’s grandmother talks about accepting the death of her husband as she faces her own mortality. On “Petal,” Raveena takes her grandmother’s advice to heart, finding joy in her own insignificance. She sings about feeling like “a speck inside an endless feed,” or “a petal floating in the breeze”; she ends by singing, “I am weightless/Knowing death is soon to come.” In any other context, the words would be morbid, but gliding in a celestial wash of falsetto and reverb, they sound freeing.",articles4,"['Nani’s', 'Raveena’s']"

"Invisible Hits“Life isn’t about finding yourself—or about finding ,” Bob Dylan says in Martin Scorsese’s , out this week on Netflix. “Life is about creating yourself.” For well over half a century, Dylan’s documentarians have been trying to capture that process in action. In many ways, their efforts are as essential to his myth as the music, even if these filmmakers often fail at fully decoding that myth. The very definition of a moving target, Dylan is impossible to pin down—after all, he’s the guy who boastingly sang “nothing is revealed” back in 1967. But these documentaries from over the decades reveal plenty. They follow in chronological order, based on the time period they portray.Dylan was a mainstay at the annual Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island every summer from 1963 to 1965, starting as a Guthrie-esque protest singer and ending up a folk-rock . Murray Lerner’s  expertly tracks this metamorphosis. First, we see Dylan in 1963, performing such socially conscious tunes as “Only a Pawn in Their Game” and earnestly leading a who’s-who of folk luminaries for a festival-closing “Blowin’ in the Wind.” One year later, he’s delivering a hallucinatory performance of “Mr. Tambourine Man.” And then, most famously,  presents Dylan’s 1965 “plugged-in” debut, which split the folk world in two. The absolutely ferocious rendition of “Maggie’s Farm” from that day remains a complete thrill, with Dylan barking out the words over Michael Bloomfield’s screaming guitar. (You can rent or buy this movie via iTunes.)For a fuller picture of the Newport Folk Festival’s early days, check out Lerner’s 1967 film , which features stellar performances by Mississippi John Hurt, the Staple Singers, Judy Collins, and many more.A few months before Dylan went electric at Newport, he embarked on a sold-out tour of England. Documentarian D.A. Pennebaker tagged along for the ride. His resulting film, , captures Bob playing solo acoustic to audiences whose reverence borders on the religious. Dylan, of course, is suspicious of such devotion, and  is highlighted by off-stage encounters with fans and press that are confrontational, to say the least. It’s a great fly-on-the-wall piece of documentary filmmaking, but it also works as a compelling drama. Using real-life situations and people (with the charismatic Dylan center stage), Pennebaker constructs a narrative as cohesive and complete as any fictional work. Added bonus:  famously kicks off with one of the great pre-MTV music videos, the much-imitated flip-card “Subterranean Homesick Blues” sequence.  (You can rent or buy this movie via Amazon or iTunes.)Dylan hired Pennebaker again for his candle-burning-at-both-ends 1966 European tour with the Hawks, who were soon to morph into The Band. This time, Pennebaker and his crew were shooting in full color, fitting the more hallucinatory sounds of this era. Following the tour, Dylan rejected the rough edit Pennebaker delivered, titled . Working in tandem with cameraman/editor Howard Alk, the songwriter used Pennebaker’s footage to make , a disjointed anti-documentary that has only been shown a handful of times and never been released on home video. Too bad. It’s not an easy watch by any means, but  does feature plenty of incredible live clips and oddly beautiful cinematography, and offers valuable insight into Dylan’s amphetamine-frazzled mid-’60s psyche.Martin Scorsese made Pennebaker’s 1966 footage the connective tissue of his three-and-a-half-hour 2005 doc, , which traced Dylan’s rise from his Minnesota childhood to his NYC coffeehouse days to his electric period. The film’s coup was securing its ever-cagey subject’s participation—from a distance, at least, seeing as Dylan’s manager interviewed him, not Scorsese. In some surprisingly candid segments taped in the early 2000s, Dylan provides a clear-eyed—if still characteristically enigmatic—account of his earliest days, complemented by interviews with Joan Baez, Suze Rotolo, Pete Seeger, and many others. A necessary deep-dive into Dylan’s rise,  is also packed with fantastic performances, from solo acoustic protest anthems to dangerously high-flying excursions with the Hawks. (You can rent this movie via Amazon or iTunes.)The cameras were rolling constantly during Dylan’s legendary Rolling Thunder Revue tour in the fall of 1975; apparently more than 90 hours of footage was shot. Dylan spent the next several years editing it all down into , a sometimes fascinating, often incomprehensible four-hour flick that was savaged by critics upon release and has never been released in any home video format (it makes regular appearances on YouTube, however). Now, Martin Scorsese and co. have trawled through the original footage to make . The performances—most of them previously unseen—are exceptional. We see Bob and his band rehearsing in NYC; raging through a spellbinding “Isis,” Dylan  guitar, eyes wild; crashing a Massachusetts mahjong parlor; playing “The Ballad of Ira Hayes” at the Tuscarora Indian Reservation; and performing for a tiny group of inmates at Clinton State Prison in New Jersey.Even though  is practically a Ken Burns production compared to , the film is not an entirely straightforward doc. Alongside the usual talking heads, Scorsese throws in a fictional Dutch filmmaker, a wholly imaginary concert promoter, a Robert Altman character—and even Sharon Stone, claiming to have had an affair with Dylan during the tour. Bob plays along with all of it, sneakily avoiding the real-life turmoil that consumed him at the time. “When someone’s wearing a mask, he’s gonna tell you the truth,” he claims in the film. But let’s not forget that Dylan has opened virtually every one of his shows since 2013 with a song that includes the lines, “All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie.” (You can stream this movie via Netflix.)The Rolling Thunder Revue reconvened in 1976, but the vibes on that tour were much less celebratory. Dylan’s marriage was crashing and burning, his foul mood is on full display in , a doc filmed during a very wet Fort Collins, Colorado, stadium show. Howard Alk’s camera captures Dylan in unflinching closeups—the viewer isn’t in the crowd but rather right onstage, up in Dylan’s face. It’s uncomfortable but still gripping, especially when he and his turban-wearing band deliver such feisty performances as a punk-tinged “Shelter From the Storm,” a bawdily rewritten “Lay Lady Lay,” and best of all, a harrowing “Idiot Wind.” Here, Dylan makes the threatening storm clouds above the stadium seem positively tame in comparison.Infamously, Dylan found Jesus in the late 1970s, recording three so-called “born again” LPs that left a hefty portion of his fanbase confused and disappointed. That era has been re-evaluated in recent years, thanks in part to the excellent 2017  release, . Included with that set was a fantastic new documentary, , featuring a wealth of gospel-tinged performances. Regardless of where you fall in the spiritual spectrum, Dylan’s passionate intensity in these clips is utterly convincing, whether on fire-and-brimstone rockers like “Slow Train Coming” or powerful slow jams for the Lord like “Pressing On.” Best of all, though, is a non-religious number: an in-studio cover of Dion’s “Abraham, Martin & John,” performed here as a heart-wrenching duet with singer Clydie King. Missing from the doc are the apocalyptic sermons Dylan would deliver onstage in 1979 and 1980; instead, we get actor Michael Shannon ominously intoning evangelical homilies in an atmospherically lit church. An odd touch, but it works, giving  a richer context.As was the case for many of his peers, things got weird for Dylan in the 1980s. Weirdest of all was , the dismal 1987 film Bob co-starred in with Rupert Everett and Fiona Flanagan. But something good did come of the songwriter’s part in this dud—namely, the BBC’s , one of the most revealing and interesting Dylan portraits ever made. Its 50+ minutes are dominated by a tetchy interview filmed between  takes, with a wired Bob in full  mode. He gives interviewer Christopher Sykes an extremely hard time, refusing to give easy answers (or any real answers at all). “Listen, I’ve come through good times and bad times, you know?” he says, glaring at his interrogator through wired eyes. “So I’m not fooled by good times or bad times.” It’s riveting stuff—and shows that Dylan had plenty of fire left in him at this career low point. The end of the doc is worth the price of admission alone, with Dylan chatting outside of his trailer with some pre-teen metalheads (who might not even know who they’re talking to). “You guys like Ozzy?” Bob asks, suddenly morphing into a friendly uncle. “How ’bout Ratt?”",articles4,"['“Life', 'Dylan’s', 'Michael Bloomfield', 'Pennebaker', 'Pennebaker', 'The Band', 'Pennebaker', 'Pennebaker’s', 'The film’s', 'Scorsese', 'Joan Baez', 'We see Bob', 'Ira Hayes', 'Ken Burns', 'Sharon Stone', 'Thunder Revue', 'Martin & John', 'Clydie King', 'Weirdest', 'Rupert Everett']"

"“And so this is our duty at every moment. To love without compromise and without equivocation.”Yesterday (June 12), was Loving Day, a commemoration of the 1967 Supreme Court decision Loving v. Virginia, which struck down laws banning interracial marriage. To celebrate, Sufjan Stevens has penned an essay about love. He begins the essay with quotes from RuPaul (“If you can’t love yourself, how the hell you gonna love somebody else?”) and Jesus (“Love your neighbor as yourself”).Later, invoking Adam and Eve, he discusses shame: “It’s astounding how much of our world still continues to teach us to feel shame,” he writes. “For the color of our skin. For our poverty. For our wealth. For our education. For our religion. For our privilege. For our special need. For our sexuality. For being naked in a garden.”Sufjan then offers love as the way to “break this pattern” of shame: “We must go back to the beginning. We must be born again. We must be, and know, and love ourselves.” Read the full essay at Sufjan’s website.Sufjan Stevens recently shared the songs “Love Yourself” and “With My Whole Heart” for Pride Month.",articles4,"['Sufjan Stevens', 'Sufjan’s', 'Sufjan Stevens']"

"Listen to the track belowAs Black Belt Eagle Scout, Katherine Paul often draws on her childhood growing up in the Swinomish Indian Tribal Community—roots that hold deep meaning in the now Portland-based singer-songwriter’s music. Paul has said that her upbringing on a reservation has manifested into a sense of apprehension about society; her new single, “At the Party,” finds a slice of solace in navigating the human experience with similarly marginalized friends by her side. Here, “the party” is the crooked world Paul journeys in solidarity with her fellow POC; together, they make the best of life’s wayward turns.Waltzing drums propel the track, echoing like rolling thunder. “How is it you’ve suffered through this kind of love?/It puts you in a dark place, dark place,” Paul sings, her lyrics painting a corresponding cloudiness. Her hums sink into the mellow, winding instrumentation, creating a sonic palette that’s more funereal than festive. Even under such a shadow, “At the Party” holds up the light of communal persistence: “We will always sing,” she repeats, as the song ascends to a weightless outro. “I’ll think of you from a nice, nice place,” goes the final lyric, insisting that, come any storm, Paul’s friendships will serve as shelter.",articles4,"['Black Belt Eagle Scout', 'POC', 'Paul’s']"

"He will reportedly pay $150,000 to end the legal battle that began the week he was fired as director of the Queen filmBryan Singer, the ousted director of , has agreed to pay $150,000 to settle a lawsuit focused on allegations of sexual assault,  reports. Cesar Sanchez-Guzman sued Singer in December 2017, alleging that the director sexually assaulted him during a yacht party in 2003. Sanchez-Guzman was 17 at the time of the alleged incident.Sanchez-Guzman filed for bankruptcy in 2014, and in 2018, his lawsuit against Singer was listed as a potential asset. A bankruptcy trustee reached a settlement agreement with Singer’s attorneys and asked the court to approve a $150,000 settlement with Singer. Pending the settlement’s approval, the lawsuit will be dismissed with prejudice.Singer’s attorney Andrew Brettler released a statement about the settlement (via ). “The debtor filed a claim against Mr. Singer that he had no basis or legal right to file,” he wrote. “Mr. Singer has denied even knowing this individual, let alone allegedly having interacted with him more than 15 years ago. The decision to resolve the matter with the bankruptcy trustee was purely a business one, as litigation costs would well exceed the amount requested by the trustee to pay off the creditors who were owed money when the debtor filed for bankruptcy.”The lawsuit was filed the same week Singer was fired as director of , reportedly due to his multiple absences on set during filming. In January,  published an investigative report where four men accused Singer of the sexual assault of minors.The 2019 GLAAD Media Awards withdrew ’s nomination because of the allegations levied against Singer. Queen’s Brian May issued an apology for saying Singer “is innocent until proven guilty.”The film’s star Rami Malek, who won an Oscar for his performance as Freddie Mercury, addressed the allegations against Singer in an interview. “My heart goes out to anyone who has to live through anything like what I've heard and what is out there. It's awful, it's remarkable that this happens, I can appreciate so much what they've been through and how difficult this must be for them,” he said. “In the light of the Me Too era, that this somehow seems to exist after that, it's a horrible thing.”",articles4,"['Singer’s', 'Mr. Singer']"

"The move comes after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed a near-total ban on abortion into lawOn May 7, Georgia became one of multiple states to pass a so-called “heartbeat bill.” The law bans abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy (before many women know they’re pregnant). Instead of boycotting performances in the state in protest of the new law (as many entertainers have done), Ariana Grande performed in Atlanta on June 8. She then donated a portion of the proceeds from her “Sweetener World Tour” performance to Planned Parenthood Federation of America, TMZ and People report. She donated $250,000, according to the reports.Dr. Leana Wen, President/CEO of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, shared the following statement:Ariana Grande’s generous donation comes at a critical time—in Georgia
and across the country, anti-women’s health politicians are trying to
ban all safe, legal abortion. This is not what the American people
want, nor is it something they’ll stand for. Thanks to inspiring
support like hers, Planned Parenthood can continue to fight back—in
the courts, in Congress, in state houses, and in the streets—against
these dangerous attacks on people's health and lives. We are so
grateful to Ariana for her longstanding commitment to supporting
women’s rights and standing with Planned Parenthood to defend access

"On Tuesday morning, Radiohead released around 16 hours of  outtakes on Bandcamp, with the proceeds going to fight the climate crisis. This might have seemed strange to those not obsessively following the group, but Radiohead’s hand was essentially forced: The archival material—which includes long-sought alternate versions of “Lift” and “True Love Waits,” solo demos, and other sonic experiments—leaked online last week. How did this treasure trove of music, made more than 20 years ago by one of the most critically acclaimed bands of all time, find its way to the internet now? It involves a black-market rap leaker being outmaneuvered by one of the internet’s most active musical fanbases.It all began a few weeks ago, on May 26, when a user called Zimbra joined a Radiohead-oriented group on the chat app Discord, known as W.A.S.T.E. Central (yes, just like Radiohead’s official social network). Though this person’s entire presence in the Discord group has since been deleted, the initial responses to their comments make clear that Zimbra had access to and was teasing unreleased material from . When the album was given a 20th-anniversary reissue in 2017 (subtitled ), the box set included an exclusive cassette of demos and outtakes. Zimbra, whose handle echoes a classic Talking Heads song, seemed to have more where those came from.A little more than a week later, on June 3, a post on Reddit’s Radiohead channel sounded the alarm: A well-known leaker claimed to have 18 hours of tracks made by Thom Yorke during the recording of . Though the post didn’t mention Zimbra by name, the leaker had shared previews of the kinds of material first teased by Zimbra, reportedly asking $150,000 for the full stash, or $800 per studio track and $50 per live track. A dubiously sourced archive documenting the making of a momentous album—a fan’s holy grail, an artist’s private rough drafts, and a copyright lawyer’s worst nightmare—was effectively being held for “ransom,” as Jonny Greenwood later put it.On June 4, a user named Hoserama joined the Radiohead Discord chat. While Hoserama is the handle of a concert taper and trader who’s well known in online Radiohead circles, evidence later emerged that this user was not the longstanding Hoserama, but rather Zimbra pretending to be Hoserama. (“What if I make a Discord with that username. And then leak the entire thing as him?” a screenshot of an apparent chat log with Zimbra reads.) “Told you I’d be back,” this fake Hoserama posted last week, along with a link to a site hosting a 1.38-gigabyte cache of the outtakes in question—more than 17 hours’ worth. “More soon,” he promised, before quitting the group.The leak spread quickly. Amid much hand-wringing over hearing tracks that were never intended for public consumption, the Radiohead fan community began compiling a Google doc that outlines the contents of these 18 lengthy audio files. John Nicholas, the Google doc’s owner, is candid with me about the moral quandary of a leak that is not sanctioned by the artist. “In the situation we were placed in, it seemed that we were approaching something on the level of the  tapes or perhaps even , considering how many unreleased Thom solo demos were in this particular set,” he writes via email. “It made more sense to convince the leaker to share something of that magnitude without making a profit off the band’s work, which would have been the outcome had we not gone public with the leaker’s info.” The fans’ Reddit post, in other words, forced the leaker’s hand.Zimbra, who is prominent on the rap-leak forum Leakth.is, claims to have acquired the  sessions through the Leakth.is Discord group. “I advertised I had some unreleased Beatles,” Zimbra tells me via Discord direct message. “So I get a DM from a Hoserama account saying he has 18 hours of unreleased Radiohead… Google the username and of course I find the whole thing about him and concerts and so on. I figure well, this guy seems legit, he has snippets and everything which verify it’s really unreleased. I trade him after an hour of banter trying to learn how he got it.”Back on Leakth.is, Zimbra apparently offered one of the newly obtained versions of “Lift” for $500. “Considering that Kanye mumbling for 2 minutes sells for about $2K, I think that’s a pretty good deal right?” Zimbra tells me. “Turns out it’s not.” Direct messages start arriving consisting of “people just massively hating on me, some asking how much for all 18 hours… I toss the $150K figure to someone as a hypothetical because at some point you can just do the math... Then the Reddit post drops and at this point everyone kinda freaks out. I do, the now-known-false Hoserama account does, Reddit does too. And it leaks.”The actual Hoserama, whom I reach through several online accounts, denies taking part in the leak. “I’m not the guy who released the  sessions,” Hoserama says through the Radiohead Discord group, which he only joined after hearing about the drama. “It’s some guy, no idea who, who basically took my name.” Later over email Hoserama reiterates, “I had nothing to do with the Radiohead sessions.”John Nicholas, the Google doc guy, says the Reddit post helped shame Zimbra into posing as the more established Radiohead bootlegger and leaking the same files they had been trying to sell, just hours before. “I don’t get the sense that Zimbra is the actual thief, but none of his stories about how he obtained the files really add up either,” Nicholas writes. “In the end, he was so spooked by the chance of being outed beyond the private, Martin Shkreli-like trading circles that he briefly impersonated Hoserama.”For their part, Zimbra declines to comment on the record about who posted the leak. When it comes to Radiohead’s official release of it, Zimbra seems ambivalent. “Their response is for sure a very Radiohead-ish response,” Zimbra tells me via a secure email account. “Even my anxiety is giving me a confused look trying to figure out if this is good or bad. Sucks the whole $150k thing and ‘ransom’ was taken way out of context to the point of the band saying it, but oh well.”Nicholas, from the Google doc, actually concurs on this point. “Apparently the band is under the impression that they were being extorted by the original leaker,” he writes. “I don’t think that was Zimbra’s intent. While we’re not a fan of what Zimbra was trying to do, at all, he never told us anything to suggest he was trying to get money from the band, only from fans.”For now, who might have traded the  leak to Zimbra in the first place remains a mystery. “I’m pretty much as in the dark as you,” Zimbra writes to me. “The fake Hoserama is who I got it from initially. I tried to contact them afterwards… even tried to figure out myself who it was. But stuff like this happens. People will make alternate accounts to sell one specific thing if it’s too risky. I’d say that’s the case here.”Unsurprisingly, Nicholas has a theory about this as well. “The situation that makes the most sense to me is that these minidiscs were digitized by a third party so the band could choose material from them for the  box set, and that someone involved at the third party stole the files and traded them,” he says, but notes that Zimbra also mentioned having other Radiohead music that was not part of the leak. “It’s possible that there was a larger theft at work here.”This time, hyper-vigilant fans—and Radiohead themselves—appear to have made the best of a strange situation, transforming a leaker’s personal profit motive into charitable support for Extinction Rebellion: an environmental activist group that wants to save the physical world.",articles4,"['Tuesday', 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead’s', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead’s', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead Discord', 'Radiohead', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead', '’ Reddit', 'Zimbra', 'Beatles', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead', '”Back', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Reddit', 'Radiohead', 'Reddit', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead', 'Zimbra', 'Hoserama', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Zimbra', 'Radiohead', '”This', 'Radiohead']"
"The company says the bombshell story contains “inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings”After ’ bombshell story on a 2008 warehouse blaze that reportedly destroyed scores of classic master tapes, Universal Music Group has released a statement playing down the extent of the damage. The fire at Universal Studios Hollywood reportedly destroyed a priceless trove of master tapes, affecting artists including Nirvana, R.E.M., John Coltrane, Joni Mitchell, and Aretha Franklin, among many others, according to .In response, UMG wrote in a statement that, “while there are constraints preventing us from publicly addressing some of the details,” the incident “never affected the availability of the commercially released music nor impacted artists’ compensation.” They claim ’ story “contains numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets.” UMG provided no examples of inaccuracies, and, at the time of publication, the label’s spokesperson has not returned a request for elaboration.The statement adds that ’ article “conveniently ignores the tens of thousands of back catalog recordings that we have already issued in recent years—including master-quality, high-resolution, audiophile versions of many recordings that the story claims were ‘destroyed.’” It is unclear whether Universal denies certain master tapes were incinerated, or if the company simply believes reproductions have been made to “master-quality.” Pitchfork has emailed for further clarification.UMG goes on to say that, in the past five years, it has more than doubled “investment in storage, preservation and metadata enrichment,” as well as moving to support its “global efforts around capturing, preserving and future-proofing our many media assets.”In an internal memo to employees published by , Universal Music Group CEO Sir Lucian Grange wrote about the “heartbreaking” loss of archived material in the fire. “Let me be clear: we owe our artists transparency,” he wrote. “We owe them answers. I will ensure that the senior management of this company, starting with me, owns this.”According to , a Los Angeles law firm representing several UMG artists has sent a letter to Grange requesting a “complete inventory of all master recordings.”Yesterday (June 11), Questlove suggested on Twitter that the fire destroyed the possibility of reissues for classic Roots albums  and .

Below, watch the band’s performance of “Fill in the Blank,” filmed at Ohio’s Newport Music Hall. Will Toledo said of the new album in a statement:This is a compilation of songs from shows we played in 2018. We
recorded every show we did that year, and I went through about 50 of
them to get the final tracklist for this album. This isn’t necessarily
the best possible version of each track, but it’s some of the most fun
we’ve had on stage. I particularly remember the show we did in the
small French town of Amiens, maybe the smallest show we did that year,
and how great it felt to be up in people’s faces with everyone
plugging in to the music right away.The recordings we made of the shows came out very clean, so rather
than try to artificially recreate how it sounded in the different
venues night to night, I tried to give the whole album that
in-your-face feeling, like we’re playing the songs right in front of
you. When you’re onstage with everything happening at once, you never
really know what it sounds like in the room anyways; all you know is
how the music is feeling. Hopefully this will give you a sense of what
these shows felt like.The band is on the road this summer and fall. Find the dates below and get tickets here.

"DistroLock will allow artists to pre-register songs before they’re released or submitted to streaming servicesMusic distribution company DistroKid has announced DistroLock, a new web-based service that allows artists to upload their unreleased music to a database that is used to prevent the release of “leaked” content unofficially onto streaming services and other platforms. Developed in partnership with digital content identification company Audible Magic, the DistroLock program will generate a unique “audio fingerprint” for any song and add that fingerprint to the Audible Magic database, which currently contains “over 20 million media assets,” according to a press release.“Until now, there hasn’t been a definitive way for artists to say, ‘This is my audio, don’t let anyone else release it,’” DistroKid CEO Philip Kaplan said in a statement. “With the launch of DistroLock, any musician can preemptively register their audio to help ensure that unauthorized releases don’t see the light of day.”DistroLock is making its API freely available to any music distributors, streaming services, and social media networks that wish to integrate a validation protocol within their content chain in order to fight the proliferation of such fraudulent releases in the future. In addition to registering songs within the Audible Magic database, DistroLock gives users the ability to register their content with other detection services like the open-source AcoustID and YouTube Content ID.As part of the partnership between the two companies, all tracks uploaded to DistroKid will now be analyzed via Audible Magic’s RightsRx service, which cross-references the songs against the Audible Magic database. (In the past several months, Audible Magic has entered into similar partnerships with two other distribution companies, The Orchard and CDBaby.)In recent months, demos and other musical detritus from SZA, Beyoncé, Rihanna, and Playboi Carti have been uploaded to streaming services. In some cases, the fraudulent music has performed well on charts: The Rihanna hoax album (Fenty Fantasia’s ) hit No. 67 on iTunes’ worldwide albums chart; and the Carti leak (“Kid Carti” by Lil Kambo) briefly topped the U.S. Viral 50 chart on Spotify.The fraudulent “Kid Carti” was distributed onto Spotify via DistroKid.

and brighter and not so dire. And through the songs ran a line—the
most important theme of the whole record, I know now—about love, and
how nothing of value that I have created would exist without it, and I
better goddamn well keep my eye on it. Love is so powerful that people
made religion to give a name to it, but if we don’t treat it with a
sensitive touch, it disappears like smoke. I had a dream once, many
years ago, where I heard a voice say “God is love,” and I felt it with
my whole being. This record is a reminder of that dream.Hiss Golden Messenger’s last album was 2017’s Hallelujah Anyhow.",articles4,"['Aaron Dessner', 'Roger Moutenot', 'Messenger’s']"

"Earlier today, Radiohead released over 16 hours of unheard demos, rehearsals, outtakes, live performances, and other miscellany recorded around the time they were working on 1997’s . According to a statement from guitarist Jonny Greenwood, the band never wanted to put these recordings out, but once they realized someone had stolen a cache of MiniDiscs from Thom Yorke’s archive—and was reportedly demanding $150,000 to not release them—they decided to upload everything onto Bandcamp themselves. You can stream it all for free for the next 18 days only, or pay £18 for downloads, with the proceeds going to the environmental organization Extinction Rebellion. “So for £18 you can find out if we should have paid that ransom,” Greenwood quipped. For his part, Yorke wrote in the Bandcamp release’s description: “it’s not v interesting. there’s a lot of it.”He’s not completely wrong: Contextless recordings put out under duress in an unwieldy and unabridged format do not make for an ideal listening experience. Nevertheless, here we are. Vast swaths of this material—underdeveloped early drafts, eerie found sounds, random jams—would likely be notable to only the most diehard Radiohead fans (several of which have already created an annotated guide to the whole thing). And yet, there are a few moments of brilliance (and strangeness) that cut through: an alternate version of fan favorite “Lift” that could have topped the charts, a whole EP’s worth of Yorke singing unreleased songs with his acoustic guitar, a 12-minute take of “Paranoid Android.” There’s even one part where Yorke starts beatboxing. Here’s a selection of highlights, rarities, and oddities that we were drawn to most. (Special thanks to writer Matthew Perpetua for mapping out some of these gems before we did.)The fabled “Lift”—the song Radiohead chose not to release as the first single from  because it would have made them “too big,” the song with a story longer than this leak—was finally heard in studio-recorded form on 2017’s 20th-anniversary reissue, . This alternate version is even better. It’s not mixed very carefully, but it sounds scrappy and untamed, like the band is pushing it into the red unselfconsciously. It lives up to the myth. –Jeremy D. LarsonNormally, combing through a band’s alternate takes feels like settling on one of seven nearly-identical selfies. But Radiohead’s alternate takes are more like alternate conceptions—different lives the songs might have lived. Hearing the full-band version of “Motion Picture Soundtrack,” without the lush Bond-theme string arrangements that made it to the finished  studio version, is to see another Radiohead. The guitars chime, the cymbals splash quietly.  Radiohead never deviated from the path suggested by . Here, it’s very nearly another “Fake Plastic Trees.” –Jayson GreeneMost of the in-progress versions of “Paranoid Android” that appear on the leak are either scraps of rehearsal starting from various parts of the song or live versions from 1996, when Radiohead opened for Alanis Morissette. But this version answers the question: “What if Radiohead’s most expansive prog-rock opus was twice as long?” It’s rough and loose, with a few different lyrics. At one point, it descends into a kind of “Dazed and Confused” psychedelic section with lots of clicks and clacks on the rims of drum heads. It feels like a jam session waiting for someone to end it. –JDLThis previously unreleased track is pure yearbook-photo material, equal parts embarrassingly awkward and sweet. A simple, near-Britpop strummer, it sounds very nearly like Del Amitri’s inescapable 1995 hit “Roll to Me,” slowed down to half-tempo. Polished up in a studio, it could have soundtracked a late-’90s teen comedy, and you wouldn’t have blinked. –JGListening to these tapes, you’ll come across something that has the scuzzy fidelity of an early Mountain Goats tape or an old 78. There are two versions of ’ “Nude” to be found here—a full band take and this extremely lo-fi acoustic demo from Yorke that almost feels like someone trying to creepily cover it. This early draft is spectral and difficult to make out, but therein lies its allure: It allows you to trace its journey from this demo to the song we know. –JDLWell, this doesn’t really work, does it! Perhaps there is just too much lore around this song, which only existed as a cherished live bootleg for decades until a meditative version finally arrived on Radiohead’s latest album, . This early take pulls the song into an uncomfortable shape thanks to some spacey ELO synths and a regrettable wah-wah effect. It offers insight into why one of Radiohead’s most pure and uncynical songs was notoriously difficult to pin down. –JDLThis version removes the big old Tommy Iommi-style riff as well as the DJ Shadow-influenced stuttering beat from the center of ’s monolithic opener, and lo and behold, it becomes airy, sweet, nearly weightless—something an alternate-universe Radiohead could have performed on another MTV Spring Break. –JGThe version released on  features some of the best, simplest guitar arrangements Radiohead ever put to tape, an interwoven chime that makes it sounds like you are inside the bells of a church. If you never wanted those guitar notes to stop bubbling over, here is a 10-minute version of that. –JDLAs the closer to , the studio version of “Life in a Glasshouse” brimmed with near-apocalyptic intensity, Yorke’s voice mingling with the scream of New Orleans-style brass and woodwinds. This demo is a skeleton, just a hard-strummed acoustic and Yorke’s holler; the energy isn’t too far off from something like KT Tunstall’s 2004 hit “Black Horse and a Cherry Tree.” –JGThe solo Thom Yorke cuts sprinkled throughout the leak are winningly pure-hearted and lovely, in the simplest sense of the word. This song, which begins with Yorke yelping out a strangled “Maybe this is not the reason,” finds the singer exploring his pinched, pained upper reaches, where his chest voice breaks into falsetto. There is a hiccup in the tape somewhere in the middle, but even with that glitch, the song is a hauntingly indelible wail. –JGThere is a lost solo coffeehouse EP somewhere in this data dump, which Yorke might want to keep buried, but these humble takes showcase the larger-than-life frontman at his most vulnerable. The melodies to several Yorke solo demos from the leak didn’t seem to find homes in other Radiohead songs, perhaps because they were not dark enough, or maybe they didn’t lend themselves readily to full-band arrangements. (Or, knowing the pace at which Radiohead works on songs, perhaps they are still in development somewhere in the band’s collective unconscious.) –JG",articles4,"['Radiohead', 'Thom Yorke’s', 'Vast', 'Radiohead', 'But Radiohead’s', 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead', 'Alanis Morissette', 'Radiohead’s', 'Del Amitri’s', 'Radiohead’s', 'Radiohead’s', 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead', '“Life', 'Yorke’s', 'Yorke’s', 'Radiohead', 'Radiohead']"
"For most of the recordings on , a new Prince compilation featuring solo demos of songs written for other artists, the only other person in the room was Peggy McCreary. As Prince’s trusted audio engineer at Los Angeles’ Sunset Sound studio starting with 1981’s Controversy all the way through 1986’s , McCreary worked closely on the records that initially defined his career. This was Prince’s most prolific time period: In addition to his own five albums, he mentored acts including Vanity 6 and Sheila E. and wrote standalone hits like the Bangles’ “Manic Monday” and “Nothing Compares 2 U,” later Sinéad O’Connor’s signature song. It was also the era when Prince became a superstar. McCreary witnessed his transformation up close, one painstaking session at a time. “He told me once that the only reason he went home was because he knew I needed to sleep,” she recalls.Working with Prince—whose high maintenance, technophobic intensity still seems to summon an anxious tug in McCreary’s voice—was no easy feat. “I appreciated him a lot more when I wasn't working with him,” she jokes now. Like every frequent Prince collaborator, McCreary has great stories. Even though she says those endless hours in the studio rendered her memory foggy, she remembers him deciding at midnight that “Purple Rain” needed a string section, and how she taught him to use a mixing board so she could watch “Dallas” in the break room every once in a while. And if it weren’t for Prince, she might still be a smoker: He demanded she quit so that she’d stop taking breaks in the middle of their sessions.During our conversation, McCreary gave insight into the man behind all those recordings—a perfectionist whose constant drive to create left us with a body of work that’s still being uncovered and understood. , the latest posthumous release from Prince’s vault, is available on Tidal now and hits other streaming services on June 21; a physical release is due July 19.Peggy McCreary: I was a waitress at the Roxy Theatre on the Sunset Strip. I worked there for two years and I thought,  I really liked working around music, so I started taking classes, something called Sound Masters, and helping the sound men set up during the day. One time, [one of the sound guys] said to me, “If you’re serious about doing this, they are looking for a gopher at Sunset Sound.” So I went down and applied. They had never hired a woman before, and I think they hired me as a joke, thinking it’d be funny. But then I had good studio etiquette. I knew when to keep my mouth shut. I worked hard. I absorbed everything and helped every way that I could.Hollywood Sound [a nearby studio] had technical difficulties and their board went down. They called Sunset and said, “Do you have an engineer and a room available this weekend?” And I was available with a room, but the receptionist said, “Peggy can’t work alone in the studio on the weekend with him. He writes really dirty songs about giving head and stuff.” I thought,  So I was prepared for something different than the person that walked in, who was small and polite and extremely quiet. He would mumble what he needed from behind a flap of hair. I said, “You know what? If you want me to work with you, you’re going to have to talk to me, to my face, so I can hear you!” That was on , and we finished that album, and I thought, . But when he came back for 1999, he requested me. So I guess we did connect in some way. But he wasn’t real communicative, and he wasn’t very cordial. He didn’t have those basics that most people have—hello and goodbye and thank you.It was half and half. Sometimes he’d come with lyrics written on the hotel stationary. Sometimes he would sit at the piano and write on the back of track sheets or a napkin or whatever there was. I remember with “Manic Monday,” we had worked until about 5 or 6 in the morning, and he said, “Okay, we’ll be in at 6 tomorrow evening.” And I thought, . I got a call from the studio the next morning that he wanted to be in at noon. I wasn’t real happy when he walked in, but he had this big smile on his face and he waved some lyric sheets in front of me and said, “I said if I dreamed another verse I was coming in!” He was constantly composing, no matter where he was or what he was doing.I just think it’s where the song took him. I remember when we first did “When Doves Cry,” I didn’t pay much attention to it. It seemed like a big grandiose, overproduced thing. And when I listened to the original one, I see why. We came back the next day and he basically unproduced it—took out all the synths and the screaming guitars. The very last thing he did was take out the bass. He just looked at me and said, “Ain’t nobody going to believe I do this.” And it was a huge hit!He became different, yeah. There was a lot of pressure, especially for a 25-year-old kid. He had the last say over everything. But did he treat me differently? He always was Prince. I remember after , which was just me and him in the studio, we were working on Vanity 6, I think. I said, “Do you like my work?” And he looked at me like, “You’re here, aren’t you?” That’s all you ever got from him.I remember one day the Time came in, it was a shitty day. It didn't have anything to do with me, but I seemed to be the scapegoat. When Prince came in, I knew it was going to be a bad day by the way he was walking and how he was dressed. He had high-heeled boots, no shirt—which was very rare—a bandana tied around his head, and one around each knee. He was just strutting... and it was an  strut. I guess somebody had lost a tape and he was furious. So he came in, and he just rode me so hard. He was bitching about how white people didn’t have any rhythm—and it’s like, oh my god really? Your drummer is white! I remember looking over at Jimmy Jam [then a member of the Time] and he was looking at me like, “I’m so sorry it’s you, but I’m so glad it’s not me!”I think he was more comfortable around women in general. I think that’s why he surrounded himself with women. Women don’t have the same male ego conflict kind of thing. You just did what he needed you to do.Being a woman in the studio then, you either got a lot of hatred—that you shouldn’t be there—or a lot of unwanted attention, which you had to manage by not offending. And he was just… You were an equal. I didn’t ever feel objectified by him.I’m sure he would have an opinion! I don’t think he would have appreciated his song being in a commercial. But he’s not here. He should have left a will of what he wanted.He came in one time on my birthday. I was like,  You could always hear him walking through the courtyard because he had those high-heeled boots and he had a certain way of walking. But he was dressed totally different than I had ever seen him: black leather boots, jeans—which he never wore—white t-shirt, and a black leather jacket. We cut a rockabilly song all day long. So we finished up, and I made him a cassette and handed it to him. And he stood there at the door with a little smile on his face and threw the cassette at me and said, “Happy birthday.” And that was my birthday song. I have an unreleased Prince song. To him, that was probably the greatest gift he could have given me—a day in the studio!It was the ’80s, so it was a time of excess. I watched people agonize over a snare sound for days: tune it, change it, this and that. You would spend weeks on tracks, and then you’d spend weeks on overdubs, and then weeks on mixing. He was so different than anybody I ever worked with. Technically I’m not real proud of some of our stuff, because I didn’t have time. I couldn’t “blow the groove.” He’d say, “Peggy, you’re blowing the groove! Come on, let’s get going!” But what happened is, I got tired of focusing on things that didn’t matter. I was like, . [Prince] would just work from start to finish. I always felt his music was really fresh.

"Acknowledging the event’s controversial history, the White Sox pledge that they are “dedicated to advocating for a safe, welcoming ballpark experience for all people and communities”This Thursday (June 13), the Chicago White Sox are giving away 10,000 t-shirts to commemorate the 40th anniversary of Disco Demolition Night, Chicago journalist Robert Feder notes. Written on the t-shirt is: “The Night That Records Were Broken.” The shirt is available as part of the team’s Free T-Shirt Thursdays promotion. According to Feder, Steve Dahl, the radio jockey who stirred up anti-disco sentiment by destroying records, will throw out the game’s honorary first pitch.On July 12, 1979, station reps for Chicago’s WLUP and the White Sox teamed up to host Disco Demolition Night, a promotional event that offered 98-cent admission to a doubleheader for anybody who brought a disco record. Dahl was appointed to blow up all the records in centerfield at Comiskey Park between games. Once he did, fans rioted and charged the field.Musicians from the era have condemned the event. “It felt to us like Nazi book-burning,” Nile Rodgers has said. “This is America, the home of jazz and rock and people were now afraid even to say the word ‘disco.’ I remember thinking—we’re not even a disco group.” NPR has written that Disco Demolition Night has come “to be seen as a not-so-subtle attack against disco’s early adopters: blacks, Latinos and gay people.”When contacted by Pitchfork, a representative for the Chicago White Sox sent the following statement:This year’s Disco Demolition T-Shirt giveaway was intended to
recognize the anniversary of a historic off-the-field moment that has
been connected to the organization over the past 40 years. It is a

aware of comments criticizing the T-Shirt giveaway and are in the
process of reviewing feedback. We have been communicating with our

experience for all people and communities, and will continue to engage
in important, informative discussions with our fans and partners to

"Dr. John left this world on June 6, 2019 as a paragon of American musical authenticity, but for a good portion of his 60-year career, purity seemed a secondary consideration. The pianist born Mac Rebennack wasn’t interested in merely keeping the old ways alive, he wanted them to grow and expand. Rebennack borrowed and built upon the work of other musicians, underscoring the rich, complicated musical heritage of his hometown of New Orleans but also slyly weaving new sounds into the Crescent City’s heady brew of jazz, blues, and rock’n’roll. His own innovations of incorporating psychedelia and slick funk into New Orleans music became part of the Big Easy tradition, which eventually gave him the air of an elder statesman—an ambassador, even. It was enough to convey an air of respectability for a musician who, like so many great American artists, came from disreputable beginnings.The very creation of the Dr. John persona was a bit of a ruse. Rebennack thought up the hippie voodoo priest character alongside producer and pianist Harold Battiste, while the pair were playing high-profile session gigs in the late 1960s. Neither expected Rebennack to step into the role: Dr. John was made with Mac’s old high school pal Ronnie Barron in mind, but Barron couldn’t free himself from a record contract. For once, Rebennack and Barron found a constraint they couldn’t conquer. Growing up in New Orleans, they treated laws and conventions as mere suggestions.Barron and Rebennack cut their teeth in the greasy clubs and strip joints that littered New Orleans in the 1950s, releasing a few singles under a variety of names. One of those monikers, Ronnie & the Delinquents, summed up the duo’s degenerate ways—a lifestyle that led to Rebennack severely injuring his left ring finger in a pistol accident while protecting Ronnie in a 1961 fight. Undaunted, Mac swapped his guitar for the piano. He played recording sessions all day and bars all night, worked as a talent scout for the Mississippi label Ace Records, and nursed a heroin addiction all the while. His taste for dope led him to prison and once his time ended in 1965, he jetted out to Los Angeles, where he resumed playing sessions.Among the records graced by Rebennack’s presence were several sides by Sonny & Cher. The Hollywood duo were hip enough to make Battiste their musical director—a sign of how even mainstream stars were seeking to broaden their horizons in the late ’60s—but the producer had his designs on more far out sounds. When it came time to record 1968’s , Rebennack and Battiste drew upon the traditions and myths of New Orleans—the one American city where African, European, and Native North American cultures intermingle in a meaningful way—while also embracing the psychedelia emerging from the rock’n’roll underground. Billed to Dr. John, The Night Tripper (an extended appellation riffing on the slang for acid-assisted voyages),  sounds funky and free in a way that no other mind-bending LP of the era does. The album seems conjured as much as created. is coated in murk and doused in echo, so the voices of Rebennack and his fellow NOLA natives sound spectral, particularly as they intertwine with the record’s baroque arrangements of carnival rhythms. Even when  gets properly swampy, as it does on the slinky “Mama Roux,” the album seems to hang suspended—a spaciness that found its share of acolytes both at the time and in the decades since. It’s no accident that Spirtualized’s Jason Pierce invited Dr. John to play on “Cop Shoot Cop…,” the cataclysmic closer from 1997’s :  invented this kind of jazz-psychedelic freak-out. It’s such a transcendent album, it stands apart from the rest of Dr. John’s catalog, even if it set the stage for everything to come.Rebennack may have quickly ditched the “Night Tripper” credential tacked onto his stage name, but he stuck with that persona for a while longer, wringing out all of its possibilities over the course of three more albums. While none of them could match the eerie charms of , 1969’s expansive  and 1970’s evocative  are both beguiling, particularly compared to the relatively straightforward records delivered in their wake. Encouraged by ATCO’s Jerry Wexler to return to his New Orleans roots, Rebennack cooked up 1972’s , a collection of slick, savvy renditions of Crescent City standards. The tunes are familiar, which makes it possible to hear the humor and carnality within Dr. John’s signature style. These same elements were accentuated when Allen Toussaint, a NOLA mainstay who was in the midst of a renaissance as a producer and songwriter, paired the pianist with the Meters for a sublimely funky LP, 1973’s . Its lead single, “Right Place, Wrong Time,” gave Dr. John his only pop hit, but it turned into a radio perennial, opening the door to television cameos and festival appearances, elevating his stardom along the way.Any career that spans decades is bound to see some smoothing around the edges, and that’s true of Dr. John, too. , a 1989 LP where he rambled his way through the Great American Songbook, earned him the first of his six Grammys. Those accolades often coincided with Rebennack settling into a cozy groove in the studio, cutting tributes to his hometown and its iconic musicians. He also embraced playing for kids, recording a children’s album in 1992 and heeding Disney’s call whenever they needed a dose of easy, earthy boogie. He covered “Cruella De Vil” for the 1996 live-action remake of , performed a similar task for “Bare Necessities” and  20 years later, and sang Randy Newman's “Down in New Orleans” for , a nominee for Best Original Song at the 2009 Oscars. How strange it was to be Dr. John.Rebennack’s roll may have slowed in his later years, but he never stopped exploring the outer limits of sound or embracing younger musicians. Certainly he helped cultivate generations of subsequent New Orleans players—the city is very conscious of passing the torch, something that was evident in Kermit Ruffins’ organization of a second line parade in Dr. John’s honor—but he also occasionally collaborated with newer rockers who remained enthralled by . There was 1998’s , the album that united him with a bunch of Britpop hotshots, including Supergrass, Primal Scream’s Martin Duffy, and Paul Weller. Chief Black Key Dan Auerbach brought Dr. John even closer to the pianist's mystifying origins with , a 2012 album that revived the spirit of the Night Tripper without abandoning the musical gravity Rebennack had earned in the decades since . offered a reminder that Dr. John operated in several dimensions simultaneously. He may have kept the spirit of New Orleans alive but he was no mere revivalist. He wanted the musical traditions there to mutate, in part, because he knew change was necessary for survival. There is no better testament to this truth than Rebennack’s own twist on the Crescent City’s patented rhumba and roll. Time and time again, Dr. John demonstrated just how flexible and infinite New Orleans music could be.",articles4,"['Dr. John', 'Sonny & Cher', 'The Hollywood', 'The Night Tripper', 'Rebennack', 'NOLA', 'Dr. John’s', 'Dr. John’s', 'Allen Toussaint', 'NOLA', 'Rebennack', 'Disney’s', 'Dr. John’s', 'Supergrass', 'Primal Scream', 'Martin Duffy', 'Dr. John', 'Dr. John']"

three hours down there. Yeah, legal death was 45 minutes. My toe was
tagged and they were pushing me in the drawer and I looked both ways
and I saw frozen people to the left and frozen people to the right.
I’m like, “I must be dreaming,” then I looked in front of me and I saw
a door about to close and the people are still pushing me and I was
like, “YO!”And everybody stopped. I was like, “Hey, I have to pee.” They pulled
the drawer out, I sat up, pulled the catheter out, jumped down, and
the security for the morgue... the actual mortician ran out, whoever
the people are in the morgue part of the hospital, he ran out and
dropped his glasses. The security dude stood there and I jumped down
and I was like, “I have to pee.” I peed, and I ended up peeing on his
leg, and he took off running. He’s like, “He’s alive, somebody come

"After news spread on Sunday that the iconic Houston rapper had died after being diagnosed with cancer, his family confirmed reports were falseUpdate: June 10, 7:30 a.m. Eastern: Bushwick Bill died Sunday evening, his publicist has confirmed.Update: June 9, 1:32 p.m. Eastern: After reports spread about the death of Bushwick Bill, the rapper’s son released a statement on Instagram confirming that the Geto Boys icon is still alive. “My dad IS NOT dead, he’s still alive and fighting for his life,” he wrote. “He needs your continued prayers and support. Certain people have been so quick to write him off as dead so they can capitalize off it, and it’s messed up because y’all really think these people care about him. There is no Geto Boys without Bushwick Bill.”Earlier today, Bushwick Bill—one of the founding members of the iconic Houston rap group Geto Boys—was reported dead at age 52 after Geto Boys’ Scarface confirmed the news in a since-deleted Instagram post. TMZ subsequently changed their initial report, noting that Bill’s representative said that the rapper was still alive and fighting in the hospital. In February 2019, Bushwick Bill was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer and underwent intensive chemotherapy.A Geto Boys farewell tour was announced and subsequently scrapped. Bushwick Bill was reportedly upset with the title of the tour (“The Beginning of a Long Goodbye: The Final Farewell”) because it “made it seem like he was on his deathbed.”

"Listen to the track belowWhen the term “quiet storm” was coined in the mid-’70s, it signified a particular brand of sensuous R&B infused with smooth jazz. Encompassing the likes of Luther Vandross, Anita Baker, Sade, and others, the genre translated into a radio format for older listeners who were more likely to hold a more sophisticated understanding of romance—as opposed to a flighty and inexperienced sense of “teen love.” But even though she’s only 23 years old, New York artist Amber Mark proves that she can recreate quiet storm’s magic on “What If,” by replicating the genre’s richness in both sound and emotion.The little details in the track’s production are what make “What If” carry the same sumptuousness of an impeccably embellished slow jam. The song is introduced by a sweeping string arrangement that seems to flutter in mid-air until it’s balanced out by a perfect groove, established by a funk bass, light strums of an acoustic guitar, and flourishes of a distant, new age-y synth. To match the arrangement’s complexity, Mark shares some equally deep musings about love and relationships; “If I never felt heartbreak at all.../Tell me how would I know if it’s love,” she sings, her voice light and breathy. She’s rehashing an age-old sentiment: You have to know pain to understand true happiness. But through the subtleties of her inflection and production, Amber Mark elegantly dresses it up in new shiny satin clothes.",articles4,"['Luther Vandross', 'Anita Baker', 'Amber Mark', 'Amber Mark']"

"Listen to the track belowIn 2017, Charli XCX joked that she was the newest member of BTS. It seemed feasible enough. She knows her way around a candy-coated melody, and she understands how to hit a musical bliss point. And she’s no stranger to the world of K-pop; earlier this year, she wrote a song for the twee idol group Twice, and boy-band cast-off turned Roc Nation rapper Jay Park closed ’s “Unlock It.” As if making good on a promise, Charli appears alongside BTS officially for “Dream Glow,” the first song from the  soundtrack for a mobile game of the same name. There are few things more K-pop than using music as advertising for an app, but the song’s light bop is nearly pessimist-proof.“Dream Glow” repurposes a 2016 Charli XCX demo produced by StarGate, flipping an irradiant come-on into a twinkling reverie. Though billed to BTS, the song only features three of the group’s four singers—Jimin, Jin, and Jungkook—and none of its rappers. They don’t miss a beat, with Charli filling the vacant spaces to maintain their carefully arranged synchronicity. She beams through with re-recorded vocals and new lyrics, and the boys swirl around her. Their performances are like decorative icing carefully applied around the edges of a cake, layer within layer of lithe coos. They sing vaguely but assuredly, in English and Korean, about the yet-to-be-realized potential of dreams. It’s starry-eyed but not fanciful. “Dream Glow” forgoes the bubblegum pop neverland of their Halsey collab, “Boy With Luv,” for pristine EDM-lite delight. With Charli XCX as an honorary member, an undermanned BTS squad turn a forgotten leftover into a sweet lullaby for their ARMY idealists.",articles4,"['Twice', 'Roc Nation', 'Jay Park']"

A longtime fan, Auerbach sought out the singer-songwriter in order to make a record with him. Eventually, the Black Keys co-founder would go on to produce and play guitar on Dr. John’s penultimate album, Locked Down.“Every song was like a performance; he just went for it. He loved the music, and he wasn’t looking for perfection; he was just grooving,” Auerbach says. “All the stars aligned. Some of the songs held a lot of deep meaning for him personally. It seemed it took a lot of weight off his shoulders. He was a little lighter after he sang those songs. Afterward he thanked me and just said it really helped bring his family together.”Auerbach continued, “He was so one of a kind...

I listened carefully to my mother’s argument that if something is deserved then one must be gracious in acceptance. So, as a good lad, who likes to do what will make his Mam most proud, I knew that I must put old doubts and enmities aside and muster what little grace I possess.”“To be honest,” Costello added, “I’m pretty tickled to receive this acknowledgement for my ‘Services To Music,’ as it confirms my long held suspicion nobody really listens to the words in songs or the outcome might have been somewhat different.” Read his full letter here.Elvis Costello released Look Now, his latest album with the Imposters, in 2018.Read “An Ode to Elvis Costello’s Stellar Backing Bands, the Attractions and the Imposters” over on the Pitch.",articles4,"['’”Costello', 'Elvis Costello', 'Imposters']"

"Listen to the track belowValerie Teicher, aka Tei Shi, traffics in lush music that glides between featherlight electronic-pop and moony ballads. On 2017’s , Teicher veered toward big synth pop songs to frame her development as an artist, splicing in samples of her childhood voice recorded on a tape deck to sweetly and effectively illustrate her past and present personalities in conversation. On “A Kiss Goodbye,” the first taste of her forthcoming follow-up, Teicher seems to have fully stepped into her own, brewing up a relaxed bossa nova confection centered on trusting your own intuition instead of someone else.“A Kiss Goodbye” drifts by on a laid-back clave rhythm, glowing background synths, and Teicher’s bright, lilting falsetto. The sunny vibe buoys her lyrics, which find Teicher recuperating from a breakup and deciding to trust in herself in the future. At the bridge, the sumptuous instrumentation drops out in favor of an echoing synth line, reverberating as if underwater and anchoring her newfound sense of focus: “The love that I have in this heart of mine,” she coos, “I’m keeping it all to myself this time.” In Teicher’s hands, that useful mantra of self-reliance sounds like total bliss.",articles4,['Tei Shi']
"Listen to the track belowMaybe the only heartbreak more gutting than a clean, effective-immediately split is one that  trickles to a full stop. At least, that’s the grief Whitney exude in “Giving Up,” the latest single from the Chicago duo’s forthcoming album . Julien Ehrlich and Max Kakacek have a knack for lacing their sunny, easygoing melodies with woeful lyrics; “Giving Up” cruises in with a dainty, folksy piano, but the track’s spirit is far more dim.“Are you coming home, my love?/Tears are falling one by one/I can feel you giving up,” Ehrlich sings, aware the relationship is fizzling out. But his partner’s looming disinterest is even more excruciating in its one-sidedness, and there’s an air of self-blame to his mourning. “Though we started losing touch/I’ve been hangin’ on because/You’re the only one I love,” he reflects. There aren’t many lyrics in “Giving Up”—a rich, swinging trumpet solo assumes the place of a bridge—but even these few words still invoke the stomach-drop realization that something once great is headed towards a dead end.",articles4,"['“Are', 'Ehrlich']"

"Record labels helped kill the band Failure. After delivering their third album, 1996’s , to Slash Records, the alt-rockers found themselves stuck in an 18-month purgatory of label changes, unsure when or if the album would be released. So when Failure returned to playing shows in 2014, they wanted to avoid a traditional label arrangement. They turned instead to PledgeMusic, the 10-year-old UK company that served as a combination fundraising and retail portal for musicians at all stages of their careers. A campaign for Failure’s comeback, 2015’s , netted the band $200,000—the first time that its members had actually seen profits from album sales. Thus began a profitable relationship with the platform, which now owes Failure about $70,000 from their third campaign, according to frontman Ken Andrews.“[Labels] control your fate on a level that is just draconian,” he said. “We thought we were done with that and it literally feels like they tracked us down. And when I say ‘us’ I don’t mean just my band, I mean all these bands who were on majors or had some form of a career within the normal music industry, who then extricated themselves and were doing this direct-to-fan, homegrown thing.”When PledgeMusic founder Benji Rogers announced in a May 8th Medium post that the company would be entering bankruptcy, it was an unwelcome but not unexpected announcement. Slow payments had been an issue for a year, top executives departed, and Rogers returned to PledgeMusic on a volunteer basis to help seek a buyer. Former employees allege that PledgeMusic used funds collected on artist campaigns to cover operating expenses and have questioned whether that was done at the direction of its board, whose members include Joshua Sason, recently charged with fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and former Columbia Records president Don Ienner, who was implicated in payola inquiries in the mid-2000s. (Rogers told Pitchfork that he can’t comment on behalf of PledgeMusic, while reps for the company did not respond to requests.)The outstanding amount owed to artists is estimated at being anywhere from $1 to $3 million at the low end, with some owed hundreds of thousands of dollars. Artists who have made statements about their losses include Jesus Jones (between $5-10,000), Fastball ($11,000), the Dandy Warhols ($50,000), and L7 (“at least” $75,000). What these veteran artists have in common is that, like Failure, they turned to PledgeMusic as a way to forgo the traditional middlemen of the industry—and the perils of exploitative contracts, bankrupt distributors, and retail upheaval. Ultimately, their fates were still subject to corporate mismanagement.PledgeMusic was great for the kinds of bands Andrews calls “blue collar”: able to make enough from album and merch sales plus touring to make it worthwhile, as long as they carefully accounted for every dollar. Their core fanbase might number in the four figures, but diehards would put up $275 for handwritten lyrics, $400 for an online drum lesson or $3,800 for a tour of a band's hometown. Semisonic, the Presidents of the United States of America, and Lit—all one- or two-hit wonders from the ’90s, at least in the eyes of general audiences—blew past their fundraising goals for reissues and recent recordings alike. On PledgeMusic, bands that were decades removed from their best sellers could revel in the passion of their biggest fans and gauge how much new music was worth to them. Just as crucially, the musicians could keep track of the money themselves—or so they thought.“I've had all kinds of trials and tribulations with business managers and people stealing from me constantly,” said Filter frontman Richard Patrick, who was in the midst of his second PledgeMusic campaign, following a successful fundraiser in 2016. “And now finally, I find this great little site that puts me in touch directly with people who want to hang out online, and lo and behold, someone’s gonna fuck that up too.”Initially reluctant to try it, Patrick was soon won over by the fun of interacting with his fans (“You knew these fans really cared, so it made for this incredible bond with them,” he said). When PledgeMusic announced its closure last month, the industrial rock band had nearly 1,200 outstanding pledges for their new album, which reunites Patrick with original Filter member Brian Liesegang. Patrick says he is owed “tens of thousands” of dollars, but he intends to move forward with the release. “If it's the last thing I ever do, I’m going to make sure that I fulfill everything that was requested of me by the fans,” he added.Dan Stuart, the founder of Tucson’s pioneering pre-Americana group Green on Red, launched a PledgeMusic campaign at the urging of his label, Cadiz Music, to help sell a solo album and a novel. While Cadiz paid for the manufacturing costs and fulfilled all the orders, Stuart had an agreement in place with the recording studio and the graphic designers who worked on his projects: they’d get paid when he got his cut of the PledgeMusic sales. Now he’s got to figure out how to pay them out of pocket.Stuart compares PledgeMusic with Jem Records, the distributor whose 1988 bankruptcy was disastrous for independent labels and artists. “Jem used to pay just the big clients, so if something was really selling they would pay the bill because they’d want more to keep selling. If it wasn’t such a big client they’d ignore you or not pay you.”Cadiz Music owner Richard England had used PledgeMusic for years; it was a good retail option because it could reach a large audience. Aside from Stuart’s album, England is owed money on campaigns for documentaries about the Slits and Madness singer Suggs, for a total of around £30,000 ($37,955). “At the beginning of last year, I would have forecast turning over maybe £100,000 ($126,517) worth of business with them,” England said. “I was certainly not expecting them to steal our money and go into administration [bankruptcy in the UK].”For England, the PledgeMusic bankruptcy is just the most recent time a larger company collected money from the sale of products he paid to make, spent that money, then went out of business, effectively leaving him with the bill. The bankruptcy of Cadiz’s main distributor, Pinnacle Entertainment, in 2008 was a similarly unexpected and catastrophic experience, England says, as was last year’s collapse of music retailer HMV. England has taken out a £40,000 ($50,607) personal loan in order to meet his obligations. “I thought we’d be more insulated or protected against these things in this day and age, but we don’t seem to be,” he said. “It just seems to be the same, really.”Ken Andrews says that without the money Failure is owed by PledgeMusic, the band can’t fulfill the orders for their fifth album, due to the hefty shipping costs of heavy vinyl packages.

"Listen to the track belowMany of Róisín Murphy’s best songs hinge upon a single word—“Jealousy,” “Simulation,” “Overpowered”—terse incantations wrung for every iota of their potency. On “Incapable,” the Irish singer invokes a particularly loaded term, singing from the perspective of a woman estranged from the very ability to love.It’s a sneaky tune. At first, it sounds celebratory: “Never had a broken heart,” she admits, as her longtime accomplice Richard Barratt (aka Crooked Man) threads a hypnotic deep-house groove with slinky hints of disco. It sounds like a boast; her voice is somewhere between blasé and bulletproof. But as the song builds, and she contemplates her curious, almost inhuman remove, her tone turns searching, then desperate. With the chorus, she cuts to the chase: “Never had a broken heart/Am I incapable of love?/Never had a broken heart/Yet I’m unavailable for love.”Murphy has always had an enviable expressive range, but here she really leans into it, seesawing between breezy nonchalance and bluesy hurt, between a whisper and a growl. For a song about inner turmoil, “Incapable” is strikingly smooth. It glides on for more than eight minutes, disco riffs tracing delicate circles in the air as the synths rise higher and higher. Like the best dance music, it’s an invitation to get lost—only here, it seeks catharsis in the shadow of another’s emotional failure.",articles4,['Róisín Murphy']

"A little over two years ago, in a bougie hotel lounge in lower Manhattan, Father John Misty talked at me for nearly four hours. We discussed God, living online vs. offline, and his issues with Pitchfork, but my favorite part was when we sparred over the pop industrial complex. I asked him if he likes pop music, since he’d recently done co-writes on Beyoncé’s Lemonade and Lady Gaga’s ; he asked me what “like” means, exactly, before offering up a series of “insights” about the true mental state of pop stars. As much as I hate to give Misty the satisfaction, I have often thought of his claims, particularly this one:If you think that pop stars are anything other than prisoners, then
you are fucking kidding yourself. I know them. They are crying for
help in their music. We think that we’re doing the world a favor by
recognizing the innate wholesomeness of this form of music, like, “Oh,
I don’t know, it’s just fun! Something that was made to be liked!”
But why do you think that Lady Gaga or Beyoncé would come to old Uncle
Jerry over here for songs if they weren’t looking for something? If
they weren’t like, “Get me away from these fucking psychos.”I was reminded of this quote again last night while watching the newly released fifth season of “Black Mirror,” the hit sci-fi drama that uses technological hyperbole to suggest depressing truths about society. In an episode called “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,” Charlie Brooker’s anthology series takes on the pop industrial complex. Miley Cyrus stars as a hyper-commercialized singer named Ashley O, whose retail empire of blandly affirmative bubblegum hits expands to include a foot-tall AI robot implanted with her personality. Offstage, it becomes clear that 24-year-old Ashley is essentially a prisoner of her evil auntager (aunt + manager), a greedy team of execs, and the expectations of her enormous fanbase. She begins crying out for help in her music, writing a song about caged animals on her big white “Imagine” piano while the sun rises over her Malibu complex. Later in the episode, it’s made painfully clear that she is a literal prisoner trying to get away from these fucking psychos, as Father John Misty insisted. To reverse this, the episode jumps the shark in an outrageous and implausible way, as “Black Mirror” is wont to do.As an episode of a series that alternately scares the shit out of me and makes me cringe, I found “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too” par for the course. I could empathize with the episode’s parallel plotline of a young Ashley fan who, having just lost her mother and moved to a new town, takes solace in an Ashley Too doll; first I was happy she found an AI robot to confide in, then ultimately unsettled, which felt like the clear goal. There are some killer one-liners from Ashley’s auntager, who embodies all the money-hungry, image-conscious cynicism of top-level music managers (my favorite: “She’s Ashley O, not Leonard fucking Cohen”). In the final scenes of the episode, when Ashley’s full personality comes to the fore in an Ashley Too gone rogue, Cyrus’ voiceover performance is amusingly aggrieved. It sounds three-dimensional for the first time, like the real Cyrus was desperate to be after her initial rise as Hannah Montana—perhaps because some of her own experiences inspired the episode. “It was a great collaboration [with the director and show runners], but there is a part of Ashley O that is not a character,” she told the . When asked if the episode’s world was familiar to her, she responded, “Eerily so.”With all due respect to what Miley went through, particularly as she shifted from a walking Disney Channel franchise to a drug-taking wild child, “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too” makes as tired and rockist an argument as Father John Misty did to me. Both oversimplify and underestimate the current state of the pop industry, which from my view, is mostly trying to keep up with a younger generation of stars who’ve done away with old notions about genre and don’t necessarily see a rigid divide between the underground and the mainstream (think Billie Eilish). As for the more veteran stars leading the pack, they’ve fought hard for their autonomy as they’ve built their empires. Beyoncé, Gaga, and Cyrus herself all came of age in the deeply flawed major-label system and were forced to release formulaic pap at one point or another, but they’ve pushed past that with more musical risks and personal material (some more adeptly than others). They don’t exactly need “saving,” as the episode and Misty suggest.As the episode credits roll, Ashley is reinvented as an angsty rocker, covering Nine Inch Nails’ “Head Like a Hole.” The idea is, apparently, that in embracing rock, she finds her freedom. In her automaton pop days, Ashley sang a chirpy, farcical version of the intensely cathartic song about fighting to maintain control (“Hey there, whoah-ho, I’m on a roll/Riding so high, achieving my goals/I’m so stoked on ambition and verve/I’m gonna get what I deserve,” went the chorus). Trent Reznor gave his blessing for this, according to Brooker, and “got it straight away.” He would. No stranger to the pop machine, the NIN leader went from outcast to poster boy as his tortured songs broached the mainstream during the ’90s alternative boom. He seemingly railed against the commercial trap set for him in later songs like “Right Where It Belongs,” the track Ashley “writes” early in the episode as a cry for help. As he proves, no artist of any genre is immune to the music industry trying to co-opt and monetize a sound they hear dollar signs in. Certainly young, burgeoning Top 40 stars are particularly vulnerable to exploitation, and the sexism and opportunism around them runs rampant, but “Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too” only succeeds if it convinces you that a pop star is still the ultimate damsel in distress. And thankfully, that mirror is distorting reality.",articles4,"['Manhattan', 'Pitchfork', 'Lady Gaga’s', '! Something', 'Beyoncé', 'Uncle\nJerry', 'Eerily', '”With', 'Disney Channel']"

"Listen to the track belowThe DJ edit is a cornerstone of house music, one that proves a tricky endeavor for producers to this day. Crafting the perfect edit is something of an alchemical process: Find an excellent groove and boil it down to its most essential sections. Add new elements—fatty kick drums, more BPM, some claps here, a tasty piano trill there—and bring out as much detail as you can using modern-day mix techniques.

Relegated to obscurity until a relatively recent reissue, the 1981 album features the type of horn-driven funk and boogie spearheaded by Earth, Wind & Fire through much of the prior decade. Dan Snaith’s edit takes the main break and punches it up, drawing out the jittery guitars but leaving space for singer June Ventzos’ irresistible refrains.“Sizzling” lists Paradise as a featured artist, rather than shunting them to a mere acknowledgement in the credits, which technically makes this Daphni track—released with the band’s blessing—the first “new” release from Paradise in almost four decades. This demarcation isn’t a charitable decision; Snaith understands that so much of the magic in DJ edits comes from brilliant source material, and that the unsung efforts of bands like Paradise form the ground upon which he stands. “Sizzling” encapsulates what every DJ/producer should aspire to: a dancefloor firestarter that might open listeners to music they never knew they needed.",articles4,"['Daphni’s', 'Earth', 'Wind & Fire']"

"In 2013, nearly 15 years after Chicago journalist Jim DeRogatis and his partner Abdon Pallasch first began reporting on R. Kelly’s alleged crimes against girls and women, he began to sense that something had finally clicked with a mass of readers. An interview he’d given to Jessica Hopper was published in the  that December, alongside disturbing details from his work in the  over the years. The piece wasn’t the first time any of the rape and predation allegations against Kelly were made public, but it was the first time they went viral. Kelly had had something of a year, DeRogatis explains in his new book , headlining Pitchfork Music Festival, playing Bonnaroo and Coachella, and collaborating with Lady Gaga. But in a matter of weeks, that momentum had slowed.The next month, in a  piece of his own, titled “Why Are People Finally Paying Attention to R. Kelly’s Many Crimes?,” DeRogatis described the Hopper interview as “a one-stop shop for the truth about R. Kelly in the age of social media.” Is that why people were finally paying attention, he wondered? Partly yes. It also helped, I think, that Hopper emphasized a specific phrase of DeRogatis’ (which, he admits, he didn’t originate): “The saddest fact I’ve learned is nobody matters less to our society than young black women. Nobody.” That assessment felt like a truism, and it gave the allegations the kind of public framing that actually sticks.These days, the Kelly matter is pretty much closed in the eyes of the public. The January airing of Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly,” a blockbuster, six-part docuseries produced by dream hampton and featuring interviews with dozens of people directly and indirectly aware of his behavior, made concrete the extent of Kelly’s alleged abuse, using DeRogatis’s reporting as something of a roadmap. Shortly afterwards, Kelly was indicted on 10 counts of aggravated sexual assault in Cook County, Illinois; elsewhere, rumors of further investigations sprung up. Last week, a few days before the publication of , Cook County upped those charges to include 11 more felony charges of sexual assault and sexual abuse.The book is more than a straight-forward account of Kelly’s wrongdoing. Structured across three sections that roughly trace the evolution of the public’s view of Kelly,  offers a dogged combination of biography, investigative reporting, and cultural criticism. DeRogatis fills in the past 30 years with details about Kelly’s patterns of behavior, the lives of many of the girls and women he victimized, the publicity and management machine that kept him inoculated from material harm, and the slimy, equivocating justice system that failed its mandate so completely. He is careful to center the stories of his sources, and to contextualize their experiences. He is careful, too, in recalling his unusual proximity to the case: After an unknown person delivered incriminating footage to DeRogatis, he provided police with the video evidence that would launch the state’s messy 2002 case against Kelly; he was compelled to testify at the trial six years later. Also instructive is DeRogatis’ clear-eyed explanation of the many factors, including a biased judge and prosecutorial missteps, that led to Kelly’s acquittal in the face of damning testimony.But in answering so many questions about Kelly, DeRogatis raises plenty more about what it all means. As much as  is an account of Kelly’s misbehavior, it’s a finger firmly pointed in the direction of the people and institutions that enabled, and even encouraged, him. Among them are record execs who feigned ignorance and lawyers who pushed Kelly’s early accusers to accept settlements in exchange for their silence. Members of the media are also to blame. DeRogatis repeats, as if with incredulity, that no outlets followed up on the stories he broke, through public court records and a lot of knocking on doors, with any reporting of their own. And that fact—particularly in light of the media industry’s structural weakening, debates about the value of arts criticism, and cultural attacks on journalism—makes  even more striking. In recent years, DeRogatis has continued what he calls “investigative criticism,” working with BuzzFeed and  on pieces that build on previous reporting and uncover new allegations against Kelly. Reading about the difficulty he had in publishing those stories following his departure from the  in 2010 isn’t necessarily riveting, but DeRogatis’ struggle to get people to care, and invest, in disseminating the truth about R. Kelly has become central to the story.There are some minor missteps: In acknowledging himself as a self-aware outsider, DeRogatis leans a little too heavily on self-deprecation; occasional colloquialisms, like the word “nappy,” used at one point to describe Kelly’s hair, are employed in poor choice; an intriguing but unsubstantiated theory connecting the Nation of Islam to a former manager accused of trying to bring down Kelly winds up being a distracting, fruitless detour. But  manages to get at that central question that I believe helped prompt a reversal of favor for Kelly back in late 2013: Why do some stories connect while others don’t?Earlier this year, I had some tense conversations with friends and acquaintances about why it felt more difficult to accept the accusations against Michael Jackson, outlined in the recent HBO documentary , than those against R. Kelly, and why the level of chatter about both felt mismatched, even though Jackson is clearly the bigger star. There are notable differences, of course: Jackson is not alive;  zooms in on the stories of two survivors and their families; video evidence, like in Kelly’s case, has never been presented; Jackson was alleged to have preyed on young boys, making for a gender dynamic that is more complicated for many people to process. Wrestling with the allegations, the prevailing thinking goes, must mean prescribing what justice should look like and what that means for decades’ worth of notable songs. In reality, we will never erase the musical legacies of people like Kelly and Jackson. But Jim DeRogatis’ work, viewed as a whole for the first time in , challenges us to make sure the truth isn’t erased again.",articles4,"['Kelly’s', 'Lady Gaga', 'The January', 'Kelly’s', 'Cook County', 'Cook County', 'Kelly’s', 'Structured', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s']"

"Chad Focus, whose single “Dance With Me” landed on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart last year, faces up to 20 years in federal prisonChad Arrington is a Baltimore singer who performs and records under the name Chad Focus. While Arrington isn’t a household name in the music world, his song “Dance With Me” landed on Billboard’s Dance Club Songs chart last year and received a T-Pain remix. He also appeared in an enormous Times Square billboard (below), which advertised both his real name and his Chad Focus project.On May 29, a federal grand jury indicted Arrington in connection with allegations that he used a company credit card to make over $4.1 million in unauthorized purchases—many directly connected to his music career. He faces federal charges of conspiracy, wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft. If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.The indictment, unsealed today and viewed by Pitchfork, claims that while Arrington was employed as an SEO specialist at an unnamed company, he and four unnamed co-conspirators used a company-issued American Express card to spend millions in fraudulent purchases. Between January 2015 and August 2018, Arrington allegedly used company money to promote his music, purchase audio equipment, artificially increase plays on Spotify and other streaming services, purchase followers and views for his social media platforms, and yes, purchase Chad Focus billboards throughout the country.https://twitter.com/_alexweinberg/status/1052696820554567685?s=19Arrington also allegedly spent more than $250,000 on the company credit card in purchases related to a bike-sharing business. The indictment claims that the credit card was also used for concert tickets, travel, and other nightlife expenses. Arrington and his co-conspirators also face allegations of funneling payments to one another.Arrington and two of his co-conspirators are accused of concealing the crime by falsifying credit card statements submitted to the company. Arrington is accused of forging a supervisor’s signature multiple times to make it appear that he had permission to make those purchases. He allegedly sent those false authorizations to other employees at the company, and the credit card balance was subsequently paid off by the company.Pitchfork has reached out to Arrington’s representatives.",articles4,"['Focus', 'Focus', 'T-Pain', 'Spotify']"

On “Gretel,” his first track since 2017’s  and the first single off his forthcoming album , it’s hard not to read those titles as a reference to the Grimms’ fairytale of greed gone astray, with Alex G serving as a narrator desperately clinging to the straight and narrow. “Nobody’s gonna push me off track,” he sings, deadly serious.“Gretel” also marks a return to the style of his earlier recordings for the Philadelphia artist, dominated by an acoustic guitar and backgrounded with a metallic piano that recalls an organ. Whereas much of  felt like it was trying to create distance with Auto-Tuned vocal processing and reverberating synthesizers, there is an intimacy to the finger-picked progression in the bridge, the swirling strings that accent the song’s final third. But “Gretel” still features the hypnotic circuitousness that unites his songwriting, a deceptive gentleness in the way the warbled, pitched-up vocals of the intro return in the fading coda. Paired with the paranoiac repetitions in his lyrics, it seems ready to unravel at any moment.",articles4,"['Sandy', 'Alex G', 'Alex G', 'Paired']"
"Meek and his legal team are hoping to vacate the 2008 conviction that has landed him back in jail several timesMeek Mill has been granted a new hearing in a new court in his ongoing legal situation, local NBC affiliate WCAU reports and Pitchfork can confirm. The appellate court hearing will take place at the Superior Court of Pennsylvania on Tuesday, July 16. Significantly, Meek’s lawyers will make their arguments in front of a judge other than Philadelphia Common Pleas Judge Genece Brinkley, who sentenced Meek to prison in 2017 and also denied him a new trial following his April 2018 release from prison.“We’re looking forward to the oral argument before the Superior Court of Pennsylvania and to, hopefully, having Meek’s conviction vacated,” Meek Mill’s lawyer Jordan Siev said in a statement. “In light of the District Attorney’s recent filing, where he supports the granting of a new trial to Meek and the recusal of Judge Brinkley, we hope to have this injustice rectified once and for all.”Meek Mill’s legal troubles stem from a 2008 conviction on drug and gun charges that he and his legal team are still trying to have vacated. Meek spent time in jail in 2009 following the conviction and has returned to jail multiple times for probation violations.Among his lawyers’ arguments for vacating is that Reginald Graham, the officer who arrested Meek in 2007, could not be considered a credible witness and allegedly gave false testimony during Meek’s initial trial. In addition, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner has pointed to a “public perception of unfairness and bias” surrounding Judge Brinkley, who has refused to recuse herself from the case despite allegations of overstepping her duties as a judge.Revisit “Why Did Meek Mill Go to Prison?” on the Pitch.",articles4,"['Tuesday', 'Meek’s', 'Meek’s', 'District Attorney’s', 'Meek’s']"

"When Bon Iver returned from a half-decade hiatus with , Barack Obama was still the president of the United States and the Chicago Cubs had not won a World Series in over a century. Needless to say, a lot has changed since then. Over the past three years, Justin Vernon has started a duo project with the National’s Aaron Dessner, composed music for a modern dance piece, hosted two different festivals, and much more. The man simply doesn’t rest.Now that new Bon Iver music is on the horizon—the project returned this week with two tracks and extended tour dates—it’s a good time to revisit what Vernon’s been up to (aside from touring) since  dropped.October 1-2, 2016: In the days following the release of , Vernon and the Dessners decamp to the Funkhaus complex in Berlin, partnering with the nearby Michelberger Hotel to hold the first, then-unnamed edition of what would eventually become their PEOPLE Festival. Hosting over 80 artists—including Damien Rice, Erlend Øye, Fionn Regan, Boys Noize, and more—the two-day event saw the artists collaborate and deliver a slew of different performances. (Read more about the festival in our feature on it.)At one point, Vernon sits down with a randomly selected fan to serenade them with “8 (circle),” a performance that was captured by La Blogothèque and released in 2016 as part of their “One to One” series.October 27, 2016: In early September 2016, Vernon gathers over two dozen journalists at a small hotel in his hometown of Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to play  and answer questions. A month after the album’s release, he shares the full video recording of that press conference on YouTube, which shows him fielding questions about the album’s inception and prevailing philosophy.November 15, 2016: Though reticent to show his face during the  press cycle, Vernon makes a rare appearance in the PBS documentary series “Soundbreaking,” a show focusing on telling the stories behind iconic recordings. Vernon revisits some of the old Pro Tools sessions for songs off  and .July 2017: In keeping with the collaborative spirit of the PEOPLE Festival, Vernon is seemingly everywhere during the summer of 2017, popping up to cover Prince’s “Erotic City” alongside the Revolution (!) in Minneapolis and singing in a Bill Withers cover band supergroup with Hiss Golden Messenger and Natalie Prass just days later at the Newport Folk Festival. During John Prine’s headlining set, which closed out Newport, Vernon joins the ranks of Roger Waters, Margo Price, and others to help sing Prine’s 1971 classic “Paradise.”January 29, 2018: The 60th annual Grammy Awards come and go, with Bruno Mars sweeping Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and more. Vernon is less than pleased (we weren’t exactly thrilled, either). “Looks like Grammies are still something serious musicians should not take seriously! Absolutely NO offense to Mr Mars, but you absolutely have to be shitting me,” he tweets, later going on to highlight other artists like Kendrick Lamar and SZA. “I’d say move on from this shit show.”March 25, 2018: “Come Through,” a two-night performance series, debuts at MASS MoCa in North Adams, Massachusetts. The collaboration between Vernon and the Minnesota-based contemporary dance group TU Dance features a “work-in-progress score” commissioned by the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra’s Liquid Music Series.June 6, 2018: PEOPLE—now an artist collective in addition to a festival—previews a digital platform that will host the group’s content. This beta version of the site teases two new Vernon songs with great titles: “Shittiest Day in American History” and “Thoughts on People 1.” There’s also four new songs from Big Red Machine, the collaborative project between Vernon and Aaron Dessner, and unreleased music from other PEOPLE members.June 23, 2018: Vernon appears with Dead & Company at a show in East Troy, Wisconsin. He joins the band for “Bird Song,” “Friend of the Devil,” and “Black Muddy River” and shreds with John Mayer.July 6-7, 2018: The fourth iteration of Vernon and Aaron Dessner’s Eaux Claires festival has a twist: the lineup isn’t announced until the gates of the fest open. The bill ends up featuring a bunch of collaborative jam sessions from frequent Vernon cohorts, including (naturally) the National, Sharon Van Etten, Julien Baker, and Phil Cook. The response was mixed, with many attendees feeling that the mysterious buildup left them underwhelmed.August 29, 2018: Vernon releases a song called “Agasteen” via his PEOPLE platform. The track is “a long piece of music that seems to relax me,” Vernon says on Twitter.August 31, 2018: Vernon joins Eminem on “Fall,” a song off the rapper’s . The track features Eminem dissing copycat rappers and attacking Tyler, the Creator with a homophobic slur. Vernon addresses the song on Twitter: “Was not in the studio for the Eminem track. Came from a session with BJ Burton and Mike Will. Not a fan of the message, it’s tired. Asked them to change the track, wouldn’t do it.” He adds, “we are gonna kill this track,” though it is unclear what that means since Vernon remains on the song.August 31, 2018: That same day, Big Red Machine releases its self-titled debut. Featuring songs originally previewed on the PEOPLE platform,  is a sprawling collection of genre-defying abstractions. Vernon’s lyrics veer dangerously close to beat poetry: “We met up like a ski team/Well we rose up outta G-League/In a Teepee gloss/Where your tea leaves, boss?”November 16, 2018: Bon Iver appears on the  soundtrack with a new, Mike WiLL Made-It-produced song called “Do You Need Power? (Walk Out Music).”December 11, 2018: For the first time since its 2015 founding, the Eaux Claires festival announces that it will take a year off in 2019 before returning in 2020. “While it will be hard for us to break the chain of momentum and the positive impact the festival has had on our community, we have fresh, clear ideas of how to make it better,” reads a statement on the festival’s site. “We want to celebrate EVEN MORE about this REAL TOWN we call home by extolling and imagining things we haven’t seen or experienced to date.”March 21, 2019: Vernon co-writes and sings on “Cast-Off,” a song from pianist Bruce Hornsby’s record . His valiant efforts to usher in the Hornsbyssance only continue.May 3, 2019: The PEOPLE Festival (now dubbed 37d03d Festival) touches down at Brooklyn’s Pioneer Works, where Vernon and the Dessner brothers perform, along with Boys Noize, Anaïs Mitchell, and more. Vernon performs a full set of Bob Dylan covers, including “All Along the Watchtower” and “Angelina.”June 3, 2019: During a set at London’s All Points East festival, Bon Iver debuts two new songs, “Hey, Ma” and “U (Man Like).” At the end of the performance, a screen directs fans to a website called “icommai,” which lists other collaborators including the National’s Bryce Dessner, Moses Sumney, Bruce Hornsby, and Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner. A press statement elaborates: “This project began with a single person, but throughout the last 11 years, the identity of Bon Iver has bloomed and can only be defined by the faces in the ever-growing family we are.”",articles4,"['Bon Iver', 'Barack Obama', 'Bon Iver', 'Vernon’s', 'Damien Rice', 'Fionn Regan', 'Eau Claire', 'Prince', 'Bill Withers', 'Hiss Golden Messenger', 'Natalie Prass', 'Roger Waters', 'Margo Price', 'Prine’s', 'Bruno Mars', 'Grammies', 'MASS', 'TU Dance', 'Dead & Company', 'Julien Baker', 'Red Machine', 'Bon Iver', '(Walk Out', 'Bruce Hornsby’s', 'Anaïs Mitchell', 'Bon Iver', 'Bon Iver']"

"Listen to the track belowJay Som’s official 2017 debut  was a homespun strain of jangly indie rock and dreamy shoegaze. On “Superbike,” Melina Duterte does away with the closely mic’d intimacies in favor of more expansive lushness, inspired by a retreat she took to Joshua Tree for her upcoming album Anak Ko (“my child” in Tagalog). And while she’s still producing and engineering it all herself, Duterte has invited guest players—including Vagabon’s Laetitia Tamko and past collaborator Justus Proffitt—to record on a Jay Som solo record for the first time.“Superbike” might lack the immediate stickiness of her debut, but it cuts a new and wider path forward. Jay Som’s voice intertwines with glassy Britpop guitars as she dreams about hopping on a motorcycle and leaving her erstwhile lover in the dust. When the momentum builds to a fierce drone in the song’s final third, picture Duterte riding into the night, her hair whipping around her at a crisp 80 miles per hour as a triumphant fuzz-driven guitar solo echoes into a star-lit sky.",articles4,"['Som’s', 'Duterte', 'Jay Som’s']"

Now, he’s sat down with Washington Post writer David Malitz for his first interview in years. Berman discussed the aftermath of Silver Jews’ breakup, exposing his lobbyist father, and more.Berman talked about growing up with his father, who he described as a “union-buster” and someone that “wasn’t bit into music or literature.” After ending Silver Jews, Berman rented an apartment in D.C. in 2009 where he wrote an “exposé” on his father. He told Malitz that HBO offered him $150,000 for the rights to his story, but he was afraid they would make his father “an appealing, Tony Soprano-like antihero.” Berman indicated that much of his anti-mainstream ethos stemmed from his contempt for his father.Berman also discussed his working relationship with the Black Keys’ Dan Auerbach—who he claims joined him in making jokes about Jack White (which Auerbach told Malitz that he didn’t remember). He also told stories about reaching out to Woods’ Jeremy Earl via 3 a.m. email, recording an entire album with Black Mountain and then scrapping it, and working with Jeff Tweedy on sessions that he also scrapped.

"Rumors of the death of iTunes turned out to be somewhat exaggerated. Apple confirmed today that the company would be phasing out its long-running media player, but the move appears to be more of a streamlining and rebranding than the dramatic elimination some chatter late last week suggested.Although iTunes was a decent-enough mp3 file manager when it debuted in 2001, Apple’s signature music app has added so many functions over time that it became an infamous example of “bloatware.” Apple senior exec Craig Federighi poked fun at this reputation during today’s Worldwide Developers Conference, joking that iTunes could do even . “How about calendar in iTunes?” Federighi said. “How about mail in iTunes?” He was kidding, of course, but visions of a frozen Mac’s rainbow pinwheel surely danced in music lovers’ heads.Instead of expanding iTunes, Apple is replacing it with three separate media streaming apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV. The new Apple Music app “has all the powerful music features you expect from iTunes,” Federighi said, but it will be focused only on, well, music—specifically tailored toward the Apple Music subscription streaming service. And if you want to sync your devices and do old school stuff like put mp3s on them, that process will now take place in the Finder app. The change is set to take place with the planned arrival of OS X 10.15, code-named Catalina, in September.Self-deprecating humor aside, the Apple event today devoted a surprisingly small amount of time to what the end of iTunes means in practical terms for music fans. Here’s a breakdown of what was revealed, along with the big questions that remain unanswered.Yes. A press release issued after the live announcement said that “users will have access to their entire music library, whether they downloaded the songs, purchased them, or ripped them from a CD.” So again, take a deep breath—contrary to speculation, no one’s iTunes collections were “killed” today. “Music that you’ve imported or purchased will be in the new Apple Music app,” Apple reiterates in a new customer support page. “Music playlists and smart playlists that you've created in iTunes will be in the new Apple Music app.” Further questions about keeping play counts intact haven’t been answered as of press time.No. The press release said, “For those who like to own their music, the iTunes Music Store is just a click away.” In other words, the iTunes store—which was launched two years after its namesake app and transformed the music industry by allowing the purchase of individual songs—is still very much alive.Apparently not. Outside of the Mac ecosystem, it’s still an iTunes world after all. “Windows users will see no changes in their experience,” an Apple rep confirmed to Pitchfork.Given the seemingly irreversible history of iTunes updates, it’s probably a safe bet that once you update your software, you won’t be able to go back to iTunes. Cupertino doesn’t tend to make it easy for users to hold onto legacy apps.Many Mac users want to know if Apple’s post-iTunes music software will work with their computers. The company hasn’t shared those details yet. Maybe there’s an app for that?",articles4,"['Apple’s', 'Mac’s', 'OS X', 'Here’s', 'Yes']"
"Users will still be able to access their entire music library and use the iTunes StoreAs previously reported, Apple is phasing out iTunes. Today at Apple’s 2019 Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi announced that the iTunes app will be discontinued in its current form. In its place will be three media streaming apps: Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, and Apple TV. In a statement, Apple clarifies that through the Music app, users will continue to “have access to their entire music library, whether they downloaded the songs, purchased them or ripped them from a CD.” The iTunes Music store will still be available.Federighi added there will no longer be a prompt to sync whenever an iPhone or iPod is plugged into a Mac. Instead, the sync options will be located in the sidebar in the Mac’s Finder app. The change will coincide with the introduction of OS X 10.15, code-named Catalina, slated to be released in September alongside the next version of iOS and the new iPhone.Read the feature, “The Record Industry Expects a Windfall.

"As the frontman of the 13th Floor Elevators, Roky Erickson helped define the outer limits of psychedelic rock. Where their San Franciscan peers basked in the sunny vibes of the Summer of Love, Erickson and his fellow Texas renegades sought enlightenment in the dark. In their hands, a slice of straightforward garage rock like “You’re Gonna Miss Me”—the minor 1966 hit that turned into Roky’s signature tune—sounded gnarled and vicious, thanks in no small part to Erickson’s strangled, impassioned howl. Like many 1960s bands, the 13th Floor Elevators didn’t last longer than the decade, but their first two albums formed an indelible element of outsider rock. They expanded the parameters of what could be done with three chords and overdriven amplifiers.On his own, Erickson cut an even stranger figure than he did with the 13th Elevators. He sang of monsters and mayhem on record after record, his B-movie obsessions providing an effective method of processing his own internal demons—troubles created by a blend of mental illness and self-medication with hallucinogenic drugs. Erickson was sent to a psychiatric hospital as part of his sentence for marijuana possession in 1969. By the time he checked in, the 13th Floor Elevators were in the process of dissolving. The same could be said of his mental health: Roky was starting to show signs of succumbing to heavy, constant doses of LSD.Excess eventually became a part of Erickson’s past, allowing him to have a fruitful final act that was brought to a close last week when he moved on to the other side, at the age of 71. Through a series of comebacks that arrived every decade almost like clockwork, beginning with 1980’s  (aka ) and running through 2010’s , Erickson managed to consign his status as one of rock’s great acid casualties to the margins—a footnote to a career that purposely avoided even the appearance of a straight line.The 13th Floor Elevators had an immediate impact while they were touring throughout their native Texas, earning the eternal admiration of folks like ZZ Top’s Billy Gibbons, who remained so tight with Erickson that he was quoted in the press release announcing his death. But for as many ripples as the group created during their peak years of 1966 and 1967, they only gained disciples after they were gone. Fellow garage rockers and hippie dropouts were attracted to the roiling kineticism that characterized the band’s 1966 debut,  and its 1967 sequel, . Although the LPs have their share of period trappings, the 13th Floor Elevators didn’t quite sound like any other band of their time.Legend has it, they were the first band to call themselves psychedelic, and their music does gallop forth with the desire to reach new, uncharted territory, both of the mind and of sound. Erickson’s howl was underpinned by the electric jug of Tommy Hall, who made the Elevators’ minor-key vamping even eerier. Together they set the controls for space but they were still sons of the Lone Star State, born of grit and grime; they managed to sound earthy as they floated on an astral plane. Even at their trippiest—such as “Slip Inside This House,” an eight-minute excursion into the circular corners of the mind (and a song Stephen Malkmus recently claimed he wished he wrote)—the 13th Floor Elevators also connected at a gut level with such force that it seemed nearly instinctual. At times, it appeared that the band was unable to fully harness the imagination they unleashed, which is why the 13th Floor Elevators still sound nervy and wild: their mess lends them power, even majesty.Once Erickson emerged from his extended institutionalization in 1972, he didn’t aim for such transcendence; he swapped mysticism for monsters. Much of this can be chalked up to him working alone. Hall wrote a fair share of the conscious-expanding lyrics in the Elevators, but when Erickson was on his own, he channeled his troubles through the spectrum of his beloved horror movies. During the late ’70s, he amassed a catalog of songs that would turn into his standards, recorded and re-recorded and released and re-released so often, only the converted could distinguish complete, finished albums from the exploitative bootlegs.Of course, this untidiness was part of Erickson’s appeal, as it forced fans—who invariably heard about him through whispered recommendations or mixtapes—to dive into the murk so that they could find the gems. There were plenty, beginning with “Two Headed Dog,” the first of a series of singles from the late ’70s (reissued in 1987 as an EP of the same name). Erickson re-cut the song with his backing band, the Aliens, for an eponymous UK LP, which was later re-titled and standardized as . On this 1981 album, Roky sounds disciplined, which helps draw attention to how he could write tight rockers, like the demonic boogie “Don’t Shake Me Lucifer.” That song title hints at all the ghoulish delights found on —a gonzo sensibility that echoed through the Cramps and White Zombie—while Erickson’s next comeback, 1986’s , made space for his sweeter, more tuneful side. This was emphasized by a version of his song “Starry Eyes,” which sounded akin to the jangle pop of R.E.M. Its joy is nearly incandescent, pitched halfway between Buddy Holly and the Byrds.“Starry Eyes” is perhaps the best example of Erickson’s skills as a rock craftsman, showing how he could construct a song that would withstand any number of versions. But “Starry Eyes”—like “You’re Gonna Miss Me,” “Slip Inside This House,” “Bermuda,” “If You Have Ghosts,” and so many other of his finest songs—shines brightest when heard surrounded by the utter disarray of Erickson’s 1980s. He made it through that decade of darkness by achieving stability and recognition, but the records he made while in the grip of forces that were not entirely of this earth retain an ability to transport listeners to another dimension.Roky spent his last two decades in the light, thanks in part to his brother Sumner Erickson, who acted as his guardian during the early years of the 21st century. During this time, Roky’s story was told in Keven McAlester’s , the 2005 documentary that effectively reframed his story as one plagued by mental illness. The movie ushered in an extended, well-deserved victory lap, which saw Roky performing live semi-regularly, racking up long-overdue accolades, and cutting , a bruised, gentle album with Okkervil River. All of this activity stripped away the heady excesses of Erickson’s 20th century; instead it accentuated his deep Texas roots by weaving blues ballads and sun-bleached country tunes through old-time rockabilly and pop. As moving as this late period could be, the contented, reflective vibe doesn’t quite jibe with Erickson’s enduring influence. His legacy, after all, was set in stone when he was more myth than man.",articles4,"['Roky’s', 'Erickson’s', 'Erickson’s', 'ZZ Top’s', 'Fellow', 'Tommy Hall', 'Erickson’s', 'White Zombie', 'Erickson’s', 'R.E.M.', 'Buddy Holly', '“Starry Eyes', 'Erickson’s', 'Roky’s', 'Erickson’s']"

"The new Netflix rom-com  is inspired by the real lives of its stars and co-writers, Randall Park and Ali Wong, right down to its music. In the movie, Park plays Marcus, a complacent thirtysomething rapper who’s too scared to break out of the local Bay Area scene with his throwback hip-hop band, Hello Peril. And in several concert scenes, Park displays impressive poise on the mic, as if he’s rapped a bit before. This is because he has: Though best known for his roles in “Fresh Off the Boat,” “Veep,” and , Park was once part of a playful ’90s Bay Area hip-hop group called Ill Again (sample rhyme: “I got flows similar to snot out the nostril/Art aficionados call me Pablo Picasso”).So while Marcus’ band in  may be fake, their songs—which Park co-wrote with revered hip-hop producer Dan the Automator—are very real and very fun. As Park tells me over the phone, his intention was for people to walk away from the movie loving these songs about San Francisco gentrification, bouncing back like tennis balls, and punching Keanu Reeves, who plays a ridiculously pretentious version of himself in some of the film’s best scenes.Randall Park: Early on, when Ali and I were working on the script, we were trying to figure out what these characters did, what was their thing. And because we’re old friends, she knew that I was in a band: She used to go to the shows, and the band was fairly similar to the one you see in the movie—except we were a lot younger. At the time, we were a bunch of guys without much ambition just having fun, so it made sense to put that in the script. And it was really important that the band sound good, because [Wong’s character] Sasha sees potential in Marcus, and he has to be worthy of the fact that she has had a crush on him all these years. If the band really sucked, it would not be good for the story.I wanted it to be an Asian-American band, and the name is a take on the historical term “yellow peril,” which is basically the Western fear of the Far East taking over. The concept of yellow peril has repeated itself throughout history, and it felt like something Marcus would have named the band, because he’s a community guy and he knows his history. Ali and I both have a background in Asian-American studies, but we didn’t sit down and say, “Let’s have an Asian-American studies type of name for the band.” It naturally worked itself into the story.One of my favorite bands was the Roots, and that’s one of the touchstones for Hello Peril in that they play instruments. In terms of the Bay, one of the band members, Quasar, who presents the branded tennis balls in the band meeting scene, is played by the legendary Bay Area rapper Lyrics Born. I was always a fan of his and his entire crew. Also, the entire Hieroglyphics camp, which was founded by Del the Funky Homosapien, was very influential. It was really important that we captured that ’90s Bay Area vibe, and that’s part of the reason why we got Dan the Automator, who’s from that era and from those camps, to produce Hello Peril’s music. We gave him the perimeters: They’re a live band, and there are four instruments, and you can’t go outside of those four instruments. He came back with these beats that were just perfect.I had met him eight months before we even started talking about working on the movie. I went to a show for his project with Prince Paul, Handsome Boy Modeling School, and Dan had us come backstage before the show and asked me to do an intro for their set. He said, “We will make you an official Handsome Boy Modeling School graduate.” So they gave me this fake mustache, and I did this absurd intro, and they loved it. Once we got to finishing a draft of the script and we were ready to talk about producers for the music, my first thought was Dan.That song came way later in the process. We already had a cut of the movie and we kind of scrambled to get that song together. Basically, I wanted to write a tribute to Keanu, because he’s such a big part of all our lives and because he actually agreed to be in our movie. My mind is still blown that he wanted to do it. The song’s called “I Punched Keanu Reeves,” so we had to get his permission. I sent him an email with some of the lyrics and asked if it would be OK, and he was totally down. He even gave some suggestions.In the original version, most of it was just a tribute to Keanu and there was one line that referenced the love story with Sasha. He’s the one who suggested we actually bring that part out a little more. It was really important to him that the music be about their love story and less about him, because he cares about the project more than himself. So I expanded on that part in the second verse and it made the song really special. Keanu is just an amazing person, and I’m so glad that song exists.Oh, no way, no. This is a one-off for me. It was so fun, but I have no interest in pursuing music. I don’t have the energy to. I’m too old.I’m not gonna lie, I’ve been really getting into BTS. I went to their show at the Rose Bowl because my wife is a huge fan, though I wasn’t very familiar with their music. I couldn’t believe the number of people there and how they were all of different races and ages, and how good the songs were. I’m Korean, but my Korean is pretty bad, so I didn’t understand most of it—but neither did a lot of the people there. They were singing along to these lyrics that they probably didn’t fully understand. The group’s positivity and sincerity was so refreshing to me. I’m big into them now. We bought a ton of merch, and they’re playing a lot in our house. I never thought I’d be into any boy band ’cause I’m a hip-hop guy, but I love them.",articles4,"['Marcus', 'Keanu Reeves', '“Let’s', 'Roots', 'Del the Funky Homosapien', 'Dan the Automator', 'Prince Paul', 'Handsome Boy Modeling School', 'Handsome Boy Modeling School', 'Keanu', 'Keanu', 'Sasha', 'Keanu', 'I’m', '’cause I’m']"
"Listen to the track belowJai Paul’s enigmatic electronic soul flourishes on low-key unpredictability. He pulls the rug out from under you not with overblown key changes or forceful drops, but through small-scale, finely tuned production details and vocal processing that he drizzles over his music like clarified butter. “He,” one of two new songs from the reticent artist, is a strutting demonstration of his quiet method of upending expectations. Riding on elliptical electric guitar licks and slick, widescreen synths, “He” is wiry and intoxicating, a languid exhalation of Paul’s distinctly future-minded funk-R&B.Where the swooning first track in the double B-side release, “Do You Love Her Now,” is rooted in a roiling quiet-storm foundation, “He” is sharper and more immediate, with an intro of plucked guitar and stomping drums that seem to nod to Prince, one of Paul’s obvious lodestars. But the song easily escapes imitation: Paul’s chanted “he”s form a levitating birdsong behind him, while his lovelorn falsetto flits in and out of the foreground like a glitching computer trying to program its own choir. Just when a big chorus ought to arrive, Paul centers on those chants, stirring up thick, tensile synths to goad you to the closest dancefloor. “He” relishes in the deliberate back-and-forth and culminates in a song that finds Paul at his absolute slinkiest, delaying gratification as only he knows how.",articles4,"['Riding', 'Paul’s', 'Prince', 'Paul’s', 'Paul’s']"

"Listen to the track belowThe origin story of New York indie rock quartet Roofers Union echoes many: College friends bond over shared musical heroes, and wind up in a band of their own. Helmed by frontman T.C. Tyge, the group began playing shows in 2013 with predecessors like TV on the Radio, Dirty Projectors, and Tune-Yards as inspiration. The glossy funk-rock of their new single, “Karate,” resides somewhere between Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and Random Access Memories, insisting the swagger of aughts rock has yet to fold.When drummer Robby Bowen’s rattling beat opens the track, it sounds fuzzy and distant, like a pair of tinny headphones on their last leg. The guitar and bass don’t arrive until about a minute in, slinking in on an electrifying upbeat. Throughout, “Karate” ruminates on self-imposed pressure to become the best version of yourself. “You think you saw me in my final form/You think that this is my first time being reborn,” Tyge croons. Constantly proving your worth to yourself is an unforgiving fight, but “Karate” has more than enough stamina to carry the day.",articles4,"['Tyge', 'Dirty Projectors', 'Tune-Yards', 'Robby Bowen', 'Throughout', 'Tyge', 'Constantly']"

"British duo Killdren say “Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You)” reflects “real violence” inflicted by British governmentThe British duo Killdren have been axed from the Glastonbury lineup after a backlash against their song “Kill Tory Scum (Before They Kill You).” The rave-punk duo say the 2017 song, whose lyrics call for a “Tory genocide,” was meant to encourage fans to vote out the rightwing Conservative party at the following month’s general election. But Shangri-La, responsible for booking Killdren, withdrew the offer, saying the team doesn’t “condone violence and will not allow this matter to overshadow the incredibly inclusive spirit of Glastonbury.”The song in question includes the lyric, “Murder them all to the beat of a drum/Kill Tory scum/Kill Tory scum.” The context, the duo points out, is a fatal spread in British poverty tied to Conservative party policy. Killdren note a recent report that “130,000 preventable deaths have occurred as a result of Tory austerity measures.” There is “no way we can compete” with that number, they add, suggesting skeptics watch the song’s video, which critiques state-sanctioned violence.A representative for the Jo Cox Foundation, the charity set up to honor the slain Labour MP, condemned the song’s message—as they interpret it—to the BBC: “The direct incitement of violence and abuse, on any platform and in any sector, is wrong.

"Listen to the track belowThe sound of Bon Iver’s last album, 2016’s pioneering 22, A Million was a monument to the strengths of singer-songwriter Justin Vernon: orchestral folk fed into an old motherboard, unwieldy lyrics sourced from the well of his subconscious, old-timey terms for smoking weed. It pulled from every corner of his career, from the cafe-acoustic sound of his debut to the lush and chiming elegies of his 2011 self-titled album. The newest single, “Hey Ma” pulls a little weaker. It’s less of a step forward and more of an amalgam of everything Vernon has done with this project since its inception, one that highlights the strength of his song- and melody-making, even if it’s the most MOR thing the band has done. But he sings, “I was toking on dope” so he’s still got that going for him. producer BJ Burton returns to color the track with flittering alien textures, and Vernon sings in his earnest, untreated voice about childhood memories, bathtime (maybe?), calling your mom, and closes the chorus with a typically impressionistic line: “You’re back and forth with light.” The song doesn’t quite tower and crash like the best of  and it doesn’t really lead you to places unknown, but it places you firmly in the increasingly defined world of Bon Iver: sensitive and dreamy, warm synths and a few saxophones, capturing the feeling of escaping the present for an idyllic past. No surprises, no Ace Hotels, no production flourishes that steal the spotlight, just a small landmark on big map of Bon Iver.",articles4,"['Bon Iver’s', 'Bon Iver', 'Bon Iver']"

Both songs were written, recorded, produced, and mixed by Paul, marking his first official single since 2012.Paul’s website also features songs from , his studio album that was famously leaked in 2013.

In a long letter to fans accompanying the download, Paul opened up for the first time about the leaked record. Read it in full below.Paul has also shared a new AI-generated infinite remix of his single “Jasmine” using the BRONZE AI engine. Listen here.A message for fans.I wanted to use this opportunity to share a little information about what happened regarding my music in April 2013. As you may know, some of my unfinished demos were put up for sale illegally via Bandcamp. The leak consisted of a fairly random collection of tracks I had made over quite a long period of time (from roughly 2007 to 2013), in various stages of completion. Some are short skits and beats from my MySpace page back in the day before I signed a record deal. A large proportion of this music was to be completed and released officially in some format.Regarding how this music got leaked, the short answer is that I don't really know. I believe these particular versions of tracks may have come from a burned CD that got misplaced - a fair amount of people would have had access to my music in various forms between 2010 and 2013.The first I knew about the leak was when I woke up to a phone call from my management at around 3 am on the night it happened. I contacted the City of London Police immediately. No-one in my team knew how best to deal with something like this and there was some confusion as to how we should react. I remember thinking if we could act fast we might be able to contain it somewhat and keep damage to a minimum. However, because it was 3 am on Saturday morning it was tough to get hold of anybody. Whoever was behind it likely planned it this way.I understand that it might have seemed like a positive thing to a lot of people - the music they had been waiting to hear was finally out there - but for me, it was very difficult to deal with. As things unfolded I went through a number of phases, but the immediate, overriding feeling was one of complete shock. I felt numb, I couldn't take it all in at first. I felt pretty alone with everything, like no-one else seemed to view the situation in the same way I did: as a catastrophe. There was a lot going through my mind, but the hardest thing to grasp was that I'd been denied the opportunity to finish my work and share it in its best possible form. I believe it's important for artists as creators to have some control over the way in which their work is presented, at a time that they consider it complete and ready.I was also frustrated by how all this was being framed online, leading to the widespread belief that I had decided to leak my own music, despite my record label and I saying otherwise. It didn't fit at all with anything I had done previously in style or attitude, and especially not in presentation. To make matters worse I was advised at the time to keep quiet and leave things ambiguous, but this didn't really fit with my vibe and there was disagreement among us. I soon felt unable to engage with it at all.I suppose the music was special to me in a way, stuff that I began writing as a teenager in my room just for fun, eventually signing my record deal with it at 21, and hoping that I could put it towards a debut album with XL. I guess having that dream torn up in front of me hit me pretty hard. Of course, I'm not the only person who was affected, it was disappointing to all who worked on the music and to the wider team working on my project at my management, label and publisher etc.A police investigation started during the Summer. Email addresses from the Bandcamp page and a linked PayPal account led to two suspects who were eventually arrested, their property raided and computers seized. Nothing was found, but by this time it was almost a year after the leak had taken place. The BPI kindly offered to step in and help towards the investigation so I'd like to thank them for their concern. I'm grateful to the City of London police for their efforts. Whoever was behind the leak collected a significant amount of money from sales, which was quickly frozen by the Police. Thanks to co-operation from PayPal and Bandcamp, everyone who paid money to download the music was refunded.There were some long term effects for me following the leak. There was a significant loss of trust. For the next 3 years or so this one event was all anybody asked me about. Everyone was convinced that the story they had read online - that I'd leaked the music myself - was true, so I had to repeatedly explain the reality of the situation over and over again. It was frustrating and disorientating to find that I had no ownership over the story (or the music) and that people were choosing to believe a different truth. I guess this all made it feel like I had thousands of people not believing me, not trusting me, and also that in some strange way I was responsible for all of it. On a personal level, things gradually went south and I had a breakdown of sorts. I was in quite a bad place for some time. I was unable to work and withdrew from life in general.Recently, I've been having therapy of various kinds, and this has helped me get to a place where I can begin to think about returning to music. I am thankful for that. It has allowed me to understand some of what happened in 2013 a little better - not through anybody else's lens, but through my own, and through this, I've been able to acknowledge some of the trauma and grief. I've grown to appreciate that people have enjoyed that music and lived with it, and I accept that there is no way to put that shit back in the box. There was no way to fix what happened and continue down our original path. Looking back, it's sad to think about what could have been, but it is what it is and I had to let go.Founding the Paul Institute has also been an important step for me in terms of putting stuff out there again and getting back to what I love. I wanted to create a positive environment that artists could be supported in and stand together through some of the pressures that can make this industry difficult to navigate. I'm proud of what we've achieved so far, and I'm looking forward to seeing our artists develop.We have decided now to make the April 2013 leaked music readily available so that those who want to hear it can access it via platforms they're used to. In order to do this we had to remove a bunch of samples that we were unable to clear, so what you hear won't be exactly what leaked in 2013 - but I know the original stuff is still floating about if you know where to look. Of course, it's completely surreal to me that this music will now exist officially in this form, unfinished, and even sequenced by the people who leaked it! Much of the tracking and production work was there, but it's a shame about the scratch vocals and the overall mix. This is also not all of the material from those early sessions so again it's a shame not to be able to present something completed, in its entirety. It will always be a little painful for me to listen to myself, but I don't want to deny people a chance to hear it, especially as it's already knocking about. Hopefully, this message gives it all a bit of context and answers a few questions about it.Finally I just wanted to express how grateful and appreciative I am for the friends, artists, colleagues and strangers that have stuck by me and shown so much love, support and mad patience over the last however many years. I truly appreciate the help and positivity I've been given to get back on my feet. I wanted to put two new tracks out to say thank you.For the double B side, we decided it would make most sense to pick up where I'd left off, so I've finished two tracks that I was working on at the time of the leak. I've signed and numbered all 500 copies of the white label vinyl. I've not had a website or merch for sale before so I'm excited to share all that stuff with you. We'll see where things go from here.Anyway, if you got this far thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoy the tunes. As always, you can find me down the pub (shout out to all the safe people who've come up to me to say hello over the years) so I'll see you down there for a pint later.
Peace,
Jai

"Listen to the track belowIt happened on a Saturday in April 2013. A handful of songs dropped on Bandcamp and no one really knew what to do. Jaws were agape, articles were written, and people were in a rush to announce these strange tracks—some holy mix of Prince and Burial and who knows what else—were the best they’d ever heard. It didn’t matter that you could barely make out a single word Jai Paul was saying. It was just clear that this stuff was so good and so original. Then, just as quickly, the album worth of material disappeared, and its remnants were passed around like samizdat to whoever who would listen, venerated and coveted.Six years later, on another Saturday, it happened again, with two luminous new songs billed as a double B-side: “Do You Love Her Now” and “He.” Along with these two songs, which Jai Paul said he was working on at the time of the leak, he also officially released the leaked demos as , along with a 1500-word text document that provided some answers to a long-standing mystery: a London police investigation, a burned CD, the trauma, therapy, the Paul Institute, and that long-awaited triumphant return.Few musicians have the kind of cachet as Jai Paul. He makes the kind of music you drop everything and anything to listen to. I was at a birthday party in the middle of the afternoon and left the scene to retreat into a bathroom to let Jai’s coos and wash reverb to flood my ears. Both his new songs—amalgamations of R&B slow jams, soft rock bliss, and rousing spirituals—should elicit a warmth that can melt any brand of cynicism. “Do You Love Her Now” is perhaps the more dazzling of the pair. It works in multiple scales and registers, somehow both big enough to fill a stadium with the clamor of its bawdy guitar lines that open it up. But then there’s a closeness to it too, that comes from Fabiana Palladino’s aching lines about waiting for love to come to you and the hush of the quiet storm synths. In the middle of it all is Jai, cooing in his falsetto. Behind the chug of the guitars, a funk-tight snare, and the lilt of his soaring voice, Jai Paul conjures that sweet feeling of love, glowing and generous.",articles4,"['Prince', 'Jai Paul', 'Jai Paul', 'Jai’s']"

"The 13th Floor Elevators singer and psychedelic pioneer was a massively influential figure in rock musicRoky Erickson—pioneering psychedelic musician and frontman of the 1960s rock group 13th Floor Elevators—has died. He was 71 years old. A cause of death has not yet been confirmed. “Roky Erickson, an heroic icon of modern rock & roll and one of the best friends the music ever had, died in Austin, Texas today,” his representatives wrote in a statement to Pitchfork. “Erickson never wavered from that path, and while he faced incredible challenges at different points in his life, his courage always led him on to new musical adventures, one he continued without compromise his entire life. The family asks for privacy while they deal with the loss of a son, brother, husband and father.” Read the full statement below.Roky Erickson (born Roger Kynard Erickson) formed 13th Floor Elevators along with Tommy Hall, Stacy Sutherland, Benny Thurman, and John Ike Walton in 1965 in Central Texas. Credited as one of the first psychedelic groups, 13th Floor Elevators released one of their most enduring singles “You’re Gonna Miss Me” in 1966. The song would later climb to No. 55 on the Billboard charts after the Houston record label International Artists re-released it. By the end of ’66, International Artists would release the band’s debut album, Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators. The group disbanded in 1969, after Erickson was arrested for marijuana possession. He subsequently underwent treatment for mental illness.Erickson released his eponymous debut as Roky Erickson and the Aliens in 1980. He recorded a steady stream of releases under that mantle up until 2004, while simultaneously releasing multiple LPs under his name alone. In 2010, Erickson released a joint album with Okkervil River called True Love Cast Out All Evil. A documentary about his life, You’re Gonna Miss Me, was released in 2005.Erickson is cited as a highly influential figure among many contemporary rock artists, and in 2008, Erickson performed a string of comeback concerts featuring support from fellow Texan psych band the Black Angels. In 2015, 13th Floor Elevators reunited at Austin’s Levitation festival. It was the first time members of the original lineup had played together since 1967.In an official statement Erickson’s representatives said:Roky Erickson, an heroic icon of modern rock & roll and one of the best friends the music ever had, died in Austin, Texas today. Born there on July 15, 1947, Erickson had a visionary zeal rarely seen in 1965 when he co-founded the 13th Floor Elevators. The band’s original songs, many written with lyricist Tommy Hall, coupled with Erickson's super-charged vocals and guitar sparked the psychedelic music revolution in the mid-1960s, and led to a new role of what rock could be. Erickson never wavered from that path, and while he faced incredible challenges at different points in his life, his courage always led him on to new musical adventures, one he continued without compromise his entire life. The family asks for privacy while they deal with the loss of a son, brother, husband and father.In an additional statement, Billy F. Gibbons of ZZ Top wrote:Roky Erickson has moved on.

"By: Heather HodderCosmos Rennert, the man behind Hipnotic Earth is dropping a fresh album, Extended Savasana, this week on Desert Trax. The album is seven tracks, moving through various soundscapes, highlighting how peaceful music can also be invigorating, like a portable sound bath to listen to anywhere. Extended Savasana is an inviting new album from the multi­instrumentalist, who has collected seven sonic journeys meant to guide the listener inward, to a place of deep stillness and even sleep. Desert Trax is thrilled to host this unique album, which almost never came to be. Hipnotic Earth's Harbin Hot Springs home and studio were destroyed by wildfire, but thankfully recordings of those very springs are a unifying feature of this collection. From the opening drones of “Slow Light,” into “Footsteps of the Ancients,” and on through “Perfect Quiet” and “Releasing” the centering beauty and quest for quiet is a truly meaningful experience.For anyone who's unfamiliar with yoga or meditation, Savasana translates to ""corpse pose"", it's the final 5 minutes or more where yogis after putting tension and stress on their bodies through grueling poses that enhance flexibility and strengthening for an hour or two, finally release all tension and relax release their bodies and minds into a meditative sometimes out of body experience. This can be enhanced by vibrations, sounds from gongs or chimes and often Tibetan metal singing bowls or quartz singing bowls which are created to produce different high and low frequencies tuned to what yogis call chakras. Different sounds, whether from instrumentation or nature, all have different vibrations that resonate within our bodies differently.""Tension!!! Release... in large part is what compromises music. In breaking this rule and focusing on sustained, never­ending release, this music aims to increase vagal tone and activate the para­sympathetic nervous system which increases the all important heart rate variability (HRV), which is important for managing anxiety and stress),"" explained Rennert. It is no secret that music influences our mood, sounds are what move us quite literally. Rennert uses sound frequencies, whether deep and bass or high and etherial to extend the meditation, to not just go to sleep but stay mentallynengaged. Yogis around the world can meditate for hours, days, which westerners (no, not just the West Coast but all of the U.S., U.K., parts of Europe, we're talking Eastern vs. Western approaches to medicine and healing) have found amazing and on some days unfathomable. With busy lives I have a hard enough time meditating for 5 minutes let alone hours on end. However, through vibrations, producing different sound frequencies resonating within our bodies, we ALL can reach savasana, whether we actually go through a yoga class or not. Additionally Rennert uses the principles of Reiki which is a japanese approach to energy healing, relaxing, reaching a higher consciousness that is similar to the Indian Chakra system. Whether balancing your ""Chi"" or aligning your ""chakras"" the idea is to restore your body's central nervous system. Since our bodies our mostly fluid, vibrations, music, sound, noise, whatever you want to call it have and direct and indirect effect on not only our emotional but physical well being. Rennert became interested in this particular style of chill but enthralling sounds from a love of tribal drumming, jazz and as Rennert explains:“I've had a long love affair with live looping as a tool for both rhythmic and textural inspiration. What was once a wall of mad-scientist dub controllers that strove to allow improvisational listening and responding with other musicians in the mix, has now evolved into deeply meditative washes of relaxed balmy soundscapes for tired ears. For this newer calming sound of Hipnotic Earth, loopers are used only occasionally as a source of joyous experimentation. The technique of modulating the feedback amount so as to sculpt the looped material as it fades and evolves over time can yield surprising results. A love for the silent spaces in music has always been important to me; the breathing and stretching of phrases and rests is a lesson learned from Miles Davis’ music as well as from so many great ambient artists. The silence is a literal thing, as well as symbolically representative of the macrocosmic and of the settling and stilling of mental chatter.“The start of the Hipnotic Earth project was a dramatic one; while living and recording at the ancient hot springs of Harbin in Northern California, the scheduled September 2015 release date for the debut album Essence was missed when, that very week, my home, studio, possessions, workplace and tiny little town all burned down in a sudden massive wildfire. It is with deep gratitude that I am able to continue recording and releasing this music.There is more to the story of Hipnotic Earth that involves traversing through a reality since 2014 where I am hearing some of the frequencies above 10000 Hz cranked up20-60dB above normal depending on the quality and suddenness of the sound, creating a nervous system that is in flight or fight with almost every tiny little sound throughout the day (hyperacusis). I have had to cease doing things like dancing, drum circles,producing beats, jamming, parties, anything but very quiet music. I mix at an insanely low volume.”While I found myself constantly cranking up the volume, Cosmos Rennert's unique approach that makes his ambient tunes stand out from a genre often overlooked as ""background"" soundtrack to our daily lives, or music to which one can doze. Instead the tracks are designed to make the listener stop whatever they are doing to be transported to a lake at dawn, or the beginning of time, or whatever picture the music paints for you. My favorites include, ""Heralding the Newts"", ""Footsteps of the Ancients,"" and ""Releasing""—the finale track.""Footsteps of the Ancients"" reminds me of Ancient Aliens. This track sounds like large beings taking large steps through sand, digital whooshing futuristic sounds, melodic keyboard, deep vibrating sounds, this track sounds both ancient and other worldly. I found myself wanting to dance or flow, this is perfect for stretching, and picking up energy from the ground and releasing it into the air, as if I was an ancient ballerina alien creating the clouds above me while i take another long glorious lunge…across my living room and ungracefully stubbing my toe. Ouch.Perhaps it is better to chill to these tracks, to use in yoga, reiki, with essential oils to create ambience for the ambient journey as Rennert suggests. I put on some lavender to release tension and peppermint to invigorate (Rennert mentions that essential oils and perfumes are used to enhance the deep relaxation and mind body connection) and I try to be mindful and let my thoughts roll by me like a flowing river, letting the music guide me on a visual journey through unique, individual and delicious sounds. The rhythms change throughout, which is helpful for flow artists transitioning to their next move or reiki practitioners know when to move onto the next position on their client while providing energy healing and sound therapy.I like how he uses Reiki and yoga principles and sound frequencies which can hypnotize the listener to reach a relaxed but engaged meditative state. I got certified in reiki level 1 and 2 when I was in LA, so I understand somewhat the flow of the music. I love how this album is much more than ambient, it is activated extended savasana—not nap time! Instead a time to release stress through meditation and guided imagery, with frequencies tuned specifically for finding quiet within the sounds of Hipnotic Earth. Some people pay enormous amounts of money to go to transformational spa promising sound baths, guided meditation, tranquility and so on. I say skip that and listen to Hipnotic Earth's Extended Savasana. If the music doesn't bring an emotion out from you I suggest you get your ears checked.Even if you've not the meditating type, some tracks are certainly danceable. Perhaps not a headbanging or the type to blast with your windows down, but it may have you dancing from a carnal, primal intuition, flowing majestically like ancient beings walking and creating as they travel across the desert, or perhaps the ethereal "" Heralding the Newts"" will make you dance like a gypsy or wood nymph. Extended Savasana also just might make you feel more enlightened, playing during traffic to a fest, or listening to at sunrise or sunset fully submerging yourself in the mystical journey.Hipnotic Earth's Extended Savasana is out June 21 on Desert Trax. Pre-order now.",articles15,"['Hipnotic Earth', 'Rennert', 'Rennert', 'Reiki', 'Rennert', 'Hipnotic Earth', '""', 'Ancient Aliens', 'Rennert', 'Hipnotic Earth', 'Hipnotic Earth', 'Extended Savasana']"

"Story by: Anand HarshPhoto by: Vanessa Herwig (Visual Healing Photography)On the heels of his debut Wooked On Tronics performance at The Untz Festival this past weekend, Subtronics orders the double napalm blast of his Cyclops Army EP coupled with the command to start his own Cyclops Recordings.Where Jesse Kardon had the ability to drop some of his favorite songs, catering to some more tripped out, wobbly, and just left-field bass music, he goes right down the pipe with this new four-track EP. Title track “Cyclops Army” goes for the real gut punch, although “Glitch Fight” does aim to be a bit more twisted. We have the privilege of featuring “Loopholes” today, which does have a fun energy, but really opens him up for some inventive double drops on the live stage. Closer “They Call Me” is giving me super Never Say Die energy, which might be a hint at what the label will bring.What we do get the sense of, and what Subtronics has hinted at, is that he wants to be able to work out both sides of his on-stage facets. So fans of his classic sound will get more and more of that via his releases, but those of us who like it a little wonky can expect more Wooked On Tronics sets in the future.",articles15,"['Subtronics', 'Subtronics']"
"By: Anand HarshWe may be neck deep in the underground electronic music circuit, but our senior staff at TheUntz.com all came from the jam world, so we absolutely love a crossover.Earlier this year, The Motet released Death or Devotion, its first full album with incoming lead singer Lyle Divinsky.

"By: Anand HarshOne of the biggest highlights of The Untz Festival was something that wasn't even on the schedule.On Sunday afternoon when lightning was spotted, outdoor stages were shut down for 30 minutes per state regulations, which cut into ION's set. Not one to be put out, Jimmy Mosqueda and a gang of loose Spicy Bois found some shelter underneath one of our enclosed campsites, collected some speakers, and threw together an unforgettable renegade set that made the best of a bummer situation.That sort of action will cement the legacy of the nascent collective that is starting to buzz around the industry. The gang just put out a new compilation that pulls in a number of rising stars of bass, and that buzz is turning into a roar off the backs of these stellar new tunes.The Spicy Bois team was able to get new acts on board like Mize and bàwldy while getting cool combos like Big Red & Big City and Psyoctave & shwiLLy. Spicy team leader MeSo is all over this comp, as usual, getting in on collabs, VIPs, and the like. You can see the excitement Kevin Lee shares with the crew about wanting to get in there and get a hand on some of these songs.Do some deep digging on this comp, especially from those acts with which you're least familiar, because there are some real gems in here, and your next new favorite artist is likely already among the ranks of the Spicy Bois.",articles15,"['On Sunday', 'Jimmy Mosqueda', 'Mize']"

"Story by: Jonathan GrossPhotos by: Mike Revalds (Treevalds Productions) and Vanessa Herwig (Visual Healing Photography) In his first start as a member of The Untz Festival lineup, Freddy Todd nearly hit for the cycle. With appearances on the main stage, Wormhole, and ShadowTrix (the latter as part of a legendary B4B with Space Jesus, ONHELL, and Thelem which will forever go down in our annals as one of the craziest surprises we've ever had), the Detroiter was one guest spot on the Sub.mission stage from hitting each stage of the festival in one weekend. If anyone else has accomplished the feat, it's been lost to history.Another surprise Guccimen+++ appearance took place this very morning as the Kalliope art car at Bonnaroo became home to an impromptu album release party for Freddy Todd's new one, WRECKULOUS, a nine-track album out today on Wakaan.This latest album, Freddy's second full-length for Wakaan, which joins his Chrondor EP from last year, as well as a feature on Liquid Stranger's Polarity release and GRIZ's remix of “Audible Edibles,” is a neuro meets glitch meets slimefunk product that is quinetessentially his. Sounding a bit like a Flying Lotus album for SLUG WIFE, the synthfunk foray into heavier halftime is blistering. This is easily Freddy Todd's heaviest output, and yet his style shines through all the powerful bass blasts.Showcased on the album are two big collabs. The first is “MENTAL SCHLUGG” with Of The Trees. The pair headlined the Early Arrival Party on Friday night of The Untz Festival and teamed up for this monster. Their respective strengths are fully on display in this low end masher. Tyler Coombs reads Freddy's aggressively far out tendencies, and compelements them with straight-down-the-pipe hip-hop technique. It's a fine balance.The second collab features rising star Black Carl!, who we have featured quite extensively on our feeds the past year. Carl Bell has partnered with fellow Alabaman and fellow UNTZ alum, VCTRE, to create the Integrate project, and their solo projects have caught the ears of many in the industry, including Freddy, who has welcomed Bell on stage during his swings through the south. “Sludge Contract” is a wild one, not just because of the pounding neuro that drives the groove, but in the back quarter of the song, the boys pull out the swing, and go full funky neuro jazz on this one. What a wild ride.Between standouts like “Comicosmic,” “MadFuncc,” and “Asteroid Guccibelt (IDFWY)” Freddy Todd is establishing his bass bona fides while reminding fans that the funk (and especially his keytar) are never out of reach. There is a reason that he's become one of the most prolific Wakaan acts since the label's inception.smarturl.it/Wreckulous",articles15,"['Detroiter', 'Polarity', 'Of The Trees', 'Black Carl!', 'VCTRE', 'Freddy', 'Wakaan']"

"The albums were previously only available on cassette...The ever-prolific Dark Entries label has announced another reissue. This time, the San Francisco-based label will be overseeing a five-LP box set reissue of music by new age composer Suzanne Doucet. Titled 'New Age Box Set 1982-84', the music featured on the release was previously only available across a number of cassettes. Doucet's forays into new age music began in the early 1970s, but before that she enjoyed some success in her native of Germany scoring a number of number 1s. Dark Entries' reissue covers a number of albums that Doucet made in collaboration with others following her move into new age music. One album is 'Transformation', which she worked on with frequent musical partner Christian Bühner under the name of New Age. 'Transmission', recorded in 1983, saw Doucet working again with Bühner before relocating to Los Angeles. The following year, she collaborated with Tajalli on 'Brilliance' and went on to make 'Reflecting Light Vol. 1' and 'Reflecting Light Vol. 2' with James Bell who she also married in 1984.The box set will extend across five pieces of vinyl and come in a limited run of 300 copies. The release also includes liner notes and photos from Doucet.

"A team of US scientists made a discovery following recent experiments...Scientists at the University of Arizona have made a breakthrough on research into tinnitus that they hope could help develop a cure.Research on mice showed that the scientists were able to stop the condition in the animals by blocking a protein that triggers brain inflammation. It's now hoped that they could potentially develop a pill that can treat the condition as well as other hearing problems. It's currently unknown how tinnitus develops in people, despite one in 10 suffering from the condition.The study, which was co-authored by Professor Shaowen Bao, was published in the journal PLOS Biology, and suggests that tinnitus is caused by a molecule called TNF-A. Blocking the molecule in mice that were exposed to loud noise for two hours helped prevent them from developing tinnitus, meaning that focusing further on this area of research may lead to further breakthroughs.""Genetic knock out of TNF-A or pharmacologically blocking its expression prevented neuro-inflammation and ameliorated the behaviour associated with tinnitus in mice with noise induced hearing loss,"" Professor Bao told the Metro.

However, most old videos still contain glitches and artifacts from VHS and other formats, which don’t hold up on large, modern computer screens. The New York Times reports that UMG reached out to directors like Spike Jonze, who was behind the iconic video for ‘Sabotage,’ in order to make sure the updated videos remained in line with the creators’ original intent.  “The graininess of a tube television set, which is what they were going for, is not the dithery compression artifact that you can see on a highly compressed video, so cleaning it up went more to the retro intent,” Barak Moffitt, Universal’s executive vice president of content strategy and operation, noted.  YouTube and UMG hope to remaster over 1,000 videos by the end of 2020.Earlier this week, the Beastie Boys released a deluxe version of 'To The 5 Boroughs', which you can check out here.

The club area itself was not effected. The fire safety standards and practices at Club der Visionaere have been established along side and approved by the local Berlin authorities, including the training and certification of our staff as fire protection first responders. The resulting mechanisms and infrastructure included first measures being taken immediately by our trained and certified staff ensuring guests were evacuated in a calm and controlled manner without injury.

We would like to thank the Berlin police and fire department for their effective response and continued commitment. We are now assessing the extent of the damage and hope to re-open soon. Until then, we will keep on keeping on by continuing the Club der Visionaere program at Hoppetosse as of tomorrow/Sunday. Finally, we are extremely grateful to the tremendous support and compassion in way of messages and offers of help from the local and international Club der Visionaere community.

It's a very unique situation for me where I get to honour her most classiest minimum wage job ever. #TAMIL #UKTAMIL #REFUGEE survival story. #LIFECYCLES. #whomademymedalA post shared by  MIA (@miamatangi) on Jun 8, 2019 at 5:35am PDTwww.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Primavera Sound organisers say they are proof it can easily be done...With the dust having settled on Primavera's two European festival outings for 2019 in Barcelona and Porto, organisers have begun reflecting on the line-up for their Barcelona edition of which more than half the acts were female or fronted by a woman.More than 100 festivals signed up to a pledge by Keychange last year to achieve a 50/50 gender balance within their line-ups by 2022. Primavera, however, set about quietly making the change instantly, and the team behind booking the festival have spoken about how simple a process it was for them.""We love music and if you love music in 2019 it's quite obvious that it's done both by men and women the same way,"" said Primavera's Marta Pallares Olivares.After last year's edition, which saw around 35% of the line-up made up of female or female-fronted acts, it was decided that they would achieve their 50/50 goal this year, with this commitment set to continue as something Primavera is calling ""the new normal"".Amongst the women that played this year's Primavera Sound were Robyn, Helena Hauff, Nina Kraviz, Roza Terenzi, object blue and recent DJ Mag cover star Anastasia Kristensen.""It's not difficult once your mind is set - when you decide that you want to do this, you start looking for female bands and see that you have been listening to them during the last month,"" Marta Pallares Olivares also told BBC Radio 1's Newsbeat. ""I will say to all those people who say there are not enough female acts out there - because I've heard that - that it's simply a lie. They are out there - because they're here.""Primavera recently revealed that it will be heading to the US for the first time next year, holding an event in Los Angeles in addition to the usual European festivals in Barcelona and Porto.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

Steve Dahl blew up a box of disco records center field, which resulted in riots and the second game being ultimately cancelled.The Disco Demolition night has long been associated with racism and homophobia.

Records that were clearly not disco”.Despite the controversy, Chicago White Sox will commemorate the event this Thursday with original event host Steve Dahl, by distributing 10,000 free t-shirts at the team’s current stadium, Guaranteed Rate Field.UPDATE: Chicago's 5 Mag has published a piece speaking out against the a celebration of Disco Demolition, particularly considering its Pitchforkwww.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"MOTOR Synth from Gamechanger Audio was unveiled at Super Booth 2019…A new synth from Gamechanger Audio uses real electric motors to generate and manipulate sounds. The MOTOR synth uses digitally controller motors to replace what would be oscillators, with four-note polyphony, two voices per motor. Each motor is equipped with a pickup that amplifies the natural electromagnetic field that's emitted from the motors. Waveshapes are created using reflective and absorbent plates on each motor to mimic traditional waveforms. The audio can be shaped with the usual envelopes found on subtractive synths and there's also a rudimentary keyboard and sequencer/arp. Elsewhere there's a filter with multiple types and modulation effects to add more character to the sound. The synth has already well surpassed its goal on crowd-funding platform Indiegogo with $231,740 pledged so far. You can hear the synth in action below and follow the link here to pre-order starting at $899. If quirky synths are your thing but you're not keen on dropping almost a grand, the new Teenage Engineering synth is a collaboration with the creators of TV show Rick and Morty. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Tonje Thilesen When (Sandy) Alex G, aka Alex Giannascoli, released ""Bobby,"" the lead single from his excellent 2017 LP  Rocket, it felt like a revolution in the prolific Philadelphia musician’s songwriting. With its timeless country-twinged swing, lonesome fiddle, and mournfully heartfelt lyrics, it’s one of the best standalone songs of his catalog, and it set the stage for his most fully-formed and ambitious LP yet. After a couple of relatively quiet years off, Giannascoli’s latest song ""Gretel"" captures the same jaw-dropping magic. Opening up with a woozy and disorienting pitch-shifted vocal—now a hallmark of his catalog—""Gretel"" unfolds into a dense and knotty slow-burner. Like most great (Sandy) Alex G songs, there’s a sense of foreboding darkness at the center of the arrangement. With its thundering bass, clanging guitars, and siren-like atmosphere, the song feels practically spooky. But once it gets to the chorus and Giannascoli sings, ""good people got something to lose"" over an acoustic guitar, the song luxuriates in some of his most easily repeatable hooks yet. It proves that (Sandy) Alex G is one of the foremost experts at building and resolving tension. The track is the first taste off his upcoming ninth LP House of Sugar, which is set to come out September 13 via Domino Records. Considering the strength of this lead single, count it as one of the most anticipated LPs of the year so far. Watch the wistful Zev Magasis-directed video for it below.

"Photo via the YouTube video for ""Panini""On December 3, 2018, the then 19-year-old rapper Lil Nas X quietly uploaded his debut song “Old Town Road” to YouTube. It was ostensibly a joke with its Red Dead Redemption 2-themed video, unabashed “yeehaw agenda” sloganeering, and the Nine Inch Nails-sampling beat courtesy of producer YoungKio. But the song went viral on TikTok, landed on the Billboard country charts (before it infamously removed), got a remix from Billy Ray Cyrus, and has since sat comfortably on top of the Hot 100 for the last 11 weeks. That’s a lot of attention, hype, and pressure for any artist—but it’s especially so for one who's only officially released a single track. But with his forthcoming  7 EP, out Friday, the artist born Montero Lamar Hill can branch out from the overwhelming attention his debut received. The upcoming effort is seven songs total and features a new single called “Panini.” The song is a left turn for Lil Nas X that ditches the cowboy affectations of “Old Town Road” in favor of a more straightforward trap pop vibe. Over a booming and expansive bass and drums from producers Take a Daytrip and Dot da Genius, Lil Nas X proves he can write some infectious hooks as he croons, “Just say to me what you want from me.” That line's melody kinda sounds like Nirvana's ""In Bloom,"" which could be why Kurt Cobain is officially credited as a songwriter on Apple Music.""Panini"" is a song about his newfound success and the expectations of his burgeoning fanbase that references the kids' show  Chowder. It first premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 Radio Show, where he revealed, ""I really want this to happen. I already know it's going to happen to get Drake on the remix of ""Panini..."" This man's a goat. he's the biggest inspiration musically for everybody."" If Lil Nas X is for real, his ambitions match his already stratospheric ascent.While it’s way too early and the bar is set too high to compare it to his first single, this track has enough legs to stand on its own.

The trio of Misha Lindes (vocals/guitar), Dakota Peterson (bass), and David Ruiz (drums) have been concocting this West Coast gold as a trio for a little over a year, but these songs have been ruminating in longtime LA resident Lindes’ head since elementary school.After a handful of EPs and 7”s, though,  Water—out this Friday, June 14—feels and sounds like something new. “My goal was to paint a picture of what LA is in my head, rather than the reality of it,” he explains. “The reality is an amalgamation of the awesome shit that’s happening now, and the horrible shit happening, too. I’ve always yearned for the beauty in my writing of LA. I’ve always tried to achieve that and find that with my music,” he adds. So you get hyper-stylized doo-wop on “The Ocean,” almost parodic in its play with the genre’s tropes. “Breakfast” sounds like a barbershop quartet performed by fans of Panda Bear and really good weed. But there’s an earnestness and honesty to the music that only comes about through Lindes’ undying obsession with his hometown.Even though the record was assembled over multiple years and went through multiple iterations of SadGirl, it’s still hyper-focused on a specific style. “Because the album was all coming from the same place—my stupid, weird brain—it wound up sounding cohesive. Part of making it feel that way was arranging the track order in a way that narratively made sense in my head,” he explains. “As I was compiling songs, I began to realize that there were themes that were unintentionally or intentionally revealing themselves in those tracks.”Lindes comes from a city of storytellers, and has made an album of stories. “I’m terribly nostalgic and pretty romantic,” he says. “Living here enhances my experience when I read a book about Los Angeles or see a movie about it. It turns a regular city into a really magical place. If you’re reading Joan Didion or some pulp novel, you feel that world when you’re driving down Wilshire Boulevard.” Water is a heartbroken record, but it doesn’t linger on heartbreak. It’s emotionally available, which is where a name like SadGirl matches the music made by three dudes. This is something Lindes has thought about endlessly and something he still struggles with. “When I started the group I was trying to challenge the like macho punk mentally shit that I knew coming out of Venice growing up as a kid, and having a group that didn’t have some violent machismo name was my way of challenging that headspace,” he says. It’s less ironic than a direct confrontation of a hyper-masculinity that still pervades Los Angeles and the music scene, although in a different way than it did when Lindes was growing up. Water is a story from Lindes stretched out over the PCH. “This album is just my attempt to share my experience of Los Angeles,” he explains. Because the city and its sounds are endless and often unexplainable, Lindes is only hoping to relate. “If there’s even one person that has a portion of that experience, I feel like it’s a successful record,” he explains. This is his goal for the album, to make something people can imagine when they visit Los Angeles, the same way Babitz’s Chateau Marmont or Paul Thomas Anderson’s valley are so readily available when driving the city streets.

"Every week, the Noisey staff puts together a list of the best and most important albums, mixtapes, and EPs from the past seven days. Sometimes it includes projects we’ve written about on the site already; sometimes it's just made up of great records that we want everyone to hear, but never got the chance to write about. The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.Save MeAdmittedly fried by all the benzos and the emotional weight of all the wanton decisions he’s made, Future uses his new EP Save Me as a plea for deliverance. At least theoretically. On “XanaX Damage” he’s recalcitrant for, perhaps even fearful of, the effects that decades of substance use has had on his life. “St. Lucia” details the romantic choices he makes that he knows only cause him pain. He’s not sorry, really, but he says he wants to be saved. That’s probably part true, but he’s also kinda just flexing on the priest on the other side of the confessional booth—outlining his transgressions with a grin. He asks for redemption, but he also seems to be saying to everyone else: you’re leaving the same kind of destruction in your wake. “Tryna fight temptation, something I need to pray about,” He sings on “St. Lucia.” “Tried to talk to the pastor, found out he doin' the same thing.” Even holy men are stuck in this life of sin.  —Colin JoyceWhat the Brokenhearted Do…On the surface, Heidecker's new album serves as a break-up record in the confessional tradition of Bruce Springsteen’s  Tunnel Of Love or Taylor Swift’s  Red. Yet, in a twist befitting his mischievous career, these eleven originals cataloging the bitterness, escapism, and heartache of divorce happen to come from a happily married father of two. “There can be some truth in these songs without it being the whole truth,” he says. “You can exaggerate it or fantasize about it a little more than to just report the news of your life.” —Gary Suarez,  ""Tim Heidecker's Divorce Album Is No Joke""MidnightMichigan’s Stef Chura levels up her biting and witty indie rock on  Midnight. There’s no better example of this than the emotional centerpiece of the LP “Sweet Sweet Midnight.” It’s a sprawling and unpredictable duet with Car Seat Headrest’s Will Toledo (who also produced the album) that deals with the trauma of a friend’s death. The pair offer some perfectly desperate harmonies on the chorus, singing, “everything you called for / I wanna see you breathe.” It’s anthemic and cathartic, and the rest of the record is too.  —Josh TerryMirroringAs the title of her new record suggests, the New York-based songwriter Yohuna makes music about reflection. Like on 2016's yearning  Patientness—as moving of a meditation as I can remember about the merits of taking life slowly—the musician born Johanne Swanson turns her gaze inward, picking apart thought processes and behavioral tics, trying to trace the outlines of the self in as tidy a manner as she can. The songs are careful and considered in the same way, full of these hesitant passages of acoustic guitar and gently sung harmonies, that bloom and unfold into self-assured anthemics. Self-searching can be a powerful thing. —Colin JoyceOut of SightAll of the songs on Jake Xerxes Fussell’s plaintive and comforting LP Out of Sight come from traditional sources in the public domain. A Durham folk music preservationist, Fussell lovingly respects and reinterprets these historic off-the-beaten path numbers. The shuffling and ambling “Oh Captain” comes from an early 1920’s deckhand’s song and the gorgeous “Jubilee” draws from Jean Ritchie’s Appalachian Family Tradition. Fussell’s voice is equal parts ragged and welcoming, richly giving these songs care and patience. For a genre where passing down stories is at its core, this LP is modest. But it also feels like an essential document of how the history of American music evolves and endures. —Josh Terry Grass and TreesJacob Long's ultra-minimal ambient techno project Earthen Sea goes even more vaporous, using treated field recordings and “sounds that could be played by hand but weren’t” to create otherworldly environments. Less directed compositions than evocations of environments, the pieces that make up  Grass and Trees are slow to move and unfold, luxuriating in reverbed repetition, tracing the outlines of a given space before gradually morphing into something new. Whether exploring gentle metallics on ""Blank Slate"" or droney atmospheres, Long demonstrates a unique ability to take alien sounds and make them feel comfortable and familiar. —Colin JoyceSpirit VolumeVolume's in the title, but this cross-Canada duo seems less concerned with the loudness connotation of that word than the measurement. This is music that takes up space, that has physical presence. You might expect as much if you're familiar with the work of the players here—City makes crushing sound explorations, i.o is a elastic-limbed drummer, and both are focused on creating music that overwhelms you. That manifests in many forms, whether in moments of harrowing intensity, like in the jabbing noise that scours ""Faith,"" or in the more placid passages like ""Churchlight."" Whether furious or peaceful, the music they've constructed feels massive, like it's going to swallow you whole. You'd be best advised to give yourself over to it. —Colin JoyceParadiseThe Mattson 2’s recent output has found them evoking the lush and carefree soundscapes of Japanese city pop. Their 2018 release  Vaults of Eternity: Japan was full of loving reinterpretations of songs by artists like Haruomi Hosono and Ryuichi Sakamoto, and while their latest LP  Paradise doesn’t indulge in sonic excess, it does capture that breezy, sun-filled vibe. It’s the first album where the jazz twins Jared and Jonathan Mattson feature vocals like on the twinkling “Moonlight Motel” and groove-heavy “Wavelength.” But while the two prove to be stellar songwriters, it’s their extended jams and vibe-setting that make this such an enticing listen. Opener “Naima’s Dream” is brimming with virtuosic musicianship, and it offers just the first hint of all the playful moments throughout. —Josh TerrySpiritual 2The journey is the point on this new album by the Seoul band TENGGER. Rather than get bound up in such mundane concerns as melody or structure, the duo just drift from one blissful synth sequence to the next—not in a way that feels purposeless, but in a way that feels free, unconstrained by genre or even by mood. There's droney passages, but there's also anxious motorik, cosmic ambience, and swooning psychedelia. If you don't like the view at any particular moment, just wait a second. It's changing constantly, streaming by outside the window as you tear off into the countryside, with no destination in mind. —Colin JoyceSign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Every', 'Bruce Springsteen', 'Taylor Swift’s', 'Tim Heidecker', 'Midnight', 'Yohuna', 'Fussell’s', '""', 'Japan', 'Haruomi Hosono', 'Ryuichi Sakamoto', 'Jared', 'Wavelength', 'TENGGER']"
"Photo by Kevin Mazur/WireImageLast week, 18 hours of material from Radiohead’s  OK Computer recording sessions from 1995 to 1998 were leaked online. The group has long been transparent about their process, often releasing demos, b-sides, and outtakes from their catalog. But these files, which were allegedly minidiscs hacked from Thom Yorke’s personal collection, were a vast treasure trove of creativity-in-progress from their most ubiquitous album. Among the many cool things contained in the data dump included an exciting first pass of their b-side “Lift,” originally unveiled their expanded 2017 reissue of the LP  OKNOTOK, along with early versions of later Radiohead songs like “Nude,” “Life In A Glass House,” and alternate mixes of every album cut. However cool and exciting these releases were for diehards, they still weren’t initially shared with the consent of the band. Because Radiohead largely hasn’t seemed to mind their music being shared for online, they officially released all of the leaked sessions on Bandcamp. In a statement, guitarist Jonny Greenwood explained, “We got hacked last week—someone stole Thom’s minidisk archive from around the time of  OK Computer, and reportedly demanded $150,000 on threat of releasing it.” “So instead of complaining—much—or ignoring it, we’re releasing all 18 hours on Bandcamp in aid of Extinction Rebellion,"" he continued. ""Just for the next 18 days. So for £18 you can find out if we should have paid that ransom.”On the Bandcamp link, Thom Yorke wrote of the release, “it’s not v interesting [and] there’s a lot of it.” Proceeds from the sessions will support Extinction Rebellion, a non-violent resistance movement combating climate change and ecological collapse. If you download the minidiscs, the tracklists are unorganized so these enterprising fans have made a Google Doc with timestamps to help people sift through all the material. Listen below.

"Photo by Melissa BrainListening to an artist talk about their influences is very rarely revelatory. It’s a question most musicians are asked far too often and their answers rarely are often pretty surface level—of course a person that enjoys both twang and guitar solos is going to be big on Neil Young. But for the Philadelphia-via-Portland-via-Montana band Strange Ranger, the music that inspires them is just as crucial to their records as the evolving songwriting partnership between frontman Isaac Eiger and bassist Fred Nixon. They’ve gleefully broadcast what they love across their catalog, from their sprawling love letter to Pacific Northwest indie rock, 2016's Rot Forever (recorded under the name Sioux Falls) to the lived-in emo-tinged intimacy of their 2017 Strange Ranger rebrand debut  Daymoon. Their forthcoming follow-up  Remembering The Rockets is unpredictable and expansive, a thrilling document of a band with an ever-changing muse. ""This record is more a product of us just trying to make something that reflected that we’re all listening to different stuff now,"" says Eiger over the phone in between several pauses and thoughtful qualifiers. Across 14 eclectic songs,  Remembering The Rockets is searching and rewarding. The album-opening lead single ""Leona"" is bursting with ""ba da da das"" that wouldn’t feel out of place next to a Third Eye Blind song on ‘90s rock radio and lush guitars that take notes from the Cure. But the real leap comes in ""Living Free,"" which is premiering below. Here, the track ditches jangle for daydreaming synths and simple drum loops. It’s a stunning piece that serves as the emotional high point of the entire album. He adds, ""I don't know we always go for direct reaction to the last thing we make but every time we write something we like switching stuff up so it doesn't get boring. We just like change.""Eiger excitedly rifles through reference points both musical and non-musical. He loves the Ben Lerner book 10:04. The 2017 film Good Time emotionally wrecked him. A 1996 Primitive Radio Gods single was ""the best thing [he] had ever heard.""""It had those sampled drum loops and it was beautiful and emotional in a distant way,"" he says. ""We wanted to write songs in that space.""Those feelings are translated into Eiger’s heartrending and impressionistic lyrics on ""Living Free."" He sings, ""eating apples in the yard / you don't know what makes you happy / all the colors in your memories."" It's a ruminative stunner, one that’s especially hopeful. ""In the future there is love,"" he concludes at one point in the song. While there’s optimism in  Remembering the Rockets there’s also acute anxiety about the future and whether or not to settle down when everything is so perilous in the world. It’s there on ""Living Free"" when Eiger asks, ""what if I just want a family?"" and it’s brought up throughout the tracklist. ""It’s so shitty. I have no idea what to do and I think about this all the time,"" says Eiger,. ""Everything is so fucked and terrifying but if you want a family and the fucked-ness of the world holds you back, you’re basically folding. Your life will be a hellish slog. When I’m feeling good about it, that’s how I feel but it’s hard."" It’s that defiance and kindness that moves Remembering The Rockets to being a standout LP in 2019, a document of a band figuring out who they want to be. Remembering the Rockets is out July 26.

"According to the Los Angeles-based musician Scott Gilmore, the music that we call ""pop"" could stand to be a little weirder. ""I wouldn’t say I am interested in pop music,"" he says. ""I think the more traditionally 'pop' a song is, the less I tend to like it. This is because I appreciate it when artists take risks in their songs."" As his own music has crystallized over the year, moving from mono synth experiments to more song-like forms, Gilmore has been intent on keeping his music a little more out there than pop music as a form generally allows. His album  Two Roomed Motel, released in March, was full of ghostly whispers and puttering beats eked out of old tech. The songs are hooky and memorable, but there's something off about them—the distinct feeling that they're stitched together by one solitary guy, obsessing over every little idiosyncratic detail. For his Noisey Mix, Gilmore decided to pay tribute to music made from a similar place. He doesn't consider himself a DJ, so for inspiration, he looked to a radio show hosted by fellow LA musician Jimi Hey called  Rainbow Jail that pulls together strange pop-inflected music from the past. Gilmore says that due to both the isolated space that record-making puts him in and the fact that he doesn't really have much patience for looking for music online,  Rainbow Jail has constituted most of his pleasure-listening of late. In the show, Hey slams eccentric songs with absurd production choices, often drawing on old synth-pop archives or weirdo psych curios or forgotten post-punk gems. ""They are usually somewhat familiar,"" Gilmore says of the songs that Hey plays. ""Yet at the same time, there is something  off about each song: experimental production techniques, bizarre instrumentation, or unconventional chord changes.""Gilmore's mix is a collection of hard-to-find songs that he discovered through the show, each of which serves as a window into the sort of experimental choices he makes in his own music. It's all wonderful, immediately enjoyable stuff—just don't call it pop. Listen below alongside an interview with Gilmore about  Rainbow Jail, the never-ending search for old weird music, and, uh, Stoic philosophers.NOISEY: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting?Scott Gilmore: I really enjoy walking around while listening to it. I’ve listened in the car, and the train, but walking still seems to be the most fitting. Was there any specific concept to the mix?I don’t consider myself a DJ. I’ve never had the right type of patience to search for music on the Internet, and I don’t actively go to record stores anymore and sift through bins—I live too far away from any record store for me to justify spending a whole day doing that. All of these songs are taken from the vast catalog of  Rainbow Jail mixes made by Jimi Hey, which have all been broadcasted online from the Dublab studio in Los Angeles. I have been immersed in Jimi’s mixes for the past several months, and aside from oldies AM radio, and philosophy podcasts,  Rainbow Jail is all I listen to lately. Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?I think from 20 minutes, starting off with the song ""Lost A Number,"" and going all the way through to the song ""Yanks"" at about 30 minutes is a pretty good run. Is synesthesia a real thing? If so, what color is this mix?I always assumed it was. I looked online a bit to check and there seemed to be a lot of research on the subject all suggesting it’s a real thing.Since I don’t have synesthesia, I can’t say. But I imagine that it changes color quite a bit throughout the mix, maybe even every track. It probably looks something like a rainbow.  What draws you to Jimi Hey's radio show?All of the songs he plays have this quality of sounding like hits from a parallel universe. Take the song ""River Lane"" in this mix. It’s a typical-sounding psychedelic folk tune, sort of in the world of Nick Drake, but it has this extreme vocal delay, hard-panned to a side opposite the vocals. It’s a very extreme production decision, but that’s what takes the song to this other world—where something that maybe doesn’t make sense or isn’t technically the “correct” thing to do is always done. I think a lot of the songs that are in his mixes have this quality to them, which is a quality I really appreciate as a listener.I’ve known of Jimi for some time, but I can’t remember how I first came across his mixes. In 2007 or 2008, when Ariel Pink formed a new band and started playing around LA a lot, Jimi Hey was playing the drums. He was also a member of this interesting noise group called Indian Jewelry, who I was into at the time. Over the past year, Jimi and I have been intermittently collaborating on some songs. I think I got turned onto his Soundcloud page sometime around then. For a while I wasn’t listening to much music at all, with the exception of [Bach's]  The Well-Tempered Clavier. The reason for that was a combination of two things. I needed mental space between moments of recording my own music. It was, and still is, overwhelming to always listen to music that has been produced in a studio. I can’t help but analyze everything I’m hearing. The second reason was that I don’t like deciding what to listen to. I’d listen to FM radio, but it’s all shit. YouTube is an amazing resource, but I don’t have the patience to sift through everything, and I haven’t spent enough time on it to get the algorithms to play music I really enjoy. When I finally got a phone that allowed me to download the Soundcloud app,  Rainbow Jail immediately became the place I went to listen to music. What's special about the music Jimi digs up?All of his mixes contain such a wide range of music. They are all, for the most part, two hours long, the production is exceptional on every track he selects—not only in a technical, but often in an experimental way. He also features songs that have this quality of risk-taking in regard to production. The producers are usually not making obvious decisions. More often than not they tend to make very original decisions, which upon first listen can be startling, but over time it’s those decisions that make the tracks so special. In the description you sent over, you also mentioned that you're listening to a lot of philosophy podcasts. Is that something that you've studied before or a later life interest?I’ve been interested in philosophy for a long time. I’ve fallen out of the habit of reading it since not being in school, but I’ve always enjoyed it. I started getting back into it more actively after someone showed me this philosophy podcast which works its way from early ancient philosophy to the modern day. I wouldn’t say I’m studying it. I enjoy reading it occasionally, but mostly it’s really enjoyable to be presented with new ideas and different ways of looking at various aspects of life. What are you invested in right now?I’d never read any of the philosophies of the Stoics before, but this podcast focused on them for a few segments and I’ve since been reading  The Shortness of Life by Seneca. Right from the very beginning there are certain passages which are surprisingly applicable even today. He talks about how people are very skilled at being frivolous with their time, yet surprised by how short life appears when they are at their death. It calls to mind countless hours of mindless social media engagement, which seems to be the accepted use of time for a person in today’s world. I appreciate the Stoics' dissatisfaction with the pursuit of pleasure and I tend to agree with their desire to use the free time that one has in pursuit of virtue. Does this interest ever manifest in your music in any appreciable way?In everything I’ve released so far, no it hasn’t. But I’m currently working on a new album and several of the songs call for singing. Maybe over time as I internalize these different philosophies they will begin to appear in some way in the lyrics. With the exception of the track from Lost Animal, a lot of the songs on here are from the 90s or before. Is that typical of your listening habits? Is there something in the sounds/production of 70s and 80s pop that you connect to more?Yes, I do like the sound of old drum machines and old synthesizers, but that’s not why I mostly listen to old stuff. I’m not actively digging for any music, including music that’s being made today. Most of the songs on Jimi’s mixes are older and obscure—had I been alive at the time, I probably wouldn’t have even known about a lot of this music. I assume there is music being made somewhere right now that I would really enjoy. I just won’t ever hear it, because I’ll never take the time to dig for it.I do notice that music being made today generally tends to fall short in comparison with music from the 70s and 80s in three respects: the songwriting, the musicianship, and the production. So much music from back then achieves a high degree of all three of these qualities. I notice that even some contemporary music which I like, tends to fall short in at least one of those areas. But, like I’ve said, I really don’t spend the time needed to find the stuff of today that I would really appreciate.  To what degree are you interested in pop music as a form? I feel like over time, your work has coalesced into more song-like forms. And this mix obviously shows that it’s something you care about in some capacity. It's just not something I necessarily would have expected back when I first heard   Volume 01 .To use the song ""River Lane"" as an example again, with respect to the effect on the vocals—that decision wasn’t the best decision in order to make it “poppy,” but that’s why I like the song even more. It’s so interesting to listen to. I wouldn’t expect it, and at first maybe it’s unsettling, but it’s much more of an interesting song because of it.I would actually say that I don’t like pop music as a whole. It seems that the less interesting and less musically challenging something becomes, the more closely it’s then related to the definition of pop. I’ve always been interested in music that follows a song form, and especially songs that are almost pop songs, but become something much more interesting because of their deviation from what’s expected. Arthur Russell, Ariel Pink, and R. Stevie Moore are great examples of songwriters who are able to achieve this. I know there are countless others, but I’ve never been skilled at finding them.Tracklist:1. Holly B – No Lies (UK, 80)2. Fingerprintz – Wet Job (UK, 79) 3.

"There is an impossible amount of music released each year. This has always been true, but in the streaming era, it's harder to keep up with than ever. And we get it, you're busy. How are you going to listen to all the spiritual drone records and abstract noise raps that fill Bandcamp every single day? Lucky for you, we're always listening, so we dug up just a few of the best albums that didn't get as much attention as they should have so far this year.~~~In the age of the infinite scroll, any occasion to slow down merits praise, but the Bay Area born composer Ana Roxanne does so with purpose. Her mission statement comes in the form of a track called, simply ""Slowness,"" a breathy synth piece on which a voice intones slowly: ""In existential mathematics […] the degree of speed is directly proportional to the intensity of forgetting."" The implication is intuitive. The more you're willing to pause and take in your surroundings, the richer your experiences can be. The details are more vibrant, the colors more full. This is true of Roxanne's music, in which crawling drones and plodding synth sequences lap and purl in unhurried ways, allowing space for reflection, stillness, and solitude. There is something trance-like, and mantra-esque that makes these short pieces feel like devotional music. Roxanne, who was raised in the Catholic church, clearly has these things on her mind. She makes the case with this tape that it's actually slowness that is closest to godliness. —Colin Joyce | LISTENThe OracleThe Chicago-based composer Angel Bat Dawid places her mystic take on jazz in a long tradition of Black artists who've used music to overcome trauma. ""It all started because people snuck away from the establishment and the oppression to soothe their souls through sound—that’s the music I play,"" she told Bandcamp earlier this year.  The Oracle, her debut for the Chicago avant-gardists International Anthem, is a pure expression in that lineage. The album was recorded entirely to cell phones, and Bat Dawid played every instrument, layering mantra-like vocals over these elliptical, allusive arrangements that are both slow-moving and deceptively complex. It's the rare record that can function both as music for mediation, and something even deeper, revealing truths beyond what we can see. Bat Dawid has said that when she writes lyrics she feels like they come ""from somewhere else."" This makes sense; the music contained in  The Oracle feels like it comes from a higher place. —Colin Joyce | LISTENSanguine RegumIf we happened to live in a world where liner notes still existed and people paid them any mind, the name Anu Sun might cop the respect it truly deserves. This Harlem-based affiliate of Robert Glasper had his hand in a number of projects helmed by the heralded jazz pianist including  Black Radio 2 and the Miles Davis reimagining  Miles Ahead. On this project, Anu comes through with an uptown genre clash in line with his vital series of The Shed live jam sessions at Ginny’s Supper Club on Lenox Avenue. Politically charged cuts like ""KAEPtain AmeriKKKa"" and ""SONset Reprise"" delve into the issues and tragedies of American racism, while guests like Farrah Boulé, Bria Monét, and the aforementioned Glasper bring their formidable talents to Anu's robust contemporary productions.  —Gary Suarez | LISTENI'll Miss YouThe New York-based duo Bathe never want summer to end. Their debut EP,  I'll Miss You, finds producer Corey Smith-West and singer Devin Hobdy ruminating on the warmth of summer and the sticky feelings that melt like dollar popsicles. Traces of funk drip on ""Dealer,"" with a bubbling bassline that examines the sweltering heat of a romance in the warmer months. Like school children with the promise of a new year ahead of them, the duo doesn't want to say goodbye to their lover. ""I wouldn't stay for anyone, but you,"" Hobdy sings. ""Kimmi,"" the following song, is a reminder that even vacation flings cool down. The pair muse on the feeling being ghosted, listing the possibilities why they've been stood up: ""Tell me you slept through the text and the calls / I wouldn't blame you at all."" —Kristin Corry | LISTENCovert ContractsUrgent and intense, the searing post-punk from Control Top hits with the same satisfaction of finally sticking up for yourself. It’s a defiant and necessarily abrasive statement from the Philadelphia trio with songs that emphatically combat toxic behaviors. Opener ""Type A"" rails against aggression with singer and bassist Ali Carter growling, ""Who gave you the right to decide what’s right / Your false authority is dreadful and boring me."" Chiming guitars and a throbbing bass line ramp up the intensity on ""Unapologetic,"" while shoegaze-minded fuzz envelops the 90s-evoking ""Prism."" It's a whiplash-inducing ride through several movements of heavy music, but the unmissable energy and empathy from the trio make it one worth taking.  —Josh Terry | LISTENWaterDehd started as a creative vessel for a budding romantic relationship between songwriters Jason Balla (formerly of Ne-Hi) and Emily Kempf (formerly of Lala Lala) but when they broke up, they decided to continue to process their feelings for each other through the band. The result is a cathartic listen, even without the origin story; this isn't just a Chicago DIY  Rumours. Over Balla's percussive, clanging guitar work, their yelping voices settle into compelling harmonies throughout. While their feelings for each other have evolved and settled, their musical bond is still obviously strong.  —Josh Terry | LISTEN I Don't Know How to Be HappyA world of trauma and violence is chewed up, metabolized, and turned into fuel on Deli Girls' sophomore album  I Don't Know How to Be Happy. Over eight tracks, Danny Orlowski and Tommi Kelly rage and rave, screaming about feeling trapped by the carceral state, suicidal ideation, and governmental control over marginalized bodies, among other infuriating aspects of this hell-earth. It's easy to curl up and cocoon yourself in the face of such strife. But Deli Girls take the other path, turning the pain into rallying cries. These songs are heard best in dark rooms, hundreds of other people screaming along every word, finding solidarity in their brokenness. But you can simulate that experience on your own. Turn it up as loud as your speakers will allow; know that you're not alone.  —Colin Joyce | LISTENConversationsThe Dove and the Wolf are best when they're singing simple and melancholic harmonies. The Paris-born, Philadelphia- and Nashville-based duo of Paloma Gil and Louise Hayat-Camard effortlessly broadcast their chemistry through the modest  Conversations. ""Free Around You"" is a perfect distillation why they work so well together—their twinkling guitars and amiable voices interlock in this wonderfully plaintive way. Much of the album's headspace is occupied with mournful and quiet catharsis, but there are also songs like ""Growing Apart,"" which finds its power in guitar-based atmospherics that evolve into a psychedelic bass-led breakdown. Opener ""Queens"" is also a highlight, with its bright acoustic guitars and inescapably infectious chorus.  —Josh Terry | LISTENCheeba GoldShould you ever tire of the endless YouTube playlists promising ""lo-fi beats to study to,"" there's a whole trove of producers who've been making blunted beat tapes for decades. Emancipator has been plumbing similar depths since he self-released of  Soon It Will Be Cold Enough—a 12-track debut of mellow violin, piano, and guitar parts strung over slow-moving hip-hop beats—back in 2006. His new EP with the producer 9 Theory,  Cheeba Gold, follows in that tradition. Across four tracks, the EP slowly builds organic, acoustic melodies into something progressively more electronic sounding, always with a sense of nostalgia and melancholy that's perfect for getting into a creative flow. It's a lovely little slice of atmospheric, oozing bliss. —Nicole Clark | LISTENGangaleeWhether or not you realize it, this Puerto Rican rapper is one of the most popular artists in America right now. An early proponent of the Latin trap sound, Farruko currently features on two different Hot 100 charting singles, including the balmy reggae jam ""Calma"" with pop singer Pedro Capó and, on the remix, Alicia Keys. Even those who understand reggaetón’s intertwined history with Jamaican music might be surprised to hear that his latest album  Gangalee represents the artist’s full-on embrace of dancehall, a genre he’s networked with frequently in the past on tracks with the likes of Ky-Mani Marley and Sean Paul. For this nearly movie-length Spanish-language bashment hybrid, he enlists multiple players in the música urbana scene including Anuel AA and Bad Bunny in an effort that unifies the regional sounds of the Caribbean into one seriously potent summertime strain.  —Gary Suarez | LISTENEmergency Raps Vol. 4Richmond, Virginia-based rap collective Mutant Academy puts out music at an astounding clip. Their tapes feature old school beats and new school flows populated by a number of eccentric characters including Fly Anakin, Tuamie, and Big Kahuna OG. Mutant Academy are still flying under the radar but they should be making headlines for the plethora of great material they have like Emergency Raps, Vol. 4., which is all soul samples and shit talking, told in their charming multitude of voices. It's a talent show with a half-dozen first prize contestants.  —Will Schube | LISTENSimpaticoFriendships have their ups and downs. Though not as unmooring as a romantic breakup, there's still heartache and trauma that comes from the fallout of a platonic relationship. On  Simpatico, the latest LP from LA indie rock outfit Golden Daze, songwriters Jacob Loeb and Ben Schwab dissect their own bond across 11 songs. Single ""Took A Fall"" finds Loeb and Schwab accepting the responsibility for their friendship, harmonizing, ""I still hold you dearly / I'm far away / Never thanked you for it all."" Elsewhere the hypnotic and soft-hued arrangements take hold like the patiently rollicking ""Flowers"" and the languid and silky ""Lynard Bassman."" Even as Loeb and Schwab deal in their own pain, there’s an honesty and a hopefulness in these songs. There's a sense of relief as they deal with their issues through writing.  —Josh Terry | LISTENplaceholderFor the last three years, Meg Duffy was an integral part of Kevin Morby’s touring band, a dexterous and virtuosic guitarist whose melodic sensibility and propensity to shred was just stunning. Now that they have split to pursue their Hand Habits project, Duffy’s obvious talent shines in different and more subdued ways on their sophomore album  placeholder. Everything from the mixing, to the drum sounds, and the delicately swooning arrangements feels intentional and considered. From the subtle twang of ""Jessica"" and the way Duffy sings the opening line, ""When I get to thinking / I start to worry that you don't know me anymore,"" there’s a radiating emotional resonance. With moments like these bursting throughout the tracklist,  placeholder creates a sensitive, self-contained world. —Josh Terry | LISTENCrushingGenerosity is one of the most crucial ingredients for a break-up album. On  Crushing, Australia’s Julia Jacklin deals in obvious and devastating pain while mourning a relationship, but the melancholic moments of remembering kindness and comfort are just as important to these songs. Some of the tracks document the break-up, but others deal with the fallout. The hushed ""Good Guy"" finds Jacklin singing of a lonely hook-up, ""Tell me I'm the love of your life / Just for a night."" There’s a clarity and a sadness burrowed deep in the songs, like on ""When The Family Flies In"" on which she devastatingly observes, ""You know it's bad when the family flies in / Just to stand by your side."" Closer ""Comfort"" wraps up the album-length autopsy with something that that feels like acceptance: ""Don't know how he's doing / But that's what you get / You can't be the one to hold him when you were the one / Who left.""  —Josh Terry | LISTEN Mezzi Umani Mezze MachineThe title of this static-scoured cybernetic rap freakout claims that the duo is ""half man, half machine,"" which is pretty believable as soon as you hear the sickening squalls that open the record. The rest of it continues in kind, with Bristol-based duo of futurist producer Kinlaw and scream-rapper Franco offering industrial elegies for the end times. Beats like ""Reality Check"" conjure images of collapsing tech and grimy streets of post-capitalist collapse, while Franco stands at the center, eyes-bugged and supremely stressed out. One colorful email from Avon Terror Corps, the label/collective that released this record, suggested that they discovered Franco in Bristol ""battle rapping in Italian outside a Lick'n Chicken."" But  Mezzi Umani Mezze Machine suggests that maybe they misunderstood. Maybe he was out there on the street corner offering offering end-times prophecies, visions of a time after the machines won. —Colin Joyce | LISTENPearltyThere's never been a dearth of basement-playing, Philly-based bands singing about death, drugs, and the search for deliverance, but there's something special about Knifeplay. Singer and songwriter TJ Strohmer's creeping, fractured songs start from familiar places. The wheezy opener ""Tears"" begins like a tensile track by Duster or Bedhead, but these songs are powder kegs, pushed to their breaking points at just the right moment. Where other shoegaze and slowcore revivalists adopt the same sort of meek drollness that their forebears perfected, Strohmer treats his subjects like the matters of life and death that they really are. When he sings about violence and self-harm on tracks like ""Lover,"" he's not afraid to make them sound foreboding and scary, to push the tracks themselves to uncomfortable places. These are gnarled, uncomfortable feelings—maybe the music should be too.  —Colin Joyce | LISTEN DangerfieldQueens' role in hip-hop’s legacy cannot be overstated, though nowadays you'd be hard pressed to find local rappers getting the kind of national attention that their predecessors once received. Comprised of borough natives and longtime neighborhood residents, the aptly named World's Fair collective did their part to combat that unjust state of affairs, and now one of its more engaging spitters has stepped out into the solo arena. On  Dangerfield, the lyrically dextrous and innately witty Lansky Jones represents for his often underrepresented side of the city. A scholar of New York rap history, he employs seemingly disparate yet inherently connected touchpoints, from the  Illmatic-esque grime of ""Know The Type"" to the glossy G-Unit era feels of ""Rich Bitch Lullaby.""  —Gary Suarez | LISTENBlame My BodyHigh school friends Liz Drummond and Hannah Field, the pair who make up Sydney-based folk-pop duo Little May, stepped it up big time on their second album,  Blame My Body. Three-and-a-half years following their debut,  For The Company, they lost their third member and made an album that's fuller, poppier, sexier, and significantly more pissed off. There's definitely a 90s thing going on here; with their moody guitars and impassioned vocals, Little May's songs about heartbreak and imposter syndrome and finding strength in vulnerability recall the likes of Suzanne Vega and Natalie Merchant. There are tracks that make statements, like ""Apples,"" which is about making money in the music industry, and the title track, Field's note on sexism addressed to both her niece and her younger self. But the best are romantic ones like ""Night Blindness,"" a super folky, despondent-sounding love song one line from which—""Do you really wish / Do you wish for something more than me?""—is an uppercut to the gut. —Leah Mandel | LISTEN World Wide W.E.B.""You aren't going to unplug / It would be easy / You won't shut me down,"" Alexander Heir growls on a particularly banging track from L.O.T.I.O.N.’s new record,  World Wide W.E.B., called ""Unplugged."" It’s the sixth release from the prolific New York-based artist's digital hardcore project, and possibly the most experimental and refined.  World Wide W.E.B., which continues L.O.T.I.O.N.’s techno-dystopian aesthetic and focus on the absurdities of war, fascism, and digital control, is a seriously raging comment on violence and subservience to capitalist technology. The meld of industrial, rave, and punk is weirdly fun this time around—a very pleasantly surprising progression from the band's history of lo-fi cyberpunk. The best bits come from the bopping fury of the zeitgeisty ""Gabber Punks On Dabs / Downed Police Helicopter"" and the stomping, crunchy sound of the smartphone-themed ""Head Programmer,"" which ends with some kind of techno demon snarling, ""I need to get online. I need a computer.""  —Leah Mandel | LISTEN Freewave 3Chicago rapper Lucki has managed to carve out a fascinating and unpredictably thrilling career after the seemingly unsustainable buzz he received around some tapes he put out as a teen a half decade ago. Over the last few years, he's dealt with drug addiction, newfound fatherhood, and a break from music, but with  Freewave 3, a 15-song mixtape that clocks in under a half-hour, he's made his best work yet. The production here is never showy, which allows Lucki to effortlessly run all over the beats. (He shines particularly on the ones from Valee collaborator CHASETHEMONEY.) He’s unhurried but relentless, rapping, ""I drink when I’m on Lake Shore, I know somebody worried 'bout me / I did everything I could do, I still set it up just to leave"" on ""Interlude."" Later, on the Earl Sweatshirt-produced ""All In,"" he reveals, ""Heart all in that shit, I just keep gettin' high, my stomach hate all of this shit."" No Chicago rapper finds so much inspiration in anxiety and pain.  —Josh Terry | LISTEN Papaya!There’s a playfulness to the way Chicago’s Malci raps and produces music. It’s an unorthodox approach that makes his latest mixtape  Papaya! such a thrilling listen. As someone who has thrived operating solo, his singular vision makes him a distinct figure in his city’s hip-hop community. He’s unafraid to be himself and indulge his nerdier impulses like on the video game-referencing ""Legacy of Kain"" or his mixtapes-spanning love affair with beer (""My 40oz Endorsement""). The highlight here how Malci’s flow practically skips over his challenging instrumentals. Just take the watery one-two punch of ""When They Get Me"" and ""On God,"" the latter of which dissolves into gurgling bloops and ambient noise. As a beatmaker, his decision-making is unconventional, but even his most off-kilter experiments feel surprisingly cohesive.  —Josh Terry | LISTEN phAsesOn her debut full-length  phAses, 21-year-old Melii blends the R&B and hip-hop influences from her native East Harlem neighborhood with her Afro-Latina upbringing to concoct a sound that neatly fits alongside her sing-song delivery. Although she bills herself as a rapper, she weaves R&B throughout the 14-track project, with songs like ""Before I,"" which samples Blackstreet's 1994 hit ""Before I Let You Go"" and ""Mister,"" a sleepy bedroom song that asks a man to let his guard down. The Harlem musician does have moments where she reminds you that she is in fact a rapper, like the three-song streak from ""Gangsta Talk"" to ""Copy"" that find her interchanging complex flows like a pro. —Kristin Corry | LISTEN The Jungle Is The Only Way Out Mereba's self-produced  The Jungle Is The Only Way Out is a folksy musing that captures the singer's voyage of personal development. She lays out a laundry list of intentions on album opener ""more,"" which reads like objectives she's trying to accomplish throughout the duration of the album. ""Need to write more / Freedom to fight more / Seek insight more / Ignite more,"" she says in a tone resembling spoken-word.  The Jungle Is The Only Way Out rotates between Mereba's cool poetry (""on the rocks""), and spirited raps (""Planet U""), but she is at her best flaunting her buttery vocals. ""Iʼm sick and tired of the compromising / Iʼd rather sleep with no one beside me,"" she sings on ""Stay Tru,"" a song recounting the ways the singer has ignored red flags in relationships. The following song, ""Sandstorm,"" feels like a continuation of that narrative. The song, featuring J.I.D., find the two in a destructive romance that blinds them like a desert windstorm. ""Just fight the feeling, it's all we do / Inside, it's killing me, baby / Outside I'm cucumber cool,"" they sing in unison. With  The Jungle Is The Only Way Out, Mereba settling in a niche all her own.  —Kristin Corry | LISTENInDreamsMinimal Violence's music is all about pulse: fast, faster, and fastest. It's club music for the bedroom and the basement dive, and everywhere in between. On their new album  InDreams, the duo plays with melodies in a way that never hinders the journey forward, only amplifying it with harsh rhythmic cuts cut that reveals something deeper and more mysterious. It's not didactic music, but when it comes on you'll know what to do: dance and dream.  —Will Schube | LISTENLonely Suburban BlackboySummer is soul-searching season and Myles Cameron's EP  Lonely Suburban Blackboy is the perfect soundtrack for the long, pensive walks you'll be taking through the humid months. In six airy R&B tracks, the singer-rapper from Rye, New York takes listeners along on a spiritual journey, as he searches for self-acceptance navigating ""blackness in white spaces,"" as he put it earlier this year. He may depict himself as lonely, with verses about not fitting in solidly with white or Black communities and girls not quite knowing what to do with this artsy, emotional Black boy. But the music makes it clear he's not sad, not really. The EP is ultimately a celebration of finding joy in solitude when it feels like no one else is appreciating you properly. —Taylor Hosking | LISTEN Full Moon, Heavy LightPopular music from Appalachia doesn’t get a lot of shine nationally and when it does, it's often Americana, country, or bluegrass. While there are notable exceptions like the great Charleston-based riff-rockers Rozwell Kid, it's still surprising to hear bands like Ona which transcends the stereotypical genres of the region with brilliant confidence and refreshing songwriting. On their sophomore LP  Full Moon, Heavy Light, frontman Bradley Jenkins offers welcoming yet ragged croon over the top of some hooky guitar interplay with bandmate and co-songwriter Zack Owens. Songs like ""Summer Candy"" and ""True Emotion"" are bombastic, fun, and endlessly listenable. But when the band gets brooding and introspective, the album opens up even further. ""Quito"" and the nostalgic ""Young Forever"" stand as some of the strongest quiet rock songs of the year.  —Josh Terry | LISTEN You Can’t Sit With UsWhen rap collectives team up for a collaborative full-length, the results sometimes feel unfocused and disorienting because there are just too many competing perspectives. This is not the case on  You Can’t Sit With Us, the debut LP from Chicago's Pivot Gang, a group that contains local standouts Saba and his brother Joseph Chilliams, alongside a host of others. The first voice on the LP is member MFnMelo, whose gravelly flow is the perfect foil to the Chilliams' sardonic delivery and Saba's emotive and versatile voice. Elsewhere they get thoughtful and moody on the single ""Colbert,"" which boasts a stellar verse from member Fresh Waters. Frequent collaborator Smino guests on ""Bad Boys,"" prompting a proper rave up. No matter the emotion, their mood is contagious. —Josh Terry | LISTEN The Queen Who Stole the SkySarah Mary Chadwick had the opportunity to record a nearly 150-year-old organ for her new album  The Queen Who Stole the Sky—an occasion she didn't let go to waste. All of the Melbourne-based songwriter's music has touched upon life's big questions, and this album is similarly focused on such mortal concerns. What happens when we die? What do we leave behind? Is there any god up above us watching our flailing attempts to figure it out? She sings with empathy and gratitude for the way things have played out. The closing of the record's title track is a summation of how crushing, funny, and enlivening this album can be. After grappling with regret, doubt, and substance abuse, she reflects on the journey. ""If there is a god I’d like to thank them for my time,"" she sings. ""I have had fun no matter how it seems."" It sounds like someone delivering their own eulogy, fitting then that it's backed by an old church organ.  —Colin Joyce | LISTENEarth's No FunBrooklyn rapper Taphari's debut EP is an ode to the power you can find in alienation. As a queer club kid growing up in Brownsville, he had to embrace his outsiderdom, which he applies here in glorious kiss-offs like ""Stingy,"" in which he sends away both haters and copycats with a sing-songy taunt (""When they try to come and talk to me / Imma tell 'em to go and brush their teeth""). ""Tell Me How"" further expounds on these themes—a sample excerpt ""I ain't friendly with you hoes""—the irony being that a body of work centered on not fitting in often draws in likeminded people. If there's any justice, he'll soon have an army of aliens at his back. The freaks always party harder anyway.  —Colin Joyce | LISTEN মশ্তিষ্কের কণ্ঠশ্বর | Voices in my headAt turns both solitary and intimate, austere and warm, this cassette by the Virginia-based artist and scientist Tavishi is the product of a set of contradictory circumstances. Per the label Chinabot's Bandcamp, it drew on her experiences as ""a foreigner in a country which is hostile to immigrants, a queer woman from a patriarchal Bengali tradition, and an artist-scientist who finds the cold abstractions of academia removed from social reality."" Which is to say, in most contexts that life has placed her in, she could feel some degree of isolation. But the music itself doesn't feel lonely, it finds power and healing in its idiosyncrasies. The incidental crackles and scuffed-up field recordings that fill pieces like ""Desert Mirage"" don't feel like noisy abstractions, but personal touches that lend fullness and intensity to the wandering melodies.  —Colin Joyce | LISTEN Big RoomDance music fans have taken to use the descriptor ""big room"" to refer to a kind of techno at its least restrained and tasteful, full of gigantic speaker-shattering kick drums and garishly gleaming synth sequences. Here the producer Ulla Straus appropriates the term to describe music that's more or less the opposite of that. The eight tracks that make up this cassette for the appropriately named label Quiet Time Tapes are slow, subtle, and enveloping. These tracks wouldn't immediately fill a big room like a big bass drum would, they would seep into it slowly, like an oil diffuser, or a nice incense. There's a track called ""Billow,"" which succinctly describes the movement of Straus' music: it twirls beautifully, then becomes one with the world around it.  —Colin Joyce | LISTEN What You Wish ForEast Oakland singer ymtk's EP  What You Wish For feels like a daydream. Squeezing nine tracks into under 30 minutes, the EP offers a series of vignettes that show off what's going on inside his head. He shows a braggadocios side on ""Wish Come True,"" and outlines the merits of the woman he's courting on ""Handful."" Elsewhere he's smitten, or he's in the midst of a break-up, or buried in regret, as he is on the final track, ""Take & Give."" ""You win some, you lose some, and then some,"" he sings. ""I misplaced your prayers once, I hope it's not lost forever."" It's moving, no matter what mood he decides to show off.  —Kristin Corry | LISTENUncoveredProducer Natalia Zamilska doesn’t refer to her music as techno. It’s ""something hard and dark. Raw noise,"" she told The Quietus in 2015, about her debut album,  Untune. On her third album,  Uncovered, she adds chants and mumbles to her cunningly minimalistic layers of trance beats, bass, and tribal sounds. There's whispery, thumping head-bangers like ""HOLLOW,"" and menacing tracks like ""ALIVE,"" on which she repeats, ""She’s a girl / Who can eat you alive."" The whole thing sounds ominous, as though you're preparing to march through a field of knives, or descending into a dark and dripping cave.  —Leah Mandel | LISTENSign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Ana Roxanne', 'Dawid', 'The Oracle', 'International Anthem', 'Bat Dawid', 'Bat Dawid', 'The Oracle', 'Robert Glasper', 'Black Radio', 'Miles Davis', 'Miles Ahead', 'Bria Monét', 'Glasper', '""', 'Kristin Corry | LISTENCovert ContractsUrgent', '""Who', 'Emily Kempf', 'Lala Lala', 'Deli Girls', 'Deli Girls', 'Paloma Gil', 'Louise Hayat', '""', 'Terry |', 'Nicole Clark | LISTENGangaleeWhether', 'Alicia Keys', 'Ky-Mani Marley', 'Sean Paul', 'Bad Bunny', 'Big Kahuna OG', 'Emergency Raps', 'Golden Daze', 'Jacob Loeb', 'Meg Duffy', 'Duffy’s', 'Franco', 'Franco', '| LISTENPearltyThere', 'Duster', 'Bedhead', ""World's Fair"", 'Illmatic', 'Gary Suarez |', 'Liz Drummond', 'Hannah Field', 'For The Company', 'Little May', 'Suzanne Vega', 'Natalie Merchant', 'Field', 'Alexander Heir', 'World Wide W.E.B.', 'Lucki', '""', '""', '""', 'Terry |', '""', 'The Jungle Is The Only Way Out Mereba', '""', 'Seek', 'Ignite', 'The Jungle Is The Only Way Out', '""', 'J.I.D.', 'The Jungle Is The Only Way Out', 'InDreams', 'Myles Cameron', 'Taylor Hosking | LISTEN Full Moon', 'Rozwell Kid', 'Bradley Jenkins', 'Sit With Us', 'Saba', 'Fresh Waters', 'Frequent', '""', 'Taphari', 'Brownsville', '""', 'Bengali', '""', '""', 'Kristin Corry | LISTENUncoveredProducer', '""', '""', 'ALIVE', 'Leah Mandel |']"

"“Too Late To Cry” is the sixth relase from Ibiza/NYC based label Eyedyllic Music and they keep it in the family with this collaboration of incredibly talented artists.The original version of “Too Late To Cry” was produced and released by the multi-talented Jamaica export, David Marston? and appeared on a compilation via Eyedyllic co-founder Kev Obrien’s former label, Stranjjur, back in 2012. Years later, long after Marston had achieved acclaim via premier labels such as Soul Clap and Wolf+Lamb and after meeting in person, it was decided that the song deserved a more special showcasing, and Eyedyllic embarked on putting this special release together.Brooklyn house duo No Regular Play gladly accepted to collaborate on a revision of the song for their 2019 mix which we here at Discobelle can premiere for you today.They used David’s original musical parts as their basis but crafted a massive new version with the addition of a squelchy, acidic bass line along with a freestyle trumpet riff (played by Greg Paulus) making this into an absolute monster of a track that has already earned support from Seth Troxler.",articles21,"['Ibiza', 'David Marston', 'Kev Obrien’s', 'Wolf+Lamb']"

"Los Angeles-based trombonist and composer Ryan Porter releases his third album, “Force For Good,” a 84-minute jazz-fusion opus with Alpha Pup Records imprint World Galaxy. Written and recorded between 2014-19, “Force For Good” features primary core members of the West Coast Get Down, including Kamasi Washington (sax), Brandon Coleman (piano, Fender Rhodes), Cameron Graves (piano, Fender Rhodes), Miles Mosley (acoustic bass), Thundercat (electric bass), and Tony Austin (drums). Other contributing members and features include Nia Andrews (vocals), Josef Leimberg (trumpet, percussion), Robert Miller (drums), Aaron Haggerty (drums), Lyndon Rochelle (drums), and Jumaane Smith (trumpet). Force For Good was methodically captured across different locations in LA, with Ryan Porter scheduling all sessions between the window of 10:00 am and 3:00 pm. Sheet music and general instructions were brought to the studio, with Ryan Porter giving the players freedom to explore around the plotted transitions and changes. Three takes were recorded for each composition, selecting the best version and compiling the music around a rigorous schedule of studio sessions, writing, and touring over the last five years. Telepathic like communication from their extensive years working together, their togetherness sparked the energy for another worthy contribution to the canon of 21st-century jazz. As the follow-up to Ryan Porter’s debut release Spangle-Lang Lane and his sophomore album The Optimist, recordings initiated at Kamasi Washington’s parents’ house in the infamous space known as The Shack. As the epicenter of foundational sessions from the WCGD and the rotating cast of members around the group, The Shack was also home to recordings for The Optimist. Force For Good marks an important turning point in Ryan Porter’s career, mostly captured during the same year that he contributed to Kendrick Lamar’s critically acclaimed LP To Pimp A Butterfly and the core members of the WCGD were ramping up for the release of The Epic on Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder. After the initial recordings at The Shack, Ryan took a unit of colleagues to Pasadena, tracking at legendary jazz trumpeter Nolan Shaheed’s home studio. Next was the Red Gate Studio in West Los Angeles with Raymond Richards engineering. Final recording sessions were held at Josef Leimberg’s Iron Works Studio in Eagle Rock. Mixing and mastering were conducted at Cosmic Zoo studios by Daddy Kev, owner of World Galaxy/Alpha Pup Records and engineer for all of Kamasi Washington’s releases since The Epic. Sourcing the title from an interview passage by John Coltrane during the ’60s, Ryan Porter’s Force For Good is an album created with deep purpose and conviction towards humanity. Ryan Porter adds, “I was doing research on John Coltrane when I came across an interview of him being asked why his music seemed to attract many different types of intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual people. He stated that he made some changes in his own personal life that made him question his purpose on this earth. In the course of thinking of his purpose on this earth, he noticed that in this life everyone is faced with a decision and that decision guides what your contribution to this world will be. He thought to himself there is so much evil in the world and so many people are making the choice to become a force for evil. John felt making a choice to be a force for good would not only help his life but make his music the film score for the people who choose to force for good no matter what the conditions are. The Force for Good album is my contribution to the legacy of John Coltrane’s message of peace, love, and unity through music.” The album’s opening piece, “Madiba,” is a flourishing introduction that plays heavily into the album’s overarching theme, created in dedication to Nelson Mandela. Brandon Coleman lays down a beautiful cloud of Fender Rhodes, with Robert Miller colorfully displaying a unique fusion between jazz and soul behind the drums. Every player defines themselves within Ryan Porter’s arrangement, finding a oneness that is felt across every track on the album. It’s one of five songs on the record that stretches over the 9-minute mark, with a bulk of the material rooted in vamps, dynamic bridges, transitions, and overlapping moments. Force For Good’s debut single, “Heaven Only Knows,” transitions the record into its most spiritual and visionary form, featuring Solange collaborator Nia Andrews and Kendrick Lamar collaborator, and fellow World Galaxy artist, Josef Leimberg. It’s an entirely new sound in comparison to his past works and is one of the crowning moments of the record. “Maggie” bursts with magnificent energy and deeply passionate resonance, dedicated to his mother as a critical and inspirational force through his life. Lacing his trombone with a wah-wah pedal for one of the album’s most memorable moments, Miles Mosley also stretches out for a spellbinding upright bass solo, giving the music a distinct feel that really magnifies the records’ conceptual purpose. The interpolation of Stevie Wonder’s “Blame it on The Sun” from the 1972 LP Talking Book is another example of the glowing force of energy that navigates through the core of Force For Good’s identity and shows his love for ballads. Stevie Wonder was an important vehicle for fusion across a plethora of genres and Ryan Porter’s vision has become the same with a release like this. The dreamy state of Chicago based Rotary Connection’s “Memory Band” from 1967 has been given the WCGD update with finesse and poise, exploring the core of the original track with incredible piano contributions from Brandon Coleman and elegant horn lines from both Kamasi Washington and Ryan Porter. With Miles Mosley performing a bulk of the album’s bass lines on the acoustic side, Thundercat’s electric bass addition to “Carricou” emanates the same kind of powerful yet restrained and focused energy that made Ryan Porter’s sophomore record, The Optimist, revered across the world. Driving the pulse of “Carricou,” Thundercat’s bass solo is a remarkable testament to his sonic connection across the jazz spectrum. Force For Good’s somber and peaceful “Mesosphere” has a one of a kind moment, with Kamasi Washington performing on soprano. It’s a tone rarely heard from the sax giant, slowing the pace and energy of the album down. Brandon Coleman lays down a stunning riff on the Fender Rhodes to cap the song off, taking flight with his flavorful approach. Ryan Porter takes things into his own hands with the multi-layered trombone interlude “Neves,” presenting his first solo recording with effects and overtones abound. One of the most impressive moments for the low-end section comes in the form of Miles Mosley’s bass work on the original Ryan Porter composition “World on Wheels.” Funneling the acoustic bass into a field of effects pedals, Mosley runs through massive note lines with lightning speed and precision, bringing out the type of fiery inflection that makes his live performances unforgettable and turns the acoustic bass into a monstrous beast. Jumaane Smith returns after his appearance on “The Optimist” and his trumpet lines on “Oscalypso” are miles ahead, stamped with a rapid-fire run of notes that ricochets off the driving rhythm section with power. The LP catapults into the outer regions of the atmosphere on the closing cut “People Talk.” An original composition from bandmate Cameron Graves, the song’s muscular and driving force is stretched out to the 13-minute mark and is a song Ryan Porter describes as a futuristic action movie. After Kamasi Washington rips through a multitude of notes and chords, Ryan Porter commands his way through an exploratory and expressive solo of his own that is another crowning moment of the record. Every piece on Force For Good is compelling in its uniqueness yet connectivity to the whole, collectively glued to the spirit of John Coltrane’s design for music’s purpose during the last chapter of his life and the legacy of LA music as it continues to experience a creative apex in the 21st century. Force For Good serves as a time capsule of Ryan Porter’s ascension into the ranks of the most elite players in the modern landscape of jazz and beyond, initiated during a time when his career began to transition towards another plane. Force For Good lands on digital platforms June 14, with physical pressings to follow later this year. Along with the new album, Ryan will join Kamasi Washington’s live band as they embark on an opening tour for legendary composer and keyboardist Herbie Hancock this summer. This will be followed by his own tour of Europe and the UK to present music across his first three albums. ",articles24,"['Written', 'Coast Get Down', 'Fender Rhodes', 'Fender Rhodes', 'Miles Mosley', 'Thundercat', 'Lyndon Rochelle', 'The Shack', 'The Shack', 'The Optimist', 'The Epic', 'The Shack', 'Ryan', 'Pasadena', 'Shaheed’s', 'Daddy Kev', 'Kamasi Washington’s', 'The Epic', 'John Coltrane', 'John Coltrane', 'Fender Rhodes', 'Every', 'Solange', 'Miles Mosley', 'Stevie Wonder', 'Stevie Wonder', 'Ryan Porter’s', 'Miles Mosley', 'Thundercat', 'The Optimist', 'Thundercat', 'Miles Mosley’s', 'Every', 'John Coltrane’s', 'Herbie Hancock']"
"Album cycles come around about once every two years, but Mndsgn, aka Ringgo Ancheta, is constantly making music. He wanted to do justice to his prolific creativity, so rather than let unreleased tracks wither and die on his hard drive, he decided to put out two records ahead of his next studio album, and the concept of Snax was born. ““Snax” (one ‘x’) was a tape of remixes, self-released last year.“Snaxx” (2 ‘x’s) follows in the beat tape style, with favorites from his hybrid live/DJ shows like “Deviled Eggs” making an appearance. On his Boiler Room TV show Breakfast with Ringgo, he welcomed artists like Anderson .Paak, Knxwledge, Swarvy and Ahnnu to jam and/or converse in his studio. “Snaxx” has a similar vibe of having friends come visit, an atmosphere Ringgo compares to inviting friends round for dinner and providing “something to chomp on” while preparing the meal. A few of those friends include close collaborators, Pink Siifu and Jon Bap. Though Mndsgn’s sound always has one foot in the world of hip-hop, it never sticks with a single genre. His 2014 debut “Yawn Zen’s” dreamy atmospheres and languid beats felt ambient, even psychedelic, and 2016’s “Body Wash” took a different approach entirely, repurposing influences from 1970s and 1980s boogie and R&B into a conceptual, cosmic epic. Of his decision to focus on beat-making for this record, Ringgo says, “My own body of work is a conversation within itself. I wanted to reiterate past works prior to singing/songwriting, while continuing to build and keep it interesting.” The cover art, which Ringgo illustrated himself, was based on a photo taken by Dan Bensch, given to him by Stones Throw’s creative director Jeff Jank. The photo of a Foster’s Freeze reminded Ringgo of the donut shop on J Dilla’s Donuts cover. Mndsgn projects that his next studio album, out in 2020, will be “a little bit moodier than previous works”, but for now Snaxx is more or less about having a good time. “It’s just fun in my eyes — I want to preserve that in my work and my life. We can dive into deep conversation or just bask in each other’s delirium.” ",articles24,"['Mndsgn', 'Jon Bap', 'Mndsgn’s']"
"All this music was made over the course of a year, during which both my Gran and Grandad passed. She had been ill for a while but that didn’t make the experience any easier. One year on, almost to the day. my Grandad then passed. For better or worse, they were my family. the heads of the totem pole. The thought of them never being present was something I rarely, if ever contemplated. The whole experience made me think about time. They lived relatively long and fruitful lives. Not everyone does. What I did swiftly realise was that our time is borrowed and that our mourning co-exists with their peace.  Scandinavian luminaries Little Dragon announce their new “Lover Chanting” EP, the band’s first release after signing with Ninja Tune. Little Dragon wanted to bring new music into the world that has an airy and fun lightness to it. “For all the lovers out there, chant along! Dance for peace and unity in this world of madness!” declare the band. Lead singer Yukimi Nagano adds that the EP is about, “The force of love. Not only between two people but the force of love in this universe as the ultimate ecstasy. Whether that is while you’re dancing at a disco forgetting where you are or just staring at the moon on a clear night, it can be anything. A swim in the ocean, a glance at a stranger–it’s a personal individual thing. Call it what you want but we have all felt it. So, embrace the great mystery of everything that your brain can’t grasp and lose track in the most beautiful sense.” The story behind the track’s origins is as idiosyncratic and left-of-centre as you would expect from a band that have spent their career consistently playing by their own rules. “It started with Fred searching for a wedding march inspired by a Swedish prog funk folk keyboardist called Merit Hemmingson”, explain the band from their Gothenburg bunker. “Erik got inspired by the track and started singing! After Erik wrote his vocal verses Yukimi got a bit worried about his lyrical abilities and stepped in to add her part on the song. Håkan flew to Germany to record a beautifully tuned clavinet. Once the clavinet was recorded Fred and Erik added their flavour with some drums and deep synth bass. For all the lovers out there, chant along! Dance for peace and unity in this world of madness. “ DJ Nature follows up 2018’s ‘Ultimate Delusion’ EP with another set of pure heaters for Futureboogie. The Bristol born DJ and producer, also known to many as Nature Boy, comes with an exemplary track record, but that’s to be expected from one of the scene’s early pioneers.

"Those following beat culture in the last years might have heard about Swiss producer Melodiesinfonie already. From his tracks on the early Soulection compilations, releases on Melting Pot Music and Sichtexot to countless live sets in Europe and even South Africa. An outspoken voice in the normally non-confrontational world of electronic dance music, Moodymann (Kenny Dixon Jr.) is committed to keeping a distinctly black imprint on techno and house.Moodymann worked at several Detroit record stores in the mid-nineties including a store owned by producer Blake Baxter. During the mid-nineties Kenny was also the resident DJ at the Detroit based Outcast Motorcycle Club. At that time he was known as “House”. After his first several releases on Planet E Records Kenny became quite popular in France and from there his popularity grew.Moodymann sound is a hybrid form of techno/house dance music arrived at via innovative use of reworked riffs, samples and grooves. While he may frustrate people with his refusal to be interviewed and insistence on reminding people of the genre’s origins, the soulfulness of his output is unquestioned. Utilizing classic soul and jazz samples, low-slung bass lines and an approach to drum programming that is diametrically opposed to the tendency to push the tempo faster and faster, he has achieved classic status thanks to gems like “Sunday Morning”, “Shades of Jae”, and his remix of Innerzone Orchestra’s “People Make the World Go Round“. Following years of 12” only releases, he compiled his best work on “Silentintroduction“, one of the most celebrated albums of the late 90s. DIBIA$E returns, this time with his signature 8-bit sound. “Bonus Levels” is everything you would expect from this LA beat scene veteran. A nod to video game culture, Bonus Levels brings back memories of endless hours of gaming and takes us to a place of Lo-Fi nostalgia. DIBIA$E dices up vintage NES, Super NES and Sega video game samples, layering them with slumped out, off-the-grid drum programming, arpeggiated synths, pixilated sounds and filthy bass lines. Sprinkled with elements of house and footwork, plus a couple of remixes from favorites, Elaquent and 14KT, Bonus Levels is destined to be an instant 8-bit classic.“Transit” is FloFilz‘ third album for Melting Pot Music. It is deeply inspired by the UK jazz and hip-hop scene and features collaborations with Alfa Mist, Barney Artist, Biig Piig and K, Le Maestro. FloFilz previous albums “Metronom” (2014) and “Cenário” (2016) were dedicated to the cities of Paris and Lisbon. The visuals for all albums have been created by acclaimed photographer Robert Winter. In 2019 things have changed. Today jazz is not only about diggin’ old records and learning about Bird and Trane. Jazz is very much alive and the city of London has become one of its epicenters. The UK jazz scene is happening because it is deeply connected with hip-hop, soul and club music. A perfect setting for FloFilz. Over the last 18 months, he has collected serious Eurostar miles, heading from Aachen to London – going to gigs, hanging out with musical allies and recording new material. This is why he calls his new album “Transit”. Through 18 tracks FloFilz translates the current London vibe in his very own style and fashion and I dare to say that “Transit” may be the best album he has treated us with so far. The names people invoke when trying to describe Georgia Anne Muldrow are unavoidably, almost impossibly lofty: Nina Simone and Alice Coltrane, Erykah Badu and Ella Fitzgerald. The Los Angeles-bred singer, songwriter, and musician is all and none of these things –– she’s able to channel the greats from decades past in soul, R&B, and jazz, but her own music is too subversive, too forward-thinking to be cordoned off as a footnote to any one lineage. Over the course of a career that spans dozens of releases and ropes in a wide array of talented collaborators, it would appear that Muldrow has explored every nook and crevice of her tastes and talents. And yet, after nearly 15 years, each new turn in her catalog is a step directly into the unknown. Released by Mello Music Group, VWETO II, is this kind of exploratory turn. It’s the sequel to her 2011 album by the same name. Like its predecessor, VWETO II is an all-instrumental affair, reestablishing Muldrow as one of the most reliable crafters of sturdy, funky, spaced-out hip-hop working today. VWETO II comes in the wake of 2018’s daring, acclaimed Overload, which reaffirmed Muldrow’s gifts as a vocalist and as a songwriter: tight melodies cutting through airy beats or working in tandem with heavier ones. Here she puts different musical traditions in conversation with one another, from the way “Big Mama Africa Jam” uses the templates of this decade’s beat scene in a way that recalls hints of G-funk, to the way that “Emo Blues” seemingly shirks its title to become something stranger and synthier. From the irresistible slap of “Bronx Skates” to the piercing clarity of “Brokenfolks,” the number of styles that are rendered effectively here is, simply, dizzying. Nowhere else on the globe would the deployment of all these seemingly disparate sounds in service of a single end seem reasonable, even intuitive. Muldrow grew up the daughter of a jazz guitarist and the musical director of a spiritual center, the very embodiment of a musical community that is at once concerned with the corporeal world and something beyond. It’s why the album’s penultimate song, the head-nodding “Wu Punk,” is able to be not only menacing but a little bit Gothic; it’s why it seems perfectly natural for Muldrow to title one of the most celebratory cuts “Nate Dogg’s Eulogy.” Vweto, in Swahili, means “gravity.” Where Muldrow’s songs often grapple with ideas that are complex and esoteric, VWETO II is a reminder that their backbone is a tight, expert musicianship. The album could be played at a summer cookout or a weekend house party and be an instant crowd-pleaser, but it also rewards more attentive listening –– to the subtle tweaks of familiar formulas, to the high-wire technical passages, to the emotional energy being wrung from each instrument in the mix. It should be no surprise that for an artist like Georgia Anne Muldrow, even a return to the basics would be a step into the future. ",articles24,"['Melodiesinfonie', 'Blake Baxter', 'Kenny', 'Innerzone Orchestra’s', 'Elaquent', 'Alfa Mist', 'Le Maestro', 'Lisbon', 'Today', 'Aachen', 'London –', 'Alice Coltrane', 'Erykah Badu', 'Ella Fitzgerald', 'Muldrow', 'VWETO II', 'Muldrow’s', 'Muldrow', 'Muldrow', 'Swahili', 'Muldrow’s']"
"Hailing from Minnesota, the multi-talented young producer is the newest member of the Radio Juicy family. “Rain Check” is definitely an unexpected and refreshing album, blending hip hop, funk and r&b with futuristic electronic bleeps and glitches. With the first listen one is reminded of Kiefer’s sound, however, Slowya.roll distinguishes himself with a playful take on his music blending infectious bleeps, bloops and wobbles to his music, taking us back to that beat-tape era we loved so much, the end result, an album that is polished and intricate.",articles24,['Kiefer’s']
"An acrobatic electronic sound space is inhabited by the hands of veteran Poborsk (aka Patrice Curtillat), and 11 116 is an extended player meant to transmit further alien frequencies (ref. “Frustration Rampante” with its subterranean bass and sizzling noises)—and also acts as a debut for the Crazy Language net-label. By way of analog sound effects, broken rhythms, and smoldering DSP, here we are provided with seven exploratory tracks—all over 5-minutes a piece. Distracting as they are compelling, these audible slices bend, twist, and echo as if absorbed through a variety of old machinery, only to be reconstructed in a digitized disarray. “Octa Jazz” maneuvers about like a lost Autechre NTS Session abstract—its microscopic bits and pieces diced between rugged low-end beatwork. There are additional rhythmic jolts and sonic whiplash featured on the energetic “Docteur Flanger,” and undulating ambient thuds on “Collapse” with its pseudo-improvised structures. An electroacoustic charm is evidenced on “Haïku” as it offers delicately placed melodic data-streams via a percussive backbone going into overdrive in the most minimalistic way. An exceptional and surreal EP of glitch and fractured bass for the next IDM plateau.11 116 is available on Crazy Language.",articles20,[]
"Not being familiar with the previous works of Max Würden (including extensive contributions to Kompakt’s excellent and ongoing Pop Ambient compilation series), the first listen through of Format came without any preconceptions or expectations, making the experience all the more electrifying. Described by A Strangely Isolated Place as “a collection of multi-disciplinary works,” they were recorded over a period of two years employing different techniques ranging from studio recordings through live performances and on to field recordings.True to its name, the album also plays with the format through which it is delivered. If you purchase Format on vinyl you are presented with three different listening options: nine individual tracks that begin and end discreetly, a continuous digital mix and unique vinyl edits that mix the tracks that share sides. The album should come with instructions, as listening to these different versions reveals that the continuous mix and vinyl edits not only mix the tracks together, but also feature additional linking material not present on the individual tracks.The optimum listening experience for Format is therefore the continuous mix (or vinyl edits for format junkies), and most definitely via speakers. Headphone listening is fine, but the album really comes alive when listened to through speakers, totally drenching the room in its ambient tropicala so ably illustrated by the Eno-esque, collage cover art that further hints not only at the variety of timbres on Format, but also the sky-high production values.Opening with the crunch of leaves and twigs underfoot, “Capsules of Energy” bristles with exactly that: the electric hum of drones, surges of static and power fluctuations along with distant acoustic instrumentation. It’s a powerful opener to an album of such ambient variety it’s amazing that it works as a cohesive experience. “Dessicate” expands on this feeling of latent, stored up energy, with wowing pads simmering under layers of high-pitched feedback, fluttering synth strings and looping acoustic instruments, its multiple layers so deftly interwoven it becomes hard to separate them, even as they begin to hypnotise. Bird song, animal chatter, the clang of metal, oriental cymbals and snatches of pitch-shifted vocal intonations are all soaked in reverb on “Closeness” with another soothing background drone that beams waves of warmth across the sound-stage so rich you can almost feel them, segueing seamlessly into the title track. Probably the most difficult piece on Format, this is a caustic blend of guitar-feedback drones phase and filter, bloom and blossom, deafening the listener for a challenging nine-and-a-half minutes, latterly featuring huge analogue pads sweeping across a giant, subterranean heart-beat.It is at this point that the first passage of continuous mix-exclusive music appears, a Carpenteresque melody looped atop epic, reverb drenched Oriental bells and percussive clangs, connecting the title track to the incredible eclecticism of “Wirkungsgrad,” a track that almost defies description. More Oriental percussion, clanks and chimes are treated with a myriad of different processing techniques, joined a few minutes later by a rhythmic pulse that immediately brings Biosphere’s seminal Substrata to mind. It’s a work of unalloyed brilliance.After the enigmatic, icy shivers of “Spectral” comes the growling guitar stabs of the foreboding and darkly ominous “Metamorphose” that morph into a passage of Debussy-like orchestral strings, and suddenly the various formats veer off down different aural pathways.It’s hard to tell if the standalone version of “Metamorphose” is a longer edit, but both mixed versions feel like they cut it short with a unique extended passage that begins with the rustle of leaves, followed by one of Format‘s most affecting moments. The sudden chime of a huge bell seemingly designed to penetrate the soul repeatedly rings from out of nowhere with a sub-bass burst that shakes the room, and a cascade of twinkling keys lead into the following track on the digital mix, and fade to silence on the vinyl.Even the more traditional, straightforward ambient tracks here are nothing short of a revelation, so deeply involving, lushly textured and enveloping you can’t help but get lost in their depth-of-focus. “Exothermic Reaction” is one such track, mixing the hypnotic ingredient of a looping two-note tone that recalls Dropsonde or N-Plants period Biosphere with the heady, fragranced pastoral beauty of Harold Budd at his finest, reeling you into the fields of analogue flourishes.Though it may sound like hyperbole, the absolute masterpiece that is Format deserves to award Würden a place among the likes of Eno, Laraaji, Jenssen, Budd and Roach, such is the richness of content, diversity of technique and spellbinding atmospheric ambience. A genuine high-point in A Strangely Isolated Place’s already exquisitely curated catalogue, Format is a strong contender for album of the year.

"Meat Load heads to bat with a viceral, mind-numbing 19-track album aptly titled Glitchmania—an expansive collection that ventures through a variety of broken electro fragments, heavy robotic bass, and crunchy beatwork. Modular machinery and scorched electronics at the forefront, the inevitable glitch infusion is fully present, yet doesn’t manage to lose its focus. A few tangled melodic moments evolve and devolve, breaking down and recombining to form new abstract structures along the way. A slew of data processing merges with microscopic blips and bleeps as each track disperses its sonic slivers of IDM, breaks, and mechanical disarray.

"Atlas wasn’t an obvious choice for me. I can’t remember when it sneaked in under my radar, but it has proved to be indispensable ever since I made the decision to try out the demo. If you’re anything like me, you have folders full of one-shot drum samples, and probably have hundreds of thousands of snares, kicks, hi-hats, claps etc—and when it comes to choosing one of these, it’s a laborious task of endless clicking to preview them in the hope that you’ll eventually find the right one. When you’re in the zone, in full flow, this can really slam the brakes on that sense of urgency when you’re trying to get the music from A (your mind) to B (your screen) as efficiently as possible. This is where Atlas can make a huge difference, and become as much a part of the musical process as any other instrument.Atlas is, essentially, a very slick sample mapper, and when you open it for the first time, you will see a welcome pack, courtesy of Sample Magic, with a fine selection of various drum samples, but you will have also have an option to “Create New Map” by adding a folder where your drum samples live on your drive. Atlas will then scan the contents of the folder and you will have your first map—hence the name “Atlas.” Scanning folders is a quick process as drum samples are so short, so in no time at all, you can have maps of anything you like, from a map of a folder containing nothing but bongos, or a folder containing whole kits from other Drum Machines, and all nicely categorized. Besides the satisfaction of seeing all those samples displayed graphically as a colour gradient map, there are many new options that become available at this point.You can drag individual samples from the main screen onto custom resizable kit slots. The kit can be anything from a simple 1×8 (Beatstep ) a 4×4 (Maschine), or an 8×8 (Launchpad). It’s worth pointing out that these layouts don’t require any particular hardware controller. Each sound then has basic controls for Gain, Shape, Filter, Pitch and Pan. These are lockable, and won’t change if you load in a different kit.There are some sub-options such as filter shape too. As well as this , there are further controls hidden when you click “advanced”—You can then tweak the attack and release times, gate it, flip the phase, or set up a choke group.The real fun for me happens when you build a rhythm from various samples, and then hit “New Kit” which will load in a random selection from the folder. You could end up with a mixture of things you wouldn’t have consciously chosen, and if you like, say, 3 out of 16 of those samples, you can lock those three in place, hit “New Kit” again, and the other 13 slots will have new sounds, but the three you locked will have been preserved.I personally have maps of all my drum libraries from Maschine, Battery, Spark etc—and I can load a kit from any combination of these maps, so the potential for rhythmic “happy accidents” makes it really exciting to use. This, for me, is one of the major selling points. You can then easily save any of these combinations as custom kits for work in different genres.Atlas feels very smooth to work with, and it’s obvious it’s been coded very well. The only thing that’s missing is the “ssssh-a-ka” sound from Star Trek’s Enterprise, as windows slide effortlessly from one to another. I was super-impressed with it straightaway, and it finds its way into many of my projects now.So, to sum up, if the thought of clicking through endless folders takes the wind out of your sails, Atlas can make the process of locating sounds fun again, and you’ll make the most of your sample library, and find drum samples you didn’t even realise you had, or had forgotten about.Atlas is available from Algonaut.

"Grit and rugged bass, beats, and distortion inhabits this intense EP by Dreadcore. My only gripe (and it’s not a major one) would be the duration of each audio sculpture all in the two to three minute range. Yet Dreadcore allows just enough of a connection only to be immediately left stranded in a dystopian landscape. In these brief moments, however, each piece elicits high-energy furosity where broken percussive jungle and drum’n bass chunks interact with heavy low-end industrial sheets, loosened breaks, and abstract sonic detonations. Where “Tripwire” explodes in a roaring drum onslaught, “Nightjar” delivers dark rolling rhythmic mysteries. The slithering drums and acid warble of “Guttersnipe” is intercepted by the emotive “Scattershot,” a gorgeous slice of distilled breakcore. “Scowlware” echoes like a lost Scorn excerpt as it tapers into exploratory ambient textures. And this is perhaps where this EP finds itself—the full-on scope, depth, and force exuded on Schematics is enough to fuel an entire album even with its relatively short runtime.Schematics is available on Acroplane.Schematics by Dreadcore",articles20,['Grit']

"Yes—we’re a little late on this review, the multi-talented Frenchman Umwelt opened 2019 with a powerful debut EP for Berlin-based Voitax back in February and it’s been in constant rotation. The title track sheds a pseudo-rave style groove, its loosened breaks and acidic undercurrent is vast and far-reaching. The punchy electro exhibited on “Faceless Power” shifts tectonic plates with its raw industrial strength, tangled blips and bleeps, and rugged rhythm. Toning it down just a tad on “Endless Blackness,” Umwelt extracts further acidic breaks as an emotional anthem is unleashed. Delving into space exploration, as the EP title suggests, “Frameshift Mutation” segues into downtempo electro with undulating low-end and crisp bass thuds. The quintessential scorcher takes shape on “Breakaway” where heavier booming frequencies bust apart from start to end. In all, Umwelt lays it all out in a perfectly executed EP with blistering electro-nic force.Ecopoiesis is available on Voitax.Ecopoiesis by Umwelt",articles20,['Yes']
"The rise of electro has been a curious one. Rather than one specific artist or label blazing the trail, the appreciation of the colder side of the machine music spectrum has developed through a number of different entities and imprints. One musician who has been at the coalface of this revival has been Robert Witschakowski and his output under the mask of The Exaltics.Returning to Clone West Coast Series (Clone sub-label), five years since the Some Other Place series, II Worlds is the Jena-based producer’s seventh album since 2008. The years may have passed, but to a certain degree the audio message has remained constant; razor sharp rhythms and frigid funk. That constant is plain to hear in “Fallen Star,” a track blending astral bleep with serrated beat patterns. There is an underlying threat to this album, a menace that comes to the fore in the slashing snares and dissected speech of “The Others” and in the ghostly movements on the unnerving “One.” Other pieces stalk, seeking out with violent intent as in the aptly named “Tunnel Chase” and “Skyway Chase.” “The Hunt Is On” is cast in the same unsettling tones, sci-fi trills and lancing rhythms keeping time as beastly basslines trudge ever closer. There are respites to the relentless intensity and it is in these moments that another side of Witschakowski’s sound can be heard. Take “Symbionts Came Through The Green Lights”, an alien world dipped in aluminium and eerie resonance, or the juddering ambience of “439.” The final piece returns to the depth and introspection of Some Other Place. Twinkling notes sparkle in the darkness of muddy baselines in “8000 Miles High.”II Worlds is steeped is a narrative. These tracks depict far-off planets, ghoulish creatures and inhospitable atmospheres. Amidst the industrial thunder and caustic showers are islands of tranquillity, refuges from the electro onslaught.

"The return of Dalham (aka Jon Michaelides) signals an unearthing of evolved downtempo electronics and a comforting collection of surreal sonic treasures with his latest album Heat Death on Castles in Space. The Suffolk-raised and London-based artist continues to expand the terrain that was created on 2018’s Janus (Public House), with similar tones harking back to classic Boards Of Canada, Secret Frequency Crew, and Crisopa once again—a compliment to Dalham.As the 2017 album Waves—also released on Public House—was described as “woozy tape-saturated electronica,” and Janus as “eroded melodies and washed-out downtempo percussion,” Dalham reaches just a bit further on Heat Death. With the liner notes indicating “an attempt to convey something about a plane beyond our immediate experience and perception,” Heat Death certainly reaches high elevations if you let the album sink in—the construct and deconstruct of each piece creates a nostalgic blur that is at once captivating as it is alluring—all the qualities inherent in the above-mentioned musicians’ scope of work.Such an influx of vast, vagrant, and vexing tracks makes it difficult to focus on any one particular thread as the album is a thick, multidimensional fabric with many undulating textures. Favorites include “Antegon,” “Sigil,” “NGC 4993,” “Genesis,” and “Trinity.” There are also colorful echoes and chilled-out ambient-synth interludes such as “IRIS,” “Perihelion,” and “Infinite Key” that spark the senses in a cascading trajectory stitching everything up nicely.In all, Heat Death is a sonic achievement allowing the listener to drift away in lost memories while its individual strands rest on solid foundations that will easily stand the test of time.Heat Death is available on Castles in Space.Heat Death by DALHAM",articles20,"['Castles in Space', 'Public House', 'Secret Frequency Crew', 'Heat Death', 'Heat Death', 'Such', 'Favorites', 'Heat Death', 'Heat Death', 'Heat Death', 'DALHAM']"
"Almost two years have passed since Esem furnished the world with the exquisitely remastered digital reissue of 2002’s electronic listening music masterpiece, Enveloped, originally released by the short-lived and long-since defunct deFocus label. As wonderful a gift as this was, it was lamentable that the much lesser-known, vinyl-only ikae EP that preceded it languished in the vault, quite simply because it is not only just as strong as said album, but also because it contains some of Esem’s finest moments.The wait is over: it’s here, presented in what is perhaps an even finer remaster than Enveloped, complete with the extra track “Preledd” that previously closed out the excellent deFocus compilation album Did You See?.Sure, these are tracks that either that didn’t make it onto the album or are different interpretations of tracks that did (providing a neat connecting crossover between the two releases), but there’s a fundamentally different tone to ikae that all the tracks share. Enveloped is skittish, brooding and introspective, whereas ikae is moody, often loungey midnight music with a more laid-back, moonlit quality.There’s no better example of this than the loping gait of “Eloki” as compared to the spring-loaded, hyperactive “Eloki.neadu” on Enveloped (the opening track to Digital::Nimbus Radio for so many years). “Qre. ii” is the real lounge-music piece on ikae, whereas “qre. I” on Enveloped fizzles and bubbles with more nervous energy. And “Preledd” has never sounded this good, those aquatic submarine whooshes, ultra-spongy and squidgy basslines brought to life like never before, and actually far more relatable than the choppy quality exhibited by album-counterpart “Postledd.” The title track exemplifies the spacey feel of the EP with spacey washes, glittering keys and a newly-felt sub-bassline, both it and the similarly sparkling “Obbe ttid” throwing in a number of surprises through the four to five minute running times. The jittery “redskin” continues to showcase Esem’s meticulous production, a piece in three acts that moves from intense percussion through a brightly lit midsection before changing tone to simmering melodic close. Even without the greater context of the EP as a whole, ikae‘s final track “Dreamborder” is possessed of an epic sound and scope that belies its diminutive three-and-a-half minute stature. A bed of pensive, reverb-tinted, smokey pads start their life rippling beneath layers of star-shower keys, rising in intensity until a thundering bass-drop sends the listener reeling into deep space. Play loud!The addition of just a single bonus track in “Preledd” helps further cement ikae as a real companion-piece to Enveloped, expanding an already incredible EP into a mini-album of material every bit as essential to fans of that early-noughties bedroom IDM sound, as Enveloped.

"Medhi Saleh (aka Alphaxone) is a sound producer and electronic music artist coming from Iran, mostly known for his fruitful partnership with Cryo Chamber. After having passed a few years with small digital works for netlabels, Alphaxone progressively reached a name in the soothing, spacious, and subterranean ambient music field with solid releases welcomed by the key indie label Cryo Chamber (with Cyclic Law and Malignant this publisher figures among the strongest purveyor of industrial, droning, ritual and dark ambient efforts during the recent years.) What characterizes the usual sound architecture of Alphaxone’s production is the dominance of slowing moving textures, ecstatic, and chilling sonic waves obtained by vast assortments of electronic devices, synthesizers modules, and computer interfaces. Sustained chords, tranced-out oscillations and enveloping tones invite the listener to enter deep contemplative estates and join the inner tranquillity of his fundamental atmospheric self. If the sound signature admits schemas borrowed from space-music, the dark and tense vein is sometimes brought up to the fore with doom-laden bass frequencies and cavernous reverbs. Chronosphere is a pure and blissful transportive airy ambient album.

"Modular blips and bleeps surrounded by raw industrial flashes fully inhabit this exciting EP from Itai on the newly created TruthTable imprint (a sub-label of Audiobulb). The title track does just what you’d expect—with just over two and a half minutes, broken analog clangs flicker just above a heartbeat bassline. “Adream” floats by with an instrumental downtempo groove—guitars and scorched lyrics as its central vehicle. “Asleep” follows a similar path with further whispered vocals leading the way like Android Lust did back in the day. A highlight occurs in the crackling dark echoes of “The Greatest”—its synth-line and chorus is a contagious cacophony of beautiful noise that merits repeated listening. From the experimental electronic pop and swirling notes of “Lovesick Bombs,” to the muddy drums, rhythmic beauty, and acoustic guitar of “Gimme Candy,” this is a jam-packed extended player that only teases the listener with the artists’ knack of rugged analog electronics. As Itai “attempts to find that elusive place between wakefulness and sleep,” rest-assured that the cover artwork is perhaps the most spot-on depiction of this EP with its knobs and cables connected to a beating heart with a circuit-board built right in.Awake / Asleep is available on TruthTable.Awake / Asleep by Itai",articles20,"['Android Lust', 'Asleep', 'Itai']"
"I discovered this Ukrainian deep drone, power-industrial, and entrancing ambient combo back in 2016 with their mindblowing album The Rituals published for Malignant (2017). The project found a new home at Cyclic Law and Malignant—timeless underground indie labels and among finest purveyors of dark ambient oddities from iconic bands to promising newcomers in the genre.

"In 2016 Raderkraft founded Testlab Records, its first release a slab of cold electronics with a wave edge from his own hand. Willem Stinissen returns to the shelves of respectable record stores, this time on Belgium’s Die Blinden with Smart Control.Although the genetics of this latest quartet follows a similar line to Keine Richtung, there have been some obvious changes from that earlier sound. The title piece is an excellent example of this. Toeing the lines between proto-Kraftwerkian electro and future gazing wave, the track adopts stuttering number samples, icy cool synth-lines and broad sweeping keys to leave nothing but a sense of awe and a pretty broad smile. Simply sublime. “Sonne” is quite a cheery work. Playful keyboard work is intertwined by heavily vocodered lyrics and crisp beats in this fresh cut of robotic funk. “Hinter Den Bergen” is a more subdued affair. An understated melody skates on a frigid floor of hi-hats and gentle beats while words circle and fade. The speeding “Du Bist Meine” races to the finish line. Drum patterns spike in at 140 bpm as Raderkraft pours energy into a two-stepping, shoegazing, high impact curtain fall. Guttural vocals split and slice notes that spike, stab and swirl against a pulsing metronomic beat.There has been a pronounced development Stinissen’s sound. The fragile frosted forms of his first EP have been bolstered by new techniques and styles. Not only has Raderkraft refined his musical message, he has also broadened his audio palette. Undoubtedly emboldened by what can only be described as a herculean touring schedule, Smart Control is a crafted achievement from an artist who is honing his admirable craft.Smart Control is available on Die Blinden.",articles20,"['Smart Control', 'Stinissen’s', 'Undoubtedly']"
"A notable change in sound marks the fourth instalment in the De:Tuned 10th anniversary series. Whereas the past three have focused on techno past and present, this latest has wandered down another path; drum and bass.Blu Mar Ten open the two tracker with their 1996 work “Sandstorm.” Although the group, originally consisting of Chris Marigold and Leo Wyndham with Michael Tognarelli joining in 2004, are still producing music, this offering is a wonderful snapshot of their earlier compositions. A near eight minute journey, the track opens with shimmering chimes and watery echoes. Shot across this backdrop are rolling snares, fast and frenetic, that counter the lushness of arcing strings and brassy blasts. The flip is occupied by a different artist, yet the trip is somewhat similar. PFM, standing for Progressive Future Music, was originally made up of Jaime Staker and Mike Bolton with Staker leaving the duo at a latter date. Made in 1993, “Runaway” is one of the pairings’ earliest tracks. Slow and smooth to begin, an amen break lands like a bolt of thunder and once it lands it is there to stay. Sharp, energy packed beat patterns are mellowed by warm keys with female vocals adding a new uplifting layer. For those after something in the way of free jazz, Peshay’s “Live At 8.28” is available as a digital release.Although drum and bass has somewhat faded with time, elements of this trailblazing sound have found their way into a spread of other genres. Blu Mar Ten and PFM were pioneers of this style. These two tracks are emblematic of the complex percussion programming and absorbing harmonies that gripped audiences some twenty plus years ago, sounds that will still grab ears with the same fervour today as they did then.DE:10.04 is available on De:tuned.",articles20,"['Mike Bolton', 'Staker', 'Blu Mar Ten']"
"With the premise that UU is a concept album based on radioactive chemical elements, the prolific Signalstoerung (part of the Global Noise Movement and Adventurous Music) unleashes viceral electronic beauty once again for Hymen. Recall that 2018’s S was described as “confounding yet focused, S evolves and breaks down, its ebb and flow a muddy electronic wasteland”—UU floats in a similar stratosphere. Because of the extreme instability of these elements, some exist only for split seconds—nevertheless they release enormous power during their short lifespan. This, taken from the liner notes of the new release is important to note.On this seven track album, one can easily decipher that a uniform cohesion between each piece is very well orchestrated. There are moments of heavy echoes, broken beats fluttering in the background, rugged rhythms manipulated by ethereal bass lines, and eerie melodic strands coalesce throughout. These loosely connected pieces are both daunting and emotionally detailed (ref. “UUS,” and “UUQ” are two examples). “UUB,” on the other hand, elicits undulating low-end amid slow motion, downtempo percussion and drifting melodies to hold it together. This is where Signalstoerung expands the proverbial envelope—the use of low-pitched frequencies counteracted by delicate harmonies further opens the soundscapes that evolve on UU. If you recall seminal albums by Kattoo, Einoma, and Scorn—it’s quite easy to parallel Signalstoerung’s style to these ruggedly blissful soundtracks from another dimension.And just as this album opens itself to mysteriously fluid dark-electronic trajectories (some might observe as illbient), each piece is its own unique sonic element filled with character and control—ultimately connected by its audible siblings to form a large magnetically-charged bond.UU is available on Hymen.uu by signalstoerung",articles20,['Signalstoerung’s']
"Jake Mandell flew close to commercial success with his debut album, Parallel Processes, originally released on Worm Interface in 1998. He gained international acclaim for a record full of IDM details, glitch, scratch and a drum and bass (d’n’b) style. Mandell’s sound stood in between giants Aphex Twin, Autechre and Boards of Canada (BoC). As those three became pillars of the electronic music scene, Mandell’s focus changed as he went to work on some of the most cutting-edge audio software tools of the time, Reaktor and Native Instruments. His career now resides in medicine, though he’s recently made a comeback this year with a new album, Magnetic Resonance (Schematic, 2019) and this, Parallel Processes Plus, the re-release of the 1998 original, with five unreleased tracks from that same era.In 1998 IDM was lifting off. Aphex Twin were on the eve of commercial success and Autechre on the rise. BoC had landed on the scene too with Hi Scores 1996 with Skam (and reissued in 2014). Aphex Twin, Autechre and BoC—as we know them—had never been experienced by listeners before. It’s difficult to clearly understand how listeners first experienced these three during the 90s–but we know now that they impacted and later dominated the industry in ways unimaginable back then. Jake Mandell was clearly gripped by how Autechre, Aphex Twin and BoC sounded in Parallel Processes.Parallel Processes is a richly detailed album. Mandell didn’t just imitate Autechre, Aphex Twin or BoC track by track. He blended them all together, in all of these tracks. Each piece is an eccentric combination of those three artists’ traits. It’s arguable how much of Parallel Processes is meant to be listenable or a demonstration of creative ability. For producers, Parallel Processes is an album full of little sonic details to be delighted about. For listeners, Parallel Processes was likely not findable enough because it was in between styles, never staking a strong enough claim of its own. Even so, there’s something youthful and bold about Parallel Processes. It’s not self-conscious in how it moulds its inspirations together. It’s more brash and flamboyant and just doesn’t give a damn.Parallel Processes is a body of glitch, scratch, d’n’b, distortion and synth. Mid album track, “Last Night” is a highlight. It’s got a wonderful modulating and granular sequence moving it forward. “Tatter Shrags” is an eccentric blend of Autechre glitch and spooky sounding synths. “Ambitious Questaceon” is playful with a jumpy bass melody. Toward the final parts of the album, “Plic Plex” really ups the ante, with aggressive d’n’b breaks and dark sounding synths. “Dirthoe” changes the pace, jangling along with an oddball guitar melody. The album ends in a banger, final track “Rockslide” has distorted drums in an upbeat tempo alongside a grainy sounding melody.This is a large body of work laced with technical details, little experiments and flashy shows of creative flair. Yet, despite the intense detail, the album sounds the same most of the way through. The melodic synth palette is very much the same throughout. The percussive noises feel metallic and thin. That’s understandable, given the time it was made. Yet, surprising, the album being a massive 27 tracks and over 100 minutes long.As you frame Parallel Processes alongside its inspirations, it’s a powerful kickback to the heights of IDM. Current label, Bedroom Research are inspired by the impact it had when it was released 1998. It’s an album to escape into. A world of eccentric expression and sentiment. In 2019, Parallel Processes is still not a coherent record but delightfully unstable, eccentric and playful.Parallel Processes Plus is available on Bedroom Research.Parallel Processes Plus by Jake MandellParallel Processes Plus by Jake Mandell",articles20,"['Mandell’s', 'Parallel Processes', 'Autechre', 'Processes Plus']"
"Bones by Datach’i[Press-Release] Datach’i‘s new Eurorack modular album Bones for Timesig was announced earlier last week. The artwork has been designed by The Designers Republic with artist Heather Dale and the first 500 orders via the Mu Store or Bandcamp are bundled with a free 19 track Bonus album of exclusive tracks. In addition to this, customers buying Bones from Bandcamp and the Mu Store will be put into a lottery for a TipTop Audio ONE sampler modular that comes loaded with a Datach’i sample card. The track “4X1” on the album is made entirely from sounds on this card.Much like its predecessor, Bones manages to make the most of the possibilities modular systems offer, whilst avoiding their many pitfalls that can often turn such music into little more than a dry academic exercise. Indeed Bonesis a remarkably intimate album, written and recorded in the time following his father’s death, and reflects this intense period of personal change in Joseph’s life.“Creating this music was a therapy of sorts,” Joseph recalls. “It was almost like a close friend being there for me, and it’s something that I hope others can perhaps utilize in the same way.”The resulting album grapples with the intensity of these emotions. But for all their weight, tracks like “Saugerties Road,” “Rockledge 3A,” and “Antumalal” transform that heaviness into something warm and comforting whilst the aforementioned “Arrivals” or “Wand” ultimately achieve some kind of escape velocity and soar. Ranging from blissful ambience and guileless, starry eyed melodies, to intricate claustrophobic rhythms that forever sound close to collapsing in on themselves before expanding into bold new patterns, Bones is the work of a producer who, twenty years on from his debut, continues to push the boundaries of electronic music.Bones is available on Timesig July 26, 2019.

"YUYAY has developed into a bit of a “buy on sight” label. I’m not one to blow too much smoke, but this Leipzig imprint has certainly earned its stripes with a catalogue of daring electro from homegrown talent. The latest six tracker arrives care an unknown entity, Carl Y. Scheele‎, and his focus on Element #8.“Redox” balances a brooding dark bassline and jittery beats with playful keyboard noodling and innocent notes in a refreshing honest and unimposing piece. There is a light-hearted quality to the EP, a quality that shines in the bright bars of “Liquid Phlogiston” while being obscured in the creepy compufunk of “Red Vapors.”“Saline Principle Of Water” is an absolute show stopper. Broken beats are the foundation from which strings sail and soar with Scheele demonstrating another side of his wide sound. Softer tones are mixed with frosted keys for the finale. “Phosphorous Match” sails against a ambient backdrop, silken smoothness countered by squelchy notes and crisp drums.A whacky journey into tripped out electro was what I thought I was in for on the needle drop, but I was wrong. Element #8 is no fixed music state, no one genre, it is fluid. Instead, like the alchemists of the past, Carl Y. Scheele twists, pulls and reshapes as he picks and chooses from a range of styles to come at his very own. As the record inner sleeve says, “…we often talk about the same without even realising it.” Well said. Great sounding.Element #8 is available on YUYAY.Element #8 [YUY011] by Carl Y.
