"Martin Garrix returned to Ultra last night after taking a break from the festival in 2018 and he absolutely crushed his set. Coming back with his newly produced ANIMA show, Garrix performed for 80 intense minutes on the Ultra Music Festival main stage and had most jaws on the floor by the end of the show.For those of us watching the live stream, we were glued to our screens in awe. But more than the visuals, we also noticed a  of IDs thrown into the set, some possibly from Garrix himself and others forthcoming on his STMPD RCRDS imprint.Thankfully, the OGs at 1001tracklists already have a pretty comprehensive set list from the set last night and Mixcloud has the full set available to stream (Ultra will undoubtedly upload the full live stream set at a later time). Listening through the set again, it’s seamless and all about the sound that Garrix has cultivated in the past five years.IDs from Dyro, Martin Garrix & Seth Hills, and (maybe) Loopers have already been identified. Additionally, Garrix dropped “Mistaken” with Matisse & Sadko on Spotify just as soon as his set ended! See the full tracklist here.  IDslive streammain stageMartin Garrixsetstmpd recordsultra music festivalunreleasedLover of all bass music.

"deadmau5 took over Ultra Music Festival‘s Live Arena last night for a very special performance — the debut of his brand new-and-improved Cube 3.0. It was nothing short of spectacular and we have the footage to prove it.Instead of stationing himself atop the cube like we’ve come to expect, the producer’s control hub lies within the center of the design. More motorized than ever, Cube 3.0 actually swivels out to either side to reveal deadmau5 sitting in his gaming chair, pushed up to a desk, at work — like the boss he is.deadmau5 always goes above and beyond to make sure his live shows are worth the ticket. This new concept is no exception. As you can see from the videos below, the visuals are on point and the musical arrangements are flawless for this forthcoming ‘cube v3‘ tour.Watch below as deadmau5 debuts his Cube 3.0 for a worldwide audience. Also, see Lights join in on the action, as she assists in singing “Drama Free” and “Raise Your Weapon” live.

"UPDATE 3:54 PM PDT | Ultra has confirmed that Armin van Buuren will perform an extended set to replace Eric Prydz tonight.Earlier this week, Eric Prydz was forced to cancel his Ultra Music Festival sets due to undisclosed medical issues. Now, rumors are buzzing as to who might take his spot tonight on the ASOT stage ahead of Armin van Buuren.His first scheduled performance, a b2b as Cirez D shifted into a solo set by his counterpart, Adam Beyer. Makes sense. (Beyer’s set tonight, which was a solo set, is now a b2b with Maceo Plex.) Now, it’s rumored Porter Robinson will take his place as Virtual Self tonight on the ASOT stage. Seriously big shoes to fill in this case. But if anyone can do it — it’s Porter.A series of tweets back up this theory. However, these rumors are purely speculation at this point.  Stay tuned to see what happens.As Ultra powers forward with its final night, we wish Prydz a speedy recovery wherever he might be. He’ll be greatly missed tonight.Virtual Self is rumored to take Eric place at ultra for tonight… hmmm 🧐🤨— Panda (@DannyIsPaz) March 31, 2019Rumor around ultra is that virtual self is filling it for Eric Prydz!

"Despite rumors and intense desires from some to see Virtual Self, Porter Robinson’s more trance and house-leaning alias, take Eric Prydz’s spot at Ultra tonight, the festival has confirmed that Armin van Buuren will perform a special extended set to close out the festival.Prydz broke the news to fans this past Tuesday that he was cancelling all Miami appearances due to an “acute medical condition,” including his back-to-back set with Adam Beyer as Cirez D and his set at the A State of Trance stage on Sunday.Part of Armin’s set will be streamed live via UMF TV tonight at 12:00 AM EDT/9:00 PM PDT — you can watch it here. Be sure to follow along with the conversation at @youredm on Twitter.Regrettably, Eric Prydz is unable to be present for his performance today due to an acute medical condition.

"“Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites,” a Skrillex classic, is apparently a secret weapon against mosquito sex, according to a new study.The Aedes aegypti aka yellow fever mosquito is prone to carrying diseases, but the low frequencies heard in a dubstep song such as this can actually disrupt the mating process. As such, it could potentially block the spread of disease within these carriers.The study, published in describes observations that “such music can delay host attack, reduce blood feeding, and disrupt mating.” These findings provide “new avenues for the development of music-based personal protective and control measures against Aedes-borne diseases.”The experimental setup was rather straightforward. Researchers studied the mosquitoes in “music-on” and “music-off” environments. The “music-on” subjects were exposed to Skrillex’s “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.” As it turns out, the song is nature’s anti-aphrodisiac.More on the study here. diseasemosquitoResearchscary monsters and nice spritesScienceskrillexStudy",articles6,[None]
"Despite the myriad issues at the end of Ultra Music Festival’s first day, the music was excellent. Plenty of DJs played their hearts out to a crowd of tens of thousands on Virginia Key, with many being featured on Ultra’s live stream. Thankfully, we don’t have to wait to relive these epic moments or your favorite Ultra sets.Over on Mixcloud, sets from Tiësto, Alesso, Dog Blood, Nicky Romero, and more are available for replay and they’re well worth your time. Dog Blood easily had one of the best sets on stream yesterday, and Nicky Romero honestly truly surprised us with how much we enjoyed his set. Alesso brought back the classics, and Tiesto played loads of new music.Check out all of the available sets below — we’ll update it with more as they become available! Rukes.com alessoDog Bloodlive setsmarshmellonicky romerotiestoultra music festivalultra setsLover of all bass music.

"NGHTMRE & Slander brought Gud Vibrations to the main stage at Ultra Music Festival today and they brought along some huge guests, as well! Toward the middle of the set, they brought out SHAQ and then Lil Jon for a series of tracks that must have had the crowd thinking, “This can’t be f*cking real.”But it gets even better — while Lil Jon stayed on stage, SHAQ went down into the crowd and actually  at Ultra. I know this is something that keeps being said, but it really does feel like the simulation broke at some point and we’re now living in some kind of crumbling approximation of the real thing.That being said, if the simulation truly is broken and this is the result, I don’t know if I want it getting fixed.You can see moment like this and more if you watch the live stream here and follow us on Twitter at @YourEDM..@NGHTMRE and @SlanderOfficial just brought out @SHAQ on @Ultra's main stage 😱🔊 if you're not watching live, you're missing it! https://t.co/UobHBGru2x #UltraMiami2019 pic.twitter.com/Y0qt7ukHDr— Your EDM (@YourEDM) March 30, 2019I can't even… @SHAQ is moshing in the crowd at @ultra, what is happening??? 😂😂😂@NGHTMRE + @SlanderOfficial are throwing tf down pic.twitter.com/rvi1EsZy7K— Your EDM (@YourEDM) March 30, 2019 gud vibrationsLil JonMosh Pitshaqsimulationultra music festivalLover of all bass music.

"Ultra Music Festival experienced a logistical nightmare on the first day when traffic and an apparent accident held up shuttles for hours. Thousands were forced to walk the causeway from Virginia Key to Miami proper to get home for the night, only compounding the issue.Apparently, the second day was much more organized in terms of flow. Some waited it out and others took to foot again as the more attractive option to surge pricing or waiting an hour or two for a shuttle. Still, it was a huge improvement over night one.It sounds like festival organizers are doing everything they can to get over 50,000 people off the island each night. However, when everyone tends to leave at once, it does present a problem.Ultra put out an official statement following the chaos of the first night, calling the issues “unacceptable and inconsistent with the high standards you have come to expect from us.” Organizers also shared an updated exit strategy, including some after hours programming to help stagger the amount of people leaving, including a special Afrojack set at the UMF Radio stage at 2am.As always, there are mixed reviews. But, overall, it seems attendees are satisfied with the shuttle situation. See the tweets below.P.S. If you’re out at Ultra, keep in mind that the festival is now offering “post-2 am activities including@ultra Transportation looks more organized today for sure but we left Martin Garrix's set 15 minutes early and we just got on the bus 2 hours later. Unfortunately, walking the bridge still seems the better option. #UltraMiami2019 pic.twitter.com/pVk2euZDAo— SAbdul (@rilipinoy) March 31, 2019Thank you @ultra for unfucking the shuttle situation #UltraMiami2019 #ultra5k— Jason Garcia (@jdogshouse123) March 31, 2019got home in 30 mins from the shuttle thank you @ultra for actually fixing things, goodnight— mk8 drift queen 🏎 (@iriskhung) March 31, 2019Credit where it’s due, the shuttle organization for @ultra was significantly improved last night.

"Ultra Music Festival didn’t have the smoothest first day. A logistical nightmare took place as soon as Marshmello’s closing set was wrapping up. This left thousands stranded — unable to jump on a shuttle, many walked the causeway to the mainland.Festival organizers already issued a formal response, stating that the ordeal was “unacceptable and inconsistent with the high standards you have come to expect from us.” As promised, Ultra has a reinforced plan to make sure attendees have a smooth transportation experience today and moving forward.Here are the specific actions Ultra is taking, per the post below:We have been hard at work ensuring a smooth transportation experience for your trip home after the festival tonight….Posted by Ultra Music Festival on Saturday, March 30, 2019 ExitMaptransportationultra 2019ultra music festivalumfvirginia keyWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Technical difficulties at shows happen, and they suck. However, the mark of a true artist is how you adapt and respond to these difficulties, and unfortunately for Cash Cash, the deck was stacked against them.The trio went on the main stage at Ultra Music Festival at 5:05 PM local time and the equipment quickly took a turn for the worse. According to a source on the scene, the group’s mixer began to fail after exposure to pyrotechnics on the stage. After the mixer completely failed, a different source tells Your EDM that one of the group members apparently threw the mixer off the stage toward the crowd in frustration.Cash Cash’s set was reportedly down for approximately 20 minutes while festival staff replaced the faulty mixer — the group has been going strong on the live stream ever since. You can watch it here.Ultimately, our sources say there’s no bad blood between the festival and Cash Cash for the act and they’re continuing their set without any further issues.More problems at @ultra 😂😂Cash Cash chucking a CDJ off stage after power cuts three times!!!— Daniel Rodger (@DanielRodger) March 30, 2019cash cash壊れたミキサーぶん投げたわww— Asahi🍕 (@asahi_garrixer) March 30, 2019Wtf is going on @ultra I’m trying to listen to @cashcash on @UMFradio and I can’t even jam with all the technical fuck ups.

"KFC played a set at Ultra Music Festival yesterday and DJs are sounding off about it.Days ago, KFC took to Twitter to announce that DJ Colonel Sanders would take the stage — not just any stage mind you, but the Main Stage — at Ultra Miami. Here’s what the brand wrote:From the beginning, this entire stunt has been pretty cheesy. Even yesterday’s headliner, Marshmello called KFC’s set “lame.” The main argument against DJ Colonel Sanders amongst popular DJs is the fact that there are plenty up-and-coming artists deserving of the spot. And, they’re absolutely right.Various DJs describe the “Ultra Fast Food Festival” stunt as a “rip on rave culture,” “Disneyland corporate level shit,” and just flat out “tacky.” Extra crispy or not — for many in the industry, this is hard to stomach.Colonel Sanders @ Ultra Music Festival [Full Set]So, Colonel Sanders set at Ultra Music Festival was… interesting 🤔Posted by Your EDM on Friday, March 29, 2019See some of the conversation below and let us know what you think…Sorry bro we did the edm chicken thing before you— habstrakt (@habstrakt) March 30, 2019This @kfc colonel sanders Djing at @ultra is lame.

There’s been a rumor going around that Garrix is bringing his ANIMA show to Ultra this year, based on images of his iconic + LED panel during load-in. If that turns out to be the case, then tonight we’ll get to see the Ultra main stage at a level that no other DJ will bring it.You can watch Martin Garrix from the Ultra main stage below!Opening show: 5:00 PM

"Well, Day 2 of Ultra Music Festival is a wrap and what a day it was. The live stream was a full hour longer on Day 2 to afford for Martin Garrix’s full headlining set in addition to the worldwide debut of Deadmau5’s Cube 3.0 which was presented with a delay.NGHTMRE and Slander brought out Shaq and Lil Jon, and then NGHTMRE rushed over to the live stage to debut the first performance of Gigantic NGHTMRE, his collaboration with Big Gigantic. Illenium absolutely murdered the live stage, and Zedd brought his digestible pop/EDM combo to the main stage. Armin van Buuren also proved why he’s been booked at Ultra every year since 2008 with a set for the ages.Martin Garrix, however, completely stole the show closing out the main stage on Day 2 with his incredible ANIMA production and  of new IDs both from himself and others on STMPD RCRDS.Check out all the live sets from the stream yesterday below!

"Ultra Music Festival finally begins today, after months of waiting and lots of press surrounding the festival and its new home on Virginia Key. What happens this weekend remains to be seen in terms of logistics and attendee satisfaction, but, as always, the lineup is one thing fans never, ever have to worry about with this festival.The UMF.TV live stream will be going all day today as per usual; however, with the new, expanded times of the festival, it will be starting two hours later and ending three hours later. This means that those of us on the west coast will be glued to our TVs and monitors until 11 PM PDT rather than the usual 8 PM.An Opening Ceremony will kick off the live stream today at 5:00 PM EDT, followed by an assortment of DJs including SOPHIE, Tom Morello, Louis The Child, Tiesto, Alesso, Dog Blood, and Marshmello.We don’t recommend missing any of these, because who knows who any of these artists might bring out! Marshmello especially…If you’re trying to see every single artist on the live stream today, sorry to disappoint. There’s only so much real estate and some acts aren’t making it. Apart from Dog Blood, none of the Ultra Worldwide acts will make it on the stream. None of the artists at UMF Radio will be on the stream, either. SOPHIE, Tom Morello, and Louis The Child will pop in for 20 minutes each, but the majority of the stream is squarely focused on the main stage this year.Art Department and Carl Cox are the only artists from Resistance that will make it on the main stream, though each will only be on for 10 minutes. (Resistance has its own separate stream here.) Given Ultra’s track record with such short live stream sets, it’s doubtful we’ll really even get to see any of them.Watch the whole live stream from Day 1 below!Friday, March 23: 5 PM – 2 AM

"Everyone took notice of the Ultra set times via the app when it was revealed that none other than KFC founder Colonel Sanders was set to perform on the main stage. It’s easily one of the strangest bookings we’ve ever seen, and we have a lot of questions.Sanders was supposed to be on the live stream, but as it’s running about 20 minutes late right now, it cut straight from Matoma to SOPHIE at the Live Arena.

And hot damn — does it sound amazing. Ty Dolla’s smooth flow matched with a rhythmic house drop is exactly what we’re living for in 2019.Brownies & Lemonade was there to capture the moment (obviously, it was their party) — so luckily we can replay this moment over and over again.

"It’s getting really hard to predict what The Chainsmokers are going to do next, and that’s working entirely in their favor. After putting out a lackluster debut album, they brought it back with , using intelligent lyrics and mixing in a diverse array of pop and EDM. Now, the group is dropping singles from its third album  and it’s pretty damn pop so far.The Chainsmokers dropped a new song today called “Kills You Slowly” that plays like a mumble rappers attempt at a ballad, at least as far as rhythm goes. The subtle melody and in-your-face 808 snares in the chorus also help to add to that effect.Overall, it’s absolutely one of the slowest and most stripped down songs that The Chainsmokers have ever put out. There’s no grand production or crazy effects to mask any shortcomings in the song, and there are a couple. But there’s no way to deny that this group is forging its own path in the pop/EDM crossover sphere and they’re succeeding.The Chainsmokers will close out Ultra Music Festival this Sunday, March 31, at 12:30 PM EDT. Listen to “Kill You Slowly” below.[Verse 1]
Made plans with me and all your friends
I’m late again, I hate to keep you waiting
Tried to be a gentleman, got drunk again before I even made it
Tried to call a car for you, you’re tired of me, I know you wouldn’t take it
You walked a mile in Louis Vuittons and fucked ’em up, you know that they’re my favourite[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we’re good again
I do things I can’t defend
And even when you hold it in[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hitting when we’re in the open
Keep on smilin’ until it’s over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly[Verse 2]
Arguments that never end, you’re talkin’ shit to spice up conversation
I’m so sick of back and forth, these fights with you are startin’ to feel contagious
Said that I’m no good for you right before we walk into your parents
Then you put on that smile again and grab my hand even though you hate it[Pre-Chorus]
But we dress up and play pretend
Then we act like we’re good again
I do things I can’t defend
And even when you hold it in[Chorus]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hitting when we’re in the open
Keep on smilin’ until it’s over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly[Post-Chorus]
Oh but, but it it, won’t but, I said
You hold on, hopin’ it gon’ stop, but it don’t
Oh but, but it it, won’t but, I said
You hold on, hopin’ it gon’ stop, but it don’t[Bridge]
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly
Explosions hitting when we’re in the open
And keep on smilin’ until it’s over
Hold it, even though it kills you slowly[Chorus]
Holdin’ even though it kills you slowly (Oh but, but it it, won’t but, I said, you hold on, hopin’ it gon’ stop, but it don’t)

"Ultra is officially open and the stages are playing, but not all that glitters is gold. An hour ago, Jai Wolf revealed that he’s been forced to pull out of the festival due to “unforeseen logistical issues.” It’s unclear if these issues have to do with his stage or something else entirely, but that’s the long and short of it.Jai Wolf was scheduled to play at UMF Radio for the Foreign Family Collective takeover tonight at 11:15 PM.This makes the second cancellation for the festival, whether for health or other reasons. Eric Prydz was forced to withdraw from all Miami appearances earlier this week due to health concerns.pic.twitter.com/MOEaQrXOOi— Jai Wolf (@JaiWolfx) March 29, 2019In addition, the main stage went dark as power completely went out around 3 PM local time as Dzeko was scheduled to take the stage.

"Attendees making their way toward the exits at Ultra Music Festival last night were met with a tree that had caught on fire. Security was ushering attendees away from the area, which was already congested due to issues with the shuttles, as the fire department rushed to quell the flames.Reports are that embers from a firework caused the fire, but it has not been confirmed. Regardless, Miami Commissioner Ken Russell has said that Ultra will not use fireworks for the remainder of the weekend.“The fire itself seemed to have taken place between the stage and the causeway,” he said.No one was injured.This, following a pledge by the festival that no wildlife would be harmed. Ultra’s attorney Rafe Petersen stated on Thursday, “[…] the event organizers remain committed to environmental protection and will implement numerous environmental mitigation measures as well as a sustainability plan that will ensure the protection of Virginia Key.”I guess no more fireworks for @ultra pic.twitter.com/FSTHDoGUbm— mycayla 🌻🌿🌊 (@Mycaylaaa_) March 30, 2019Fire caused by the fireworks at ultra!

"Tens of thousands of attendees all tried to exit Ultra Music Festival at once last night after Marshmello finished his set at 2am EDT. Predictably, this caused a logistical nightmare at the shuttle stops which was only compounded by traffic and an apparent accident that forced attendees to walk the causeway home. Their alternative options were to wait hours for a shuttle, or pay exorbitant fees for an Uber or Lyft. Many people who left the festival after it concluded report not getting back to their hotels or Airbnbs until close to 6am.This morning, Ultra Music Festival released an official statement, calling the issues “unacceptable and inconsistent with the high standards you have come to expect from us.”Ultra’s statement continues to say that they’ve been working with the city to actively improve conditions, as it’s in everyone’s best interest to avoid a repeat of the events of night one, which also included a fire on the premises that required swift action by the fire department. That, in addition to everything else, also contributed to the gridlock on the causeway.“Changes to the transportation plan are being implemented today,” Miami Commissioner Ken Russell said in a statement. “I’m hopeful that plan will be much improved and the City will not have more of a disruption than experienced yesterday and early this morning.”OFFICIAL STATEMENT:Last night, many of you experienced challenging transportation conditions leaving the festival….Posted by Ultra Music Festival on Saturday, March 30, 2019  issuesshuttlesstatementtransportationultraultra 2019ultra fyreultra music festivalultra shuttlesLover of all bass music.

"Playing at Ultra Music Festival, especially on the main stage, is an honor not bestowed to many. At most, maybe a dozen or so new acts will play the stage each year while the regularly recurring acts like Fedde Le Grand, Tiësto, David Guetta, and Afrojack continue to lay claim to their slots. So when one of those slots is taken up as a gimmick, some DJs take notice.Colonel Sanders played the main stage this afternoon at Ultra and it was an… interesting experience. The roughly four minute set was as entertaining as it was confusing, watching a helmet-clad person dance around and promote a fried chicken restaurant.It seems, however improbable, that Marshmello actually took issue with the booking.“This  colonel sanders Djing at  is lame,” he tweeted. “I can think of a lot of other artists that actually deserve to be on that stage instead.”This @kfc colonel sanders Djing at @ultra is lame. I can think of a lot of other artists that actually deserve to be on that stage instead.— marshmello (@marshmellomusic) March 29, 2019Now, I’m not ruling out the possibility that this tweet was tongue in cheek — it’s my opinion that it probably was. I’m not even ruling out the possibility that it was actually Marshmello under that Col. Sanders helmet. We have no way of knowing it wasn’t.But, let’s say, for argument’s sake, that he was being serious. The set was five minutes, hardly a time slot that another artist might “deserve.” Overall, it took no time out of Ultra’s schedule and it made for a catchy headline and story to take home to mom, dad, and friends.So what do you think? Is Marshmello being serious? Is he really the one under that helmet? Or is this completely in jest? Let us know. call outcolonel sandersconspiracykfcmarshmellosarcasmTweetultraWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Ultra Music Festival is in the middle of a lot of hot water this morning.Fans leaving late from the venue took to the internet to voice their frustrations over the shuttle transports not reaching them. Facebook posts and tweets of attendees walking over three miles on one of Miami’s most prolific causeways began to flood social media sites in viral fashion.This weekend, Ultra Music Festival has been hosting what they describe their “new chapter” at Miami Marine Stadium and the Historic Virginia Key Beach Park. After a full day of incredible performances from electronic musicians, artists, and DJs, Ultra experienced issues with transportation reaching pick-up stations to take attendees from Virginia Key to locations between Downtown Miami and Coconut Grove.However, as attendees made their way to be picked up by the shuttles, they experienced a growing delay from the transportation. Some UMF attendees were picked up and whisked off the island (albeit through an abundance of traffic), but others who waited for hours learned that all the corresponding shuttle pick-up locations were not seeing any buses picking attendees up but one. This lone shuttle pick-up spot became bloated with fans to the point that attendees who didn’t leave past 11:30pm would be in for a long night.As time passed, the line was in trouble. It became longer, more disorganized and people were wearing their impatience on their face. Other attendees began walking towards the Rickenbacker Causeway (the only way into and out of Key Biscayne) to not have to deal with the delayed shuttles. To make matters worse, attendees were told by security and police that they could not walk to and cross the Rickenbacker Causeway and that they had to take the shuttles to leave Virginia Key. This meant that tens of thousands of people were stuck at Ultra Music Festival and had to be lucky enough to be able to get into a bus while maintaining their parties and exhaustion from the day.But then things got ugly.Fireworks from the final main stage performance of the day by Marshmello might have been the cause of a fire that engulfed a palm tree near the one shuttle pick-up station. Attendees initially told by authorities to back-up closer to the festival and away from traffic immediately scattered away from the flames and towards the causeway. Outnumbered authorities gave way as Ultra’s tens of thousands of fans walked about three miles across the Rickenbacker Causeway. Meanwhile, shuttles, taxis, and any other vehicle on the causeway were gridlocked for hours on the road and bridge attendees were walking to get back home.Posts like the one from @Tidoublemy8 showed video of fans walking over the bridge as it became what many referred to as the only viable and realistic option to leave Virginia Key.Tens of thousands of people leaving @Ultra to walk 3 miles across a bridge (blocking traffic) because it was the only realistic option. Cabs weren’t running, uber was restricted, and shuttle lines were hours long. Terrible planning! An embarrassment. #ultra2019 #fyrefestival pic.twitter.com/vjoC6fFOd5— Tidoublemy (@Tidoublemy8) March 30, 2019Others online took to lampooning whatever they could over Ultra’s transportation issues.the PR department for Ultra rn. pic.twitter.com/yp8xwWCHNP— savvy savage 🐇🍄 (@savpardo) March 30, 2019 Everyone at Ultra rn pic.twitter.com/qsWoUGEBfF— Diego (@_diegolv_) March 30, 2019Many attendees left as late as 4am when the event had ended two hours earlier. And those in vehicles in Virginia Key remained put through unmoving traffic. Some attendees even considered selling their tickets for the rest of the weekend, not only from the fatigue that came with walking the far distance, but also due to Ultra’s logistical issues.“Changes to the transportation plan are being implemented today,” Miami Commissioner Ken Russell said in a statement. “I’m hopeful that plan will be much improved and the City will not have more of a disruption than experienced yesterday and early this morning.”Stephanie Bromfield, a media relations coordinator at Ultra, said festival organizers met with municipal and emergency service officials on Saturday morning ahead of a planned press conference to be held before noon near Miami Marine Stadium.  causewayfailuremiamishuttlestransportationultraultra music festivalultra shuttlesMusic enthusiast would be an understatement.

"It’s been six years since Skrillex and Boys Noize released music together as Dog Blood. They’re finally back with an energetic new single that’s perfect in every possible way.The duo spawned two EPs over 2012 and 2013, with tracks including “Next Order,” “Middle Finger,” and the especially savage “Shred Or Die.” Their new one, “Turn Off The Lights,” feels lighter at surface level, but it remains true to what we’ve come to expect of the Dog Blood project.A classic rave-worthy build, mad drum rhythms, and catchy vocal chops make the new Dog Blood single easily digestible for the average ear — but just wait for that heavy, stuttered breakdown at 2:52. It’s fleeting for sure, but just enough to give Dog Blood diehards exactly what they want.The duo recently played Buku Music + Arts Festival together, uniting as Dog Blood. See the footage from their high-octane performance here. They played last night at the Brownies & Lemonade show in Miami, and they’ll play again tonight at Ultra Music Festival on the WorldWide stage at 11:30 PM EDT.“Turn Off The Lights” is out now via OWSLA / Boysnoize Records.https://DogBlood.lnk.to/TOTLPR boys noizeDog BloodskrillexTurn Off The Lights",articles6,"['Noize', 'Dog Blood', 'Dog Blood']"
"Ultra Miami is about to go down this weekend at its new home on Virginia Key. Which also happens to be the same home for protected wildlife including manatees, birds, crocodiles, and more. Non-profit Miami Waterkeeper and other environmentalists have raised concerns, but the music festival insists it will do no harm to the animals.Addressing the concerns, Ultra reps previously outlined the measures being taken over the weekend. Styrofoam, plastic straws, and other single-use plastics like cups, balloons, confetti, and streamers have been prohibited. Cocktails will be served in paper or compostable cups. The festival will introduce more water stations in hopes to keep 227,375 water bottles off the premises.According to Ultra, there will be fences around beaches and other sensitive areas for protection. Pocket ashtrays will be distributed. Alternates to fireworks with less debris will be used during the show. Finally, noise-mitigation will be implemented at some stages.This is all a step in the right direction, but is it enough? Miami Waterkeeper’s executive director, Rachel Silverstein, describes the efforts as “completely insufficient.” She warns the music festival could have an impact on wildlife, which may be adversely affected by loud music. Her case argues the event could even violate state and federal laws that ban the harassment of threatened or endangered species.The response from Ultra’s attorney Rafe Petersen: Miami Waterkeeper’s reply via Miami New Times: Ultra continues to focus on its “leave no trace” policy.If you’re heading out to the festival, be extra aware of the environment surrounding the venue and please pick up after yourselves. Miami New Times endangeredenvironmentleave no traceultraultra miamiultra music festivalwildlifeWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"For 1788-L, 2018 was characterized by a seemingly endless barrage of new tracks week after week, month to month. There was hardly ever more than three weeks between new tracks from February through August, when he released his debut EP on Deadbeats, . Since then, if you just look at his Instagram, it’s been one festival or show announcement after another.Finally, the pendulum seems to be swinging back to music. A new collaboration with Ekali, “RUIN,” was released earlier this year, and now we have word that a full EP is coming from him in less than a month’s time. The news comes direct from Miami, where fans could see a banner flying overhead that reads, in no uncertain terms: “New EP out on Deadbeats 4/26.”No word yet on how many tracks there will be, but we know that 1788-L has collaborations done with Kayzo, Slooze, Josh Pan, Zeds Dead, blanke, and Deathpact.

"Billboard Dance just unleashed its 100 Artists of 2019 and it’s 100% stacked from top to bottom.Marshmello reigns at the #1 spot. He’s followed by Calvin Harris, The Chainsmokers, Zedd, and Kygo rounding out the top 5. Martin Garrix, Diplo, Tiësto, DJ Snake and David Guetta fill out the top 10. The list also includes Skrillex, Flume, deadmau5, Illenium, and many more.The publication took into account nearly a quarter of a million votes from 174 countries and all 7 continents. That, stats from domestic and global charts including streaming, track sales, album sales, and radio airplay, plus touring data including show capacities, festival bookings, and residencies all went into deciding the Top 100.Charting on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs and Top Dance/Electronic Albums served as a general baseline for eligibility. Billboard’s staff also worked to ensure the list remained true to the dance/electronic music community, by considering each artist’s history and context. As a result, the list is pretty comprehensive.Alison Wonderland, Rezz, and Tokimonsta grace the covers of the special Billboard Dance issue, all of whom made the list.

Unfortunately, the best and only video we’ve seen is only 8 seconds long. At the same time, it’s all the proof we need that this happened and it was glorious.Skrillex and What So Not have collaborated on tracks “Goh” and “Waiting” and whenever they work together it’s all ears and eyes on them.According to the source, they threw down a lot of music from The Prodigy and it was a mood.

"Billboards appearing in Miami over the weekend have suggested that the annual EDC festival in Florida will expand to three days in 2019.EDC Orlando has been a 2-day festival since it was introduced to Insomniac’s roster back in 2011. It has been held at Tinker Field every year, with tens of thousands of attendees coming through each year. 2019 would mark the first year that the festival adopts a 3-day schedule, which would accommodate for more attendees over the weekend, as well as more acts on the lineup.According to the billboard, EDC Orlando will go down November 8, 9, and 10 this year.Insomniac founder and CEO Pasquale Rotella confirmed the news. 🔥🙌 I’m excited to announce that EDC Orlando 2019 is expanding from 2 to 3 DAYS this year!! Yup, it’s official. For 8 years we’ve been building something magical and now we’ll be going all weekend long with MORE stages, MORE artists, LARGER production, and a BIGGER festival footprint! 💪😎 Also, gotta thank all our East Coast Headliners that showed up to make EDC Orlando so amazing last year.

"Eric Prydz was scheduled for three shows in Miami this week: a Pryda show at Wynwood Factory, and two Ultra sets — one on Friday with Adam Beyer, and on Sunday at ASOT.Unfortunately, as he revealed yesterday, all sets will be cancelled as he’s unable to travel due to an “acute medical condition.”Ultra has made no mention of the sudden cancellation on social media, but are sure to be working on getting a replacement, especially for his set on Sunday as he plays right before Armin van Buuren. His b2b with Adam Beyer on Friday, where he’d play as his Cirez D alias, will more than likely continue with Beyer solo.While this is definitely sad news, we’re sure that Prydz will make a full recovery in time for EDC in May, and that Ultra will manage without him.I am really sorry but due to an acute medical condition I am unable to travel or perform in Miami this week.

"It was only last week that Flume revealed his  mixtape to the world, and he’s already back today with new music. Revealed first on triplej is “Friends” with Reo Cragun.“Friends” is at odds with all of the tracks on the mixtape last week, presenting a more pop-leaning influence. In an AMA on /r/Flume earlier today, he revealed he would be making music from “both ends of the spectrum” — best of all, it still sounds absolutely amazing and just like Flume.During Flume’s interview on triplej, he was reticent to mention if another full album was coming out this year, but mentioned that he’d be putting out music more steadily in 2019. He took time off as he’d been touring and putting out music and it was making him tired.“I was working so hard and started to hate music/touring. 6yrs of putting work before my happiness,” he revealed on reddit. “I needed to live a normal life for a bit.”Listen to “Friends” below.

"Justin Bieber is one of the most successful artists of the modern era. He’s one of only two artists with four songs with more than one billion streams on Spotify (and his fifth is only a little more than 300,000 away). He’s also one of the most publicized musicians, even at the young age of 25.However, an individual can only endure that much scrutiny and pressure for so long. Bieber has announced via social media that he is taking a hiatus from music to focus on “repairing some of the deep rooted issues that I have,” as well as his marriage. He also mentions he wants to “be the father I want to be” — it’s unclear if this is acknowledgement that his wife, Hailey Baldwin, is pregnant, or some vow for the future.This all being said, Bieber says he “will come with a kick ass album ASAP,” so don’t write him off entirely.Read his full statement below: So I read a lot of messages saying you want an album .. I’ve toured my whole teenage life, and early 20s, I realized and as you guys probably saw I was unhappy last tour and I don’t deserve that and you don’t deserve that, you pay money to come and have a lively energetic fun light concert and I was unable emotionally to give you that near the end of the tour. I have been looking, seeking, trial and error as most of us do, I am now very focused on repairing some of the deep rooted issues that I have as most of us have, so that I don’t fall apart, so that I can sustain my marriage and be the father I want to be. Music is very important to me but Nothing comes before my family and my health. I will come with a kick ass album ASAP, my swag is undeniable and my drive is indescribable his love is supernatural his grace is that reliable…. the top is where I reside period whether I make music or not the king said so. 👑 but I will come with a vengeance believe that..

For instance, you might have heard Green Velvet twice in yesterday’s mix — that’s because he’s playing once with Claude VonStroke as Get Real, and another time as Green Velvet Presents La La Land. Or, in another case, the many b2b sets, such as the absolutely unheard of Skream! b2b Rusko old school dubstep set.Moving right on ahead, North America’s largest dance music festival will deliver on its kineticENERGY theme with momentous performances across eight iconic stages from the likes of Alesso, Alison Wonderland, Armin Van Buuren, Dillon Francis, Diplo, Illenium, Kaskade, Martin Garrix, and Tiësto. Jamie Jones, Green Velvet & Claude VonStroke’s Get Real, and Gorgon City b2b CamelPhat will bring the house and underground sounds to kineticFIELD for the first time ever, while David Guetta returns to EDC Las Vegas for his first performance at the festival since 2012.Golden Globe, SAG, and Critics Choice award-winning actor Idris Elba will be playing back-to-back with Solardo at the neonGARDEN, while Ferry Corsten will return as “System F” after an epic 2018 debut. Making his first domestic EDC appearance since 2010, Deadmau5 brings along his new cube 3.0 stage, while artists including Amelie Lens and Zhu — also under his dark Blacklizt alias — make their EDC debuts. Famed rapper, producer, actor and model, A$AP Rocky, will showcase the best in hip-hop during a special performance at cosmicMEADOW.In addition to the previously announced Oasis Pool takeovers at Camp EDC, featuring Bassrush Records on May 17, HARD Recs on May 18, and Insomniac Records on May 19, the full roster of artists providing the soundtrack to EDC Las Vegas 2019 includes: 2019 edc lineupannouncementedcedc las vegasedc lineupedc lineup 2019insomniac eventslas vegaslineupNight Owl RadioLover of all bass music.

"Insomniac isn’t shy about dropping the lineup for their flagship festival EDC Las Vegas frightfully close to showdate. It was dropped 43 days prior in 2015, and only 24 days prior in 2016 — it started getting dropped sooner after 2017, but it’s still quite like sitting on the edge of one’s seat waiting for it.Thankfully, Insomniac CEO & founder Pasquale Rotella has shaved off a portion of our anxiety by announcing that the lineup for EDC Las Vegas is coming this week, a little less than two months from show date. Hopefully it comes before Friday when everyone is tuned into the Ultra Music Festival live stream — we still have three full days before that happens, though.Apart from the news of the EDC lineup, the picture of the whiteboard behind Rotella also gives away a few tasty news items about Insomniac’s festival lineup the rest of the year. It seems HARD Day of the Dead will be coming back, as well as Audiotistic SoCal. There’s also some new, previously unheard of festival called “La La Land.” No information on this one yet, but we’re sure it’s to come soon.Keep checking back this week to be alerted when the EDC lineup is getting dropped!Gettin’ geared up for line up reveal this week 😎💜🔥 @edc_lasvegas pic.twitter.com/BY3TQMACgy— Pasquale Rotella (@PasqualeRotella) March 25, 2019  announcementdroppingedc las vegasinsomniaclineuppasquale rotellateaserLover of all bass music.

"As last year’s installment of Ultra Miami approached, an imminent Swedish House Mafia reunion was all we had on our minds. Back then, we could have never imagined the extent of the group’s full-fledged comeback. One year later, it’s amazing to reminisce on the memorable set, but even more exciting knowing what’s still to come.Swedish House Mafia’s heartfelt reunion at Ultra Music Festival proved to be one of those iconic live sets that shall be remembered over a lifetime. Now, Steve Angello, Axwell, and Sebastian Ingrosso have an ambitious schedule ahead of them, with a full list of festival tour dates and special performances.In 2019, SHM has already locked in headlining spots at some of the biggest music festivals in the world — Ultra Korea, Ultra Europe, Weekend Festival, Lollapalooza Berlin, Creamfields and more. Kicking off a new era with a 3-day run in Stockholm this May, the group will soon hit the festival circuit again with 16 total shows (and counting).With all this on the horizon, let’s not forget what a phenomenal closing Ultra set SHM delivered us with last year. As songs like “Don’t You Worry Child,” “Save the World,” and “Miami 2 Ibiza” rang out into the hot Miami night — for the first time in a while, life was a little more simple. They even sprinkled in a couple of IDs that have yet to be revealed, but we can feel them coming.There’s a lot to look forward to this year with Swedish House Mafia back in action!

"The Chainsmokers released their debut album in 2017, . Widely regarded as very middling in terms of quality, it was rumored that The Chainsmokers were rushed to get a debut album out by their label after intense desire from fans. Learning from their past mistakes, the duo began releasing a track every month (for the most part) in 2018, culminating in their sophomore album, .Now in 2019, The Chainsmokers are already teasing their third album: , which is also spawning a North American arena tour of the same name. They’ve already released the first single from the album, “Who Do You Love” featuring 5SOS.With three months already gone in 2019 and nine tracks blacked out on the album tracklist, we can safely expect there to be one track a month from the group moving forward this year.Stay tuned for more from The Chainsmokers coming soon!2 0 1 9Posted by The Chainsmokers on Tuesday, March 26, 2019 Rukes.com albumannouncementThe Chainsmokersthird albumtracklistWho Do You Loveworld war joyLover of all bass music.

"Miami Music Week officially kicks off today ahead of Ultra Music Festival this weekend. While it would be nice to believe in a utopian society where drugs aren’t used to enjoy music, it’s not the reality in which we live. As a consequence, drugs are frequently used to augment one’s experience — and in Miami, a major center of the cocaine trade in the United States, the white powder is frightfully common.In a joint operation between 12 separate Coast Guard interceptions, around 27,000 pounds of cocaine was seized last Friday trying to enter Miami. It was worth an estimated $360 million.“If you catch it by the tons, you do not have to chase it by the kilos in the streets of Miami,” a Coast Guard spokesman said.The cocaine was seized by six different Coast Guard cutters.“Getting this amount of drugs takes a collaborative effort,” Lt. Mike Massaro said.See Your EDM’s guide to MMW here.Here's what 27,000 lbs of seized cocaine looks like. All will be offloaded by the @USCG Cutter Tampa today in Miami Beach FL, and sent for destruction #notonourstreets.

"Malaa was arrested mid-set at Bassmnt in San Diego last night — and fans are sounding off whether it was real or fake. With his bad boy appeal and  mixtapes, this totally fits his image either way.In the videos below, Malaa seems to be going about his usual business when cops come up from behind him, the music is cut off, and he’s forced off the stage. The masked DJ is rushed out of there before anyone really knows what happened.The arrest is captured from multiple angles, from the crowd and the most telling one from backstage. As fans on Twitter have pointed out, it looks like one of the cops involved is known for performing fake arrests.This is probably one of the most Malaa thing we have ever heard, which just screams publicity stunt.

"A new report from the the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) examining year-end revenue in the music industry shows and interesting mix of both promising and troubling figures. Perhaps the most important statistic to glean from the report is the absolute domination of streaming as a percentage of total recorded music revenue: seventy five percent.Streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora make up 75% of the $9.8 billion total revenue from recorded music in 2018. totalling $7.4 billion. It also accounts for “virtually all the revenue growth for the year.” Digital downloads declined for the sixth year in a row, with permanent downloads of albums dropping 25% and individual track sales falling 28%. Revenues from shipments of physical products also decreased, down 23% from 2017.Paid subscriptions to streaming services continues to grow, however, reaching 50 million combined between all services for the first time ever. The figure increased 42% over 2017, demonstrating a bright future for streaming.However, as subscriptions to streaming platforms increasingly becomes the dominant source of revenue, artists, labels, and industry professionals must always remain vigilant and cognizant of return rates from these services and how they affect a team’s bottom line.

There are a lot of unknowns and new variable to navigate within the new venue, especially for seasoned veterans used to Bayfront Park. But with each passing day, at the very least, we’re seeing the stages come together more and more.Thanks to @edmvibes24x7 on Instagram, we can see the progress of the main stage and megastructure, which will house the Live Arena on Friday and Saturday, and ASOT on Sunday.The first picture shows the Ultra main stage nearing completion, featuring the top half of the LED panels installed and tested.

"A festival in Australia headlined by The Presets, Hayden James, and Hot Dub Time Machine is being dubbed Fyre Festival 2.0 after a disappointed showing culminated in a “dangerous” weather event and festival cancellation.Wine Machine is a traveling festival with five dates across Australia in March and April. This past weekend, the festival came to NSW where it was met with a variety of challenges including weather and staff.While tickets to NSW Wine Machine were only $150 versus thousands of dollars at Fyre Festival, the conditions of the former are getting it compared to the latter. Around the time that The Presets began their set, a massive thunderstorm rolled in and the festival was moved to be cancelled and the attendees ushered out into the cold and rain.Chaos at Wine Machine!!! pic.twitter.com/PFfH8Cb99s— Gabrielle 🌻 (@Gxbriellemxry) March 23, 2019“When the storm hit, you guys were not concerned about the safety of your patrons,” wrote one attendee in a now-deleted post, according to .“It was ‘how quick can we kick them out into the lightning’. A tree came down in front of us and a guy broke his leg. So much for duty of care. You need to start thinking about your customers and not the $$$. Disgusting.”Issues with food and drink were felt long before the weather turned bad, as well. Reports of long queues came in from attendees; this was due to “severe understaffing” from “two minibuses carrying 32 members of bar staff breaking down,” writes .NSW licensing laws also limited attendees to two drinks per person, which only served to fan the flames of an already impatient and tired crowd.The internet has become quick to label any festival with even mild complications as Fyre 2.0, as trolls rule the comment sections; however, from the videos and details released of NSW Wine Machine, the comparison rings more true here than many other places.Wine Machine statement: [email protected][email protected] australiafyre fest 2.0Thunderstormunderstaffingwine machineLover of all bass music.

"Music is powerful, we all know that — but it may be more powerful than we’ve previously realized. As a new study reveals, our favorite music memories are enough to resist Alzheimer’s and dementia.Whenever we hear a song that we’re particularly into, our brain goes through a process called Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR), which basically feels like a tingling sensation. It’s almost orgasmic — a natural buzz us music lovers get when a song inspires something within us. If you’re on our website reading this, chances are you’ve felt this and know exactly what we’re talking about.So, ASMR actually catalogs that music in a special way. According to The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease, those confusing and heartbreaking affects of Alzheimer’s may for a short time subside when those affected hear their favorite music from the past. Researchers have seen this haze in Alzheimer’s patients subside, and now there’s some proper research backing the ASMR phenomenon.Contributor to the study, Jeff Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor in Radiology at the Univerity of Utah Health, says: “In our society, the diagnoses of dementia are snowballing and are taxing resources to the max. No one says playing music will be a cure for Alzheimer’s disease, but it might make the symptoms more manageable, decrease the cost of care and improve a patient’s quality of life.” H/T: EurekAlert!

"As I wrote yesterday, Zedd is pop. But I also said we might be getting a more EDM side to him on his new remix for his own “365” with Katy Perry — and I was right. In fact, more than I initially thought.This isn’t -Zedd, this isn’t even -Zedd, this is a side of Zedd we’ve never seen before as he goes deep house on “365.” With pitched down vocals and a wide, ambient atmosphere, Zedd takes “365” from the main stage to the club bassment. It’s super vibey and minimal, which are not adjectives I’d ever think to use describing Zedd’s music, but… here we are.Zedd’s remix below actually instills hope in me again that Zedd hasn’t completely abandoned his EDM roots.

"Beatport just recognized bass house as an official genre category and to be honest — it’s about time.Part of the beauty of Beatport is its user-friendly interface and breakdown by genre. The ability a music lover has to go down the rabbit hole of any given category and hear an in depth snapshot of the current trends is second to none. Truly an unbeatable experience.It can be dangerous at times, because with all the popping charts and relevant, hand-picked selections — it’s easy to spend a lot of money on music. However, Beatport hasn’t fully capitalized on the bass house genre until now. With Jauz, JOYRYDE, Malaa, Tchami and more dominating the category, it’s going to be hard to stop exploring bass house once you’ve started.In 2014, Jauz hit us with “Feel The Volume” and we all felt the bass house movement come alive. Even if you don’t absolutely love that style of music, it’s impossible to ignore it’s impact on EDM and dance music culture.Thankfully, the days of bass house productions being sprinkled into categories such as electro and future house, garage and more are over. At this point, the genre has been popularized enough to be its own thing. We’re stoked — and we’re not the only ones. MixmagRukes.com bass housebeatportDownloadsgenrejauzmusicWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Getter has been more in touch with his feelings than ever, and he’s making the best music of his career because of it. He wrapped up 2018 with his new album  and started off 2019 with the wonky trap tune “Ham Sandwich.” Now, he’s back to his emotion side on new single “Never Change” with HvrdLxck.“Never Change” is Getter’s first release of the year on mau5trap, which seems to have taken quite the liking to his new sound. Teaming up with HvrdLxck (who’s actually Getter’s TM), “Never Change” is an emotionally charged song with very open and telling lyrics.The combination of emo influence and electronic/hip hop production comes out beautifully and really feels like Getter has at last found comfort in where he is. Check out “Never Change” below. electronicemogetterHip Hophxrdlvcknever changevisceralLover of all bass music. I'm not afraid to speak my mind and put it to paper, and I do it often.

"South African artist Daniel Baron has filed a legal suit against David Guetta for copyright infringement, alleging that Guetta copied elements of his 2016 single, “Children of The Sun.”Guetta released “Light Headed” with Sia in 2017 as a single from his album  which came out the following year. Baron alleges that, when Guetta played Ultra South Africa in 2017, it’s likely that he heard “Children Of The Sun” on the radio, during the height of its popularity.Baron went onto the the South African radio show Breakfast with Martin Bester to speak about the situation and offer up some background to the lawsuit — it didn’t just come out of nowhere. The beginning of the interview includes a comparison between the two tracks — so judge for yourself.Content hosted by iono.fmBaron says in the interview:He explains that he preferred to handle the situation privately at first, sending Guetta a formal legal letter about the situation in December 2018. When he didn’t hear back, he and his team started sending it to anyone who might get it in Guetta’s hands, even on his social media.The letter asks Guetta to credit Baron and issue compensation for the use of his work. writes, “Guetta’s label Warner Music has not commented on the legal tiff. Guetta also hasn’t acknowledged the dispute at all on social media.” Rukes.com children of the sunCopyright Infringementdaniel barondavid guettalawsuitlight headedsiaLover of all bass music.

"Deadmau5 went on BBC Radio 1 last night for his first solo Essential Mix since 2008. Over 10 years later, a lot has changed, both for deadmau5 personally and in the dance music world. For starters, Deadmau5 has a new alias to bring along for the ride: testpilot.The entire first hour of the Essential Mix is dedicated to his testpilot side, focusing on more techno and house; he mixes in tracks from Nic Fanciulli, Pig & Dan, Cosmic Boys, and more with ease. He also played his unreleased testpilot tune “Fall” at the end of the hour. The second half is devoted to his classic deadmau5 music, mixing tracks like “Moar Ghosts N Stuff” with unreleased cuts like “A Seed,” “Saturn,” and “Coasted.”Essential Mix excels at sending listeners on a vibrant and unique two-hour journey, and you can hear it all below.testpilot played:

"The first night of BUKU Music + Arts Festival ended last night with headlining performances from Lana Del Rey, RL Grime, Claude Von Stroke, and others — but the show didn’t end when the festival let out. Over at Republic, From First To Last was throwing down a hard set as they reunited with former frontman Skrillex for the first time in two years.From First To Last reunited for their first show in over a decade at Emo Nite LA two years ago, so the atmosphere last night definitely carried some weight with it. Sonny Moore, aka Skrillex, got up close and personal with the crowd as he screamed and and inspired nostalgia in hundreds.The band played a DJ set earlier in the day at the main festival, but this late night show was more intimate and exclusive, and tickets quickly sold out after it was announced.

"After launching the record label Sable Valley on February 6 with “Arcus,” RL Grime & co. have finally introduced the first new artist to the label: Jackal. A label representative told Your EDM that this “feels like the perfect introduction to the kind of sound we will be pushing forward on SV.”The new song, “Christ Person, Woman God,” has a distinctly future bass-leaning sound with a heavy emphasis on melody, sound design, and especially interesting production characteristics. It shares elements of music released by the likes of G Jones, Rustie, Baauer, and Sam Gellaitry. Surely, with such a stellar complement of influences, you can’t go wrong.“Christ Person, Woman Good” is the first new song from Jackal in 2019 and surely represents another step up for the UK-born, LA-based artist.

"Kaskade is not booked to play Beyond Wonderland in Southern California this weekend. Kaskade also does not produce drum & bass. (Kaskade is, however, credited with one DnB release as DJ Radon from 1997.) And yet, Kaskade showed up to Beyond last night for a secret set at the secluded “Rabbit Hole” stage and threw down a set of drum & bass that had Twitter on fire.It’s not uncommon for artists who aren’t booked to officially play an Insomniac festival to randomly show up and play one of their hidden stages or art cars — Kaskade himself performed a Redux set on the KALLIOPE Art Car at EDC Las Vegas 2017, though that was announced prior. Still, it’s safe to say that anyone in attendance at this particular surprise set is going home with a once-in-a-lifetime memory that won’t soon be replicated.See some highlights from the set below as captured by Twitter users.

"The world might still be waiting for that DJ Snake & Zomboy collab, but we’re getting the next best thing tomorrow with “SouthSide,” from DJ Snake and Eptic.A version of the collab has been floating around on YouTube since at least May 2018, but Eptic first acknowledged the track and played it out at Lost Lands this past year, during his b2b with Must Die! on the main stage.Hit Lost Lands with that new new 😏 Track: DJ Snake x Eptic – ID[ @conorgrayfilms ] pic.twitter.com/okoV1mDFXi— EPTIC (@Eptic) September 17, 2018The recording is admittedly low quality, but you can easily tell it’s insane.

"Ultra Music Festival is officially ONE WEEK AWAY! With the full lineup out, set times revealed, hotels, shuttles, and ferries booked, we’re in the home stretch. One of the last things to do is construct the stages, and it looks like the main stage is well underway.This drone shot shared by Everything Ultra and captured by @djjp305miami shows a crew working on the main stage, securing trusses and arranging electricals. The iconic Ultra “U” is already affixed at the top of the stage, but the remaining panels and bulk of the stage still remain.Apart from the main stage, the drone shot also gives us a good look at all of the stages and the wonderful, lush nature of Virginia Key. It also puts into perspective just how massive Miami Marine Stadium really is. Various diagrams have already shown the difference between Bayfront Park and the Stadium area, but it’s truly an enormous difference.It’s also harder for random passerby to get a good look at the stage or watch lighting demos, as the venue is on an actual island this time — the Miami EarthCam is also of no use this time around.Check out the video below and get ready! Ultra is one week away.Woah!! I’m definitely getting a #drone for next year!

"Surely you didn’t think Flume would just drop his  mixtape and be done, right? Surely you didn’t think that he’d get announced for Lollapalooza and just head home, right?? We’re all terribly excited for Flume’s return and we don’t want it to end.Minutes ago, Flume posted the Lollapalooza lineup, conveying his excitement to be at the head of the bill. But it’s the rest of the caption that has us wide eyed and dreaming: “more shows and more music to come…”The decision to call  a mixtape, rather than an album (for which it clearly meets the requirements) sparked a lot of debate between industry professionals. The general consensus behind the reasoning was that there could even be another actual  due out in 2019 — the jury is still out on that, but at least now we know that there is more music coming.Tickets to Lollapalooza are on sale now.

"Zedd & Katy Perry released their collaboration “365” last month on Valentine’s Day, and we feel comfortable coming out and saying it — Zedd is pop. That’s not an insult, just a statement of fact. However, he’s been pop for a while, and even still, he managed to light up Ultra’s main stage with a truly awesome set in 2017, so it’s not like he’s abandoned his roots.I bring up that set because he’s just announced a remix pack for “365” coming tomorrow, with remixes from Jonas Aden, KUURO, Ellis, and… Zedd.Remixes from Zedd are few and far between these days, with his most recent being for Shawn Mendes’ “Lost In Japan” in 2018. His last remix before that was for “Let Me Love You” from DJ Snake — still one of our favorites, by the way.There’s a good chance that we’ll see a more EDM side to Zedd with this remix, or at least, I’m hopeful for it.

The video could also be considered a teaser for a final  set.Odesza has 14 more tour dates scheduled from now through Electric Forest.

"Egg Boy has gone viral and many musicians across Australia and New Zealand have his back…Acts including Hilltop Hoods, Joel Birch, The Living End and more have offered the young, brave man free entry to their shows for life. He even scored free tickets to Rolling Loud Music Festival this year, and every year.17-year-old Will Connolly from Hampton, Melbourne gained instant fame over the weekend for smashing an egg on the head of far-right Australian political figure, Senator Fraser Anning. The egging happened as the senator addressed reporters in Melbourne, Australia on Friday following the Christchurch shooting.Connolly was arrested and released pending further investigation, according to police.Here’s the footage…Holy shit, he full smacks him with a lefty and egg boy just cops it and keeps filming.

Hell, he can be our official photographer too… Love you egg boy! pic.twitter.com/szNIHpQVCv— Violent Soho (@violentsoho) March 16, 2019Egg Boy didn’t act without warrant. This happened after Senator Anning was widely condemned for blaming the devastating Christchurch massacre in New Zealand on Muslim immigration.“I am utterly opposed to any form of violence within our community, and I totally condemn the actions of the gunman,” Anning said. “However, whilst this kind of violent vigilantism can never be justified, what it highlights is the growing fear within our community, both in Australia and New Zealand of the increasing Muslim presence.”See more of his statement here…Just incredible: As 49 Muslim worshippers lay dead in New Zealand, a sitting Australian senator blames “the immigration program which allowed Muslim fanatics to migrate to New Zealand”. pic.twitter.com/13w7aAK8IR— Jim Sciutto (@jimsciutto) March 15, 2019At the core of this delightful bit of internet gold is a very serious political issue. Music events like Rolling Loud and the artists below are showing their support for Egg Boy (and shame against Senator Anning), with free guestlist and +1s. The larger scope — this is a stand against bigotry.A GoFundMe campaign has also been initiated in honor of Egg Boy, and more importantly the victims of the Christchurch terrorist attack.

"ILLENIUM is the man who cannot be stopped. After selling out two nights at Red Rocks (and adding a third), announcing a show at Madison Square Garden, and following up his first single of 2019, “Crashing,” he releases “Pray” today with Kameron Alexander.Before you even listen to the track, you’ll notice that the art follows the story begun by “God Damnit” in 2018. The cloaked figure has followed the phoenix into the cave and now seems to confront him — is he asking a question or pledging his allegiance? We’ll likely find out on the next track, but these all seem to point to ILLENIUM’s next album, due out sometime this year.Now that’s out of the way, let’s get to the track. At once, it’s immediately at odds with “Crashing,” which remains ILLENIUM’s most pop track yet. “Pray” certainly starts off with a bit of a singer/songwriter vibe, beginning with acoustic guitar riffs and Alexander’s emotive voice. But following that beautiful intro, ILLENIUM takes us back with his iconic melodic bass and suddenly I’m envisioning myself surrounded by beautiful lights and people.“Pray” takes it one step further with the next drop, utilizing a more glitchy and midtempo style sound to play and interact with the melody.Overall, this is one of our favorite ILLENIUM tracks in some time, and we’re so excited we finally get to hear it.

"Yesterday, Odesza worried and delighted fans with a teaser of their final A Moment Apart show. The duo has been touring the album since September 2017, and it just seems right to send it off with an epic finale.Today, the date and location of the finale show has been announced: July 27 in Los Angeles at Los Angeles State Historic Park. The venue has seen only a couple EDM events since its renovation finished, including Zedd’s Zedd in the Park and HARD Day of the Dead last year.The size of the venue and it’s simultaneously, deceivingly intimate nature seem like a fantastic send off to one of the greatest album tours in EDM. While fans are likely disappointed that it’s not at a more grand venue like Red Rocks or The Gorge, Odesza are sure to make anyone’s trip from out-of-state worthwhile.Get more information and see the event page here.

"Like a ton of bricks, JOYRYDE just hit us with another track off his forthcoming debut album . In collaboration with GOLD, the producer proves yet again that he’s the master of bass-driven, genre-bending certified slappers.GOLD drops some some heavy words on the beat as JOYRYDE lays down a thick blend of hip hop, bass and trap. This is a producer that’s persistent in finding unique hybrid with every release, but the end result always screams JOYRYDE. Blindfold any listener with a trained ear and they’d be able to pinpoint his distinct style heard with “YUCK.”The moody track leaves fans at the edge of their seats, with an abrupt ending that probably lands perfectly with the next track. Once  drops we’ll be able to fill in the gaps.

"While the Ultra app is still your best bet for keeping track of set times at the festival next week, Ultra also just tweeted out a handy chart of times and locations so you can always know where to go. For those of us who haven’t downloaded the app or aren’t even going, one “artist” caught our attention… Colonel Sanders.Somehow, Colonel Sanders is going to be on Ultra’s main stage for five minutes, from 3:55-4pm local time, on Friday, March 29. We looked on the lineup posted — Colonel Sanders is not mentioned. An Ultra attendee posted these screenshots (below) in the Ultra Facebook group and that’s a picture of Colonel Sanders. From KFC. Colonel Sanders from KFC.What. Is. Going. On.Clearly, Ultra has some sort of surprise in store, or perhaps this is just a silly easter egg in the app. It’s impossible to tell right now what attendees will see on the main stage if they wait until 3:55pm EST on Friday, but I’d absolutely be willing to let curiosity get the better of me. colonel sandersfestivalfinger lickin' goodlineupmiamiset timesSpecial GuestultraLover of all bass music.

"Lollapalooza dropped its 2019 lineup this morning and what a doozy it is. While it shares all of Coachella’s headliners, the four-day festival is able to expand its variety with an extra day and also digs deeper for some serious talent.In addition to Ariana Grande, Childish Gambino, and Tame Impala, Lollapalooza is also bringing twenty one pilots, The Strokes, Flume, The Chainsmokers, and J Balvin for a seriously diverse and impressive headliner lineup.But the fun doesn’t stop at the first two lines. Examining further down reveals Madeon, RUFUS DU SOL, Gud Vibrations vs Slugz Music, Alesso, RL Grime, San Holo, and even a new live show from Ducky. And that’s just the dance music.Lollapalooza also has Bring Me The Horizon, signaling the return of lead singer Oliver Sykes after he ruptured a vocal chord on tour in February. This, in addition to Death Cab For Cutie, Maggie Rogers, Fitz And The Tantrums, Hozier, Tenacious D, and more.Tickets are on sale now — check out the official Spotify playlist for the festival here. 2019chainsmokersFlumelineuplollapaloozamadeonLover of all bass music.

"If you like Flume, if you like weird bass music, if you like mature electronic music, then I’m not really sure it can get much better than this. Flume’s new mixtape, “Hi This Is Flume,” has arrived in full and it’s nothing short of perfect.Every time that Flume releases new music, I question just how long he can continue doing what he does. His ability to capture the essence of what makes Flume, “Flume” in an even better way on each consecutive project is possibly the most spectacular evolution to witness in electronic music. From front to back, he is unapologetically himself throughout this entire mixtape. Odd canters and off-beat patterns revolve throughout the atmosphere and justly applied vocals fill the void in between, providing just enough backing for the pulsating rhythms strewn almost carelessly between tracks. I say carelessly, but it’s truly a careless perfection. Like the artist he is, it feels like Flume threw paint at the wall and it just happened to turned out flawless.At 17 tracks, with just a taste of the right collabs from Eprom (x2, on a remix and an original), SOPHIE, Kučka, JPEG Mafia, HWLS, and Slowthai, it’s hard to conceive that we may still also get a fully-fledged and more mainstream lilting album from the Aussie this year.All I have left to say is, enjoy.1.

"When you hear Billie Eilish’s music, EDM is probably not the first genre that comes to mind. This hasn’t stopped the singer’s music from being featured on playlists by Deadmau5 and remixed by the likes of Zeds Dead, Marian Hill, and TroyBoi. Produced entirely by Eilish’s older brother, Finneas O’Connell, in the pair’s childhood bedroom, Eilish’s songs use a lot of electronic elements that EDM fans will resonate with. And the use of unique audio samples (like the dentist drill sample used throughout the song “To Bury a Friend” lifted from a video Eilish took during a dentist appointment) paired with surrealistic music videos lends an almost Rezz-like vibe to the music. Now, weeks ahead of the singer’s debut album, Elish has released a second music video for her single “You Should See Me In A Crown.” The single originally premiered on BBC Radio 1 by Annie Mac on the acclaimed DJ’s eponymous radio show back in July of 2018.While the original music video for the song is very simple, it is also very fucking scary. Throughout the video, the camera cuts in and out of different frames of Eilish as she bends down and picks up a crown and sets it on her head while staring straight into the camera. Oh, and I forgot to mention, the whole time she does this she is covered with a shit ton of spiders. At one point, a tarantula crawls out of the singer’s mouth to crawl on her face. Given that Eilish has verified that every single spider in the video is real, I don’t recommend viewing it if you are even slightly squeamish around spiders, which makes a second music video for the song almost a necessity for fans of the singer.A preview for the new video is located above. The full video is exclusive to Apple Music subscribers.

"Just hours after Flume revealed he was dropping a new mixtape tomorrow, Lollapalooza dropped their 2019 festival trailer with brand new Flume music. The comments are almost entirely comprised of Flume fans vs Lolla ticket buyers, showing just how strong his pull is.The song is pretty much classic Flume, with crisp sound design and high pitched fx, fuzzy white noise, and snappy drums.

"The lineup for Woodstock 50 just dropped out of nowhere and there’s a lot to examine with the full scope of artists, but here’s the rub. The festival will go down August 16-18 in Watkins Glen, NY. It will be headlined by:From a cursory glance, hip hop, rock, pop, and country are all fairly represented on the lineup with plenty of artists each representing their style. The only thing missing in entirety from the lineup? Dance music. Woodstock 99 still managed to have some electronic acts, like Fatboy Slim, Moby, and The Chemical Brothers, so it’s curious that there are zero artists on this lineup with an ostensibly bigger budget.Still, the lineup boasts a number of interesting and can’t miss acts, such as the reunion of Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeroes, who famously broke up in 2014 after firing lead singer Jade Castrinos. Jack White is also getting The Raconteurs back together, with Woodstock 50 being only their second announced US performance.Championing the younger artists, Greta van Fleet, Maggie Rogers, Grandson, Halsey, and more are all prominently featured.Tickets for Woodstock 50 will go on sale April 22nd.

Over time, we’ve glorified and edified these artists, likely in the same fashion that many of the artists on the ’19 lineup will be.It’s still too early to tell how well the festival will sell, or what other artists might still be added to the lineup.

"Lollapalooza dropped a fantastic lineup yesterday with a slew of great headliners and an incredible undercard. Included in the lineup is Madeon, who was quick to specify that his set would be a Live one for the festival (as opposed to a DJ set at Porter Robinson’s Second Sky).A fan on Twitter asked, perhaps blithely, if it was going to be a DJ set or a “new album live show,” and Madeon clarified that it would be a whole new show. Whether this points to new music or not — we think it does — is up for debate, but the fact remains that we’ll be seeing a side of Madeon never seen before come August.New show— Madeon (@madeon) March 20, 2019Apart from “Shelter” with Porter in 2016, Madeon has not released any new music since his debut album  in 2015.

"Last week, Spotify announced that it had filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with the European Union. On Friday, Apple responded, addressing many but not all of Spotify’s claims about its service and how it charges vendors in its App Store.Today, Spotify has responded to Apple’s response, calling the company “monopolist” and alleging that their response on Friday was “entirely in line with our expectations.”In a response to Apple’s response, late Friday morning a Spotify rep said: “Every monopolist will suggest they have done nothing wrong and will argue that they have the best interests of competitors and consumers at heart. In that way, Apple’s response to our complaint before the European Commission is not new and is entirely in line with our expectations.“We filed our complaint because Apple’s actions hurt competition and consumers, and are in clear violation of the law. This is evident in Apple’s belief that Spotify’s users on iOS are Apple customers and not Spotify customers, which goes to the very heart of the issue with Apple.

"Debut albums are important milestone in any artist’s career – but back in 2003 in the electronic music world, they were far less common than they are today. And for an artist to persist and grow to become a legend in the past 16 years is absolutely noteworthy. Today, Kaskade’s debut album  celebrates its 16th anniversary.It’s You, It’s Me😱 16 years old today 😱 https://t.co/bMvE1I0WSRWhen’s the last time you listened to this?— Kaskade (@kaskade) March 18, 2019Coincidentally the same day that Skrillex’s debut album  was released, Kaskade’s album was released in a much different musical era. Back in 2003, “dubstep” was but a glimmer in popular culture’s eyes; “future bass” wasn’t even a thing — “regular” bass hardly even was; Justin Bieber was only 9 years old.Listening back on the album now, there are far fewer “main stage” moments in the production. It’s about groove, rhythm, melody, and soul, rather than glitz, flash, massive bass, and major label features. There’s a time and a place for both, but it’s hard to argue that without the first, there wouldn’t be the second.Check out  from Kaskade below. Rukes.com 16 yearsAnniversarydebut albumit's you it's mekaskadeLover of all bass music.

"Over the past year, many artists from multiple genres of music have started to bring attention to mental health issues in the music industry. The tragic passings of Avicii and Mac Miller last year, helped shine a light on just how much of a toll the stresses and rigors of celebrity and touring can take on one’s mental health. One of the more prominent artists to recently take a break for mental health purposes was producer/DJ Carnage. Back in November, the man who many know as Papi Gordo, decided he needed to focus on himself, Diamante Blackmon.The head of the ASOC crew made his triumphant return to the stage at Exchange LA last weekend and his fans came out in full force to support. Carnage returned in the most Papi Gordo way possible, teaming up with legendary Los Angeles eatery, Roscoe’s Chicken & Waffles, to offer a free plate to every ticket holder. It was a total house party vibe as fans were chowing on down on the delicious chicken and waffles while listening to tunes at the bottom level of the club. One fan remarked that the food was worth the price of entry, and another fan brought in (and offered me) some hot sauce. Needless to say, the crowd was in high spirits.Original Photo by BRXVNAfter an opening set by SLUDGE, Carnage dropped a heavy set, with a lot of hardstyle, hardcore, dubstep, and even some drum & bass. It was clear, Papi Gordo was feeling himself as he rained fire on the crowd. However, he went in a totally different direction for the final half hour of his set as he turned the rave into a late 90’s/early 2000’s rap and hip-hop party. It was here that Carnage started addressing the crowd more, and it’s clear he was feeling stupendous. He also took the opportunity to bring out some guests during this part of his set, and while he has critics as a dance music producer, lest we forget that Carnage is also an outstanding hip-hop producer. He’s worked with heavy hitters in that genre from Migos, Lil’ Pump, Young Thug, and of course his late friend, Mac Miller.Carnage brought out some friends including young rapper O’Jeezy, but the absolute moment of the night is when none other than G-Eazy came down the stairs and treated the Exchange crowd to a live rendition of his smash hit “No Limit.” When @carnage brings out @g_eazy and the crowd loses their minds. Was not expecting that. Also, shouts to @roscoesofficial for feeding everyone. I wish I could have chicken & waffles before every show! #edm #hiphop #la #itwaslit #teampixelA post shared by  Mark (@farkmabrick) on Carnage has definitely faced criticism in the past, but this man certainly inspired a lot of good vibes this Friday night in Los Angeles. As part of his comeback, he’s just released his most unexpected song yet, “Letting People Go” featuring Prinze George, and moody and hypnotic indie-dance track. For every save the track receives on Spotify / Apple Music, Carnage will donate $1 to the RAICES Foundation, a nonprofit agency that provides free and low-cost legal services to underserved immigrant children, families, and refugees based in Texas. Carnage himself, was brought to the US from Guatemala by his parents at a very young age, so this is definitely a personal cause, and it’s always great to see an artist use their platform to promote some good.Listen to “Letting People Go” below and expect a ton of new music from Carnage in the coming months. asocCarnagediamante blackmonexchange lag eazyletting people golos angelesmac millerpapi gordoroscoe's chicken & wafflessludgeI am a Los Angeles native and lover of all things electro.

"Illenium left a lot of fans scratching their heads with his most recent single, “Crashing” featuring Bahari. While he’s slowly been moving in this directly, this single was the first that was more pop than electronic. We’d never criticize Illenium for simply branching out — after all, the song still sounds amazing — but I’d be lying if a lot of us weren’t hoping for something a little heavier.Thankfully, a slew of remixes for “Crashing” just dropped, including the gritty KLOUD remix below, premiered by Proximity. From the very beginning, it easy to tell this remix is going in a darker direction. That textured bass synth lurking beneath the surface and the slightly pitched down vocals both hint at as much.The drop of KLOUD’s remix is a seething electro house banger, focusing mostly on the melody and carrying it forward with a heavy and pulsing rhythm. It’s entirely at odds with the original, nor is it something that Illenium might himself make; but fans are sure to dig this one’s more weighty sound.The remix pack also includes cuts from DROELOE and Rock Mafia, along with a stripped down version of the original — listen to them all below. crashingdarkerDROELOEelectro houseILLENIUMkloudpopremixLover of all bass music.

"Yesterday, I wrote an article titled “Ghastly Will Retire His Current Alias After Next EP To Focus On House Music” based on a tweet that Ghastly posted. The tweet read:At first glance, I interpreted this to mean that he was retiring his Ghastly alias and starting a new one. Unfortunately, that interpretation was wrong. Rather than reach out to Ghastly or his team, I made a knee-jerk judgement and sent the post out on social media.Today, Ghastly responded, “Big ol misinterpretation here – I’m not retiring Ghastly I’m starting another project.”After reaching out directly to Ghastly today, he clarified that the Ghastly alias is going back to his house roots, and he’s creating a new alias for the aforementioned “pretty music.”While I deeply regret not reaching out to Ghastly directly for greater clarification, and sit here today with egg on my face, I still stand by my final sentence in yesterday’s article: “Whatever Ghastly does next, we’re here for it and wish him all the best.” Rukes.com correctionghastlyhouse musicnew aliaspretty musicLover of all bass music.

"Earlier this week, Spotify announced that it had filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with the European Union, “alleging that the iPhone maker is harming consumer choice and stifling innovation via the rules it enforces on the App Store,” summarizes .As outlined in a blog post from Spotify’s CEO Daniel Ek, the company seemed to take particular issue with a 30 percent “tax” that the App Store levies against app creators. Spotify launched the following video as part of a press campaign to bring awareness to the injustices it claims Apple is perpetrating.In response to these claims and the lawsuit, Apple released an official statement this morning refuting and taking issue with much of what Spotify claims. It begins:Apple’s response takes a very surprised and hurt tone for the majority of the text. The general idea is that Apple doesn’t know where all these allegations from Spotify are originating. In response to many of the technological claims, Apple says they’ve worked with Spotify every step of the way, offering their services and reaching out with development help whenever possible.“We found Spotify’s claims about Apple Watch especially surprising,” it reads at one point. “When Spotify submitted their Apple Watch app in September 2018, we reviewed and approved it with the same process and speed with which we would any other app. In fact, the Spotify Watch app is currently the No. 1 app in the Watch Music category.”With regards to the 30 percent “tax” that Spotify so heavily leans on in their press, Apple says that 84 percent of the apps in the App Store “pay nothing to Apple when you download or use the app.”“The only contribution that Apple requires is for digital goods and services that are purchased inside the app using our secure in-app purchase system,” it continues. “As Spotify points out, that revenue share is 30 percent for the first year of an annual subscription — but they left out that it drops to 15 percent in the years after.”Apple accuses Spotify of using rhetoric to appear magnanimous in the public eye while going behind content creators’ backs in their own self interest. Examples include Spotify’s recent appeal to the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) decision last year to increase payout rates to songwriters by 44% over the next five years, an action which has been popularly (and “dubiously,” as puts it) referred to as “suing music creators.”Read Apple’s full statement here. antitrustapp storeApplefires backlawsuitofficial statementresponseSpotifyLover of all bass music.

"GRiZ has a certain kind of way of letting us know that everything’s going to be okay. His latest feel-good single from forthcoming album  taps into funk-filled dreams and calls on rapper Wiz Khalifa to tell it like it is.“Find My Own Way” rocks just the right recipe for chilling out, but the message will lift you off your feet. The song sets up an atmosphere fit for the GRiZ Live Band, with layers of instruments and vocals, leaving enough space for his signature sax. Five tracks in and Ride Waves is shaping up to be one of GRiZ’s greatest impressions yet.Wiz Khalifa speaks on the release in his own words: “The first time I heard the beat for ‘Find My Own Way,’ I knew there was something special there since the beat alone feels good. I just had to sit with it and smoke a little KK and figure out my approach and I think it came out exactly how it should.”GRiZ and Wiz aren’t in this alone, the Harlem Gospel Choir busts out even more inspiration and flavor, making for a grand slam production.This song will get you through today — and every day you put it on.

"Just weeks ahead of the 2019 installment of Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival, a lawsuit against the iconic event has been dismissed.According to a report, Oregon-based promotion company Soul’d Out Productions claimed Coachella’s restrictive radius clause was in violation of anti-trust law. Specifically, the part that has forbidden artists from playing any other North American festivals between December 15 through May 1.Soul’d Out said artists including SZA and Daniel Caesar were forced to turn down opportunities with their company because of Coachella’s radius clause. Now, the judge in the case has totally dismissed those allegations along with the entire lawsuit. It was ultimately determined no anti-trust violation was made by Goldenvoice.Coachella organizers said back in 2018 they would “vigorously defend against this lawsuit, which calls into question a long-standing industry practice that is crucial to our ability to continue offering fans the unrivaled experience for which Coachella has become known.” Pitchfork coachellaGoldenvoicelawsuitradius clauseSoul'd Out ProductionsWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

We’ve faced personal hardships since our Future Soup EP was released, but it’s time we put together a project for you. These misfortunes helped us grow as a group and reignited our love and passion for music. The songs we created in this dusk have brought so much joy and love into our lives. This creative catalyst has propelled us to construct our Love And Retrograde EP. The EP touches on our hardships and how we navigated through it. Our fans mean the world to us and we can’t wait to share our vision with you. The first single “Hold Me Back” ft. @johnsplithoff will be out this Friday with the rest of the EP being released over the next few months. Pre save link for ""Hold Me Back"" in our bio. Until then we hope to see your smiling faces out on the dancefloor.

"Want to go for a ride? That’s just what’ll happen when you check out Icarus’s awesome new video for “Sirens.” Fresh off a US/UK tour with RÜFÜS DU SOL, the Bristol duo are back with a smooth new track as well as a trippy and entrancing video to accompany it. The song opens with some light chords to set the tone and a soft, moody vocal. After the track builds up we’re left with a super dance-able drop and chorus. Not only would this track sound great in the club, it’ll sound great on the car ride home at 3 AM too.Speaking of driving, the video takes us a on psychedelic car ride through the city in the wee morning hours. Told from the perspective of the “getaway driver,” the viewer gets transported to a trippy world full of bright lights, kaleidoscopic views of the city, and tight turns through colorfully lit tunnels and roads that really make you feel like you’re riding shotgun on this audio-visual journey. As the drop and chorus come in and the tempo of the song increases, the visuals only get more vibrant.Check out the video for “Sirens” by Icarus, off their  EP, out now.

"Both Facebook and Instagram have been largely unusable for most of today, March 13. The degree to which users experience issues on either site varies, but it’s not clear whether there’s any common factor, be it ISP, region, or what have you.Facebook issued a statement earlier today, ruling out a DDoS attack. Just now, Instagram finally tweeted via their official Twitter account, “We’re aware of an issue impacting people’s access to Instagram right now.

"Compared to last year, EDC Las Vegas is a month late, as of today, in releasing the lineup for 2019. We’re not super anxious, however, since we know it will be amazing no matter what. But we are getting a little impatient. Perhaps to appease fans, or maybe for no reason in particular, Insomniac founder and CEO Pasquale Rotella shared images of a new area at EDC on Instagram.Dubbed “Pixel Forest,” the area appears to lead into a walled-off section of the venue, adorned by pixelated blocks and likely plenty of pretty lights. Lit up IBC tanks will also be used to fill in some of the larger “pixel” areas.There’s no telling yet what exactly the Pixel Forest will be used for — whether it’s a chill spot for attendees or another area for music, or maybe it’s even going to be in the Camping area.More information on EDC Las Vegas is expected imminently. We’ll share news the moment we have it.View post on imgur.com  edc las vegasinsomniacnew areapasquale rotellapixel forestteaserLover of all bass music.

"After dropping the title track “Space Between” as the first single for the new EP back in February, the Grammy-nominated and multi-platinum producer, Matt Lange, wasted no time in delivering the rest of his highly anticipated EP via deadmau5’s mau5trap.Lange might not be a name every music festival fan has seen at the top of the lineup for their favorite raves, but chances are they have all heard his work. Keeping away from the crowds and constantly at work behind the scenes; Lange has made a name for himself in the music industry with his work as a musician, producer, DJ, and sound engineer. Dance music fans might also have heard one of his tunes in films such as Ready Player One, Blade Runner 2049, Deadpool 2, The Fast & Furious 8, or Transformers: The Last Knight.Having experience in the more commercial end of the musical spectrum seems to have helped the producer as he walks the line of making music for himself that can also appeal to an audience. According to the press release for the new EP, “Lange’s mysterious enigma has always lived in glitchy post modular sounds but  sees Matt explore a more accessible sound through 7 infectious tracks while keeping the integrity of his music. ”And in describing his newest release Matt Lange says, “The  EP explores the sonic aesthetic I’ve been honing in on over the past year, combining outboard and modular synths with acoustic instrumentation and collaborations with 2 of my favorite singers. Equally atmospheric and heavy, Space Between sets the context for my live sets moving forward.”Northern California residents will have a chance to catch Lange and perhaps get a glimpse at the new direction planned for his live sets at Monarch in San Francisco on March 23rd.

"Zeds Dead made a name for themselves in 2010-2013 by being an unstoppable force of innovative bass, through both remixes and originals. Aside from their collaborative work with Omar Linx, the two Canadian bass producers created a number of remixes that were wholly unique to their sound: “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood” by Nina Simone, “Gimme Shelter” by The Rolling Stones, “Paradise Circus” by Massive Attack, “Volcano” by Dragonette, and of course, “Eyes On Fire” by Blue Foundation.Over the years, their sound has changed slightly. They’ve explored more avenues in bass music while still keeping their same identity, but it’s impossible to say that it hasn’t evolved. But with their new remix of “Bury A Friend” by Billie Eilish, I feel that same excitement I did nearly a decade ago when I first discovered my love of Zeds Dead.And that’s not really a surprise, either. Dave Grohl compared Billie’s influence on her fans now to that of Nirvana’s in 1991 — that Zeds Dead would add her to their catalogue of remixes along with Massive Attack, Rolling Stones, and Nina Simone makes perfect sense.The remix is dark and sultry, but not ever overpowering. The bass notes keep you in the moment, remembering at all times, “This is Zeds Dead.” But best of all, Billie’s vocals are left nearly entirely intact. It’s a testament to her own skill as a vocalist, but also Zeds Dead’s instinct as producers.Like anything else involving Billie Eilish, this remix will probably go down as a classic in Zeds Dead’s discography when all is said and done. Check it out below. bass musicBillie Eilishbury a friendclassicdubstepremixzeds deadLover of all bass music. I'm not afraid to speak my mind and put it to paper, and I do it often.

"CORRECTION 3/15 | Ghastly is not retiring his current project. Your EDM unfortunately misinterpreted his tweet yesterday — he’s starting another project. We greatly regret the error.They say that everything must come to an end eventually, and it seems that applies to artists, as well. Or, at least, their aliases… David Crow, better known to the world as Ghastly, appears to say in a new tweet that he will be retiring his alias in 2019.That doesn’t mean that Crow will stop making music entirely — quite the opposite. He says that he’ll be focusing “entirely on house music,” but only after he drops a halftime bass EP soon.“I’m still going to be making pretty music,” he concludes, “but it won’t be under ghastly.”Ghastly made his break out in 2014 with his Mija collaboration, “Crank It.”Whatever Ghastly does next, we’re here for it and wish him all the best.U guys I’m gonna drop this halftime bass ep but after that I will be focusing entirely on house musicI’m still going to be making pretty music, but it won’t be under ghastlyStay tuned 🙂— Ghastly (◕,,,◕) (@Ghastly) March 14, 2019 Rukes.com announcementghastlyhouse musicretiring aliasLover of all bass music.

" Twitter‘s in-app camera is just a swipe away.The social media platform has introduced a new way to communicate over the platform with its latest feature. Now, it’s just as easy to pull up Twitter and take a video as it has been on Snapchat, Instagram, and other apps for some time.This move is widely seen as an effort to directly compete with Facebook and Instagram’s in-app camera feature — and yeah, it pretty much is. However, with Twitter being one of the biggest sources for instantaneous information, this seems like a no-brainer. It’s about time.The only thing that’s noticeably missing is an “edit” button, which other apps have capitalized on. Again, this is meant to be quick and instinctive. Perhaps an “edit” button will come with time, but this will get the job done.Users can expect roll out over the next few days.Here’s how to capture what’s happening via Twitter…See it? Tweet it!

"Tickets for Porter Robinson’s Second Sky Fest went on sale this morning and, as expected, the demand was high. The festival sold out quickly, but all hope is not lost. According to those trying to get tickets, they’re met with the following message:It seems silly that Porter and his team didn’t think demand for this festival would be as high as it is. But, at the same time, we’re not mad about adding another day either. Another Goldenvoice festival in California, Just Like Heaven Fest, also sold out quickly and ended up adding a second day with the same lineup — so the same move for Second Sky isn’t unprecedented.Pre-sale tickets for both days are now completely sold out, with a limited number of tickets for Sunday only being made available during general on sale, Friday, 3/15 at 10AM PST.

"It was a wild Saturday night in Los Angeles this past weekend as Valentino Khan took over the Hollywood Palladium for a massive headline show. Along with ETC!ETC! and Diablo as opening support, a slew of special guests joined Khan during his set to make the night unforgettable.Those in attendance were able to bear witness to a crazy appearance from both Shaq and Snoop Dogg on the same stage. From the sounds of the crowd, it seems like Dogg’s music is maybe a little old for this young crowd, but they absolutely know the D-oh-double-G when they see him.Diplo also came out to go b2b with Khan during one point in the show.

"Ever After Festival in Kitchener, Canada recently released a heavy lineup featuring bass legends such as Rusko, Excision, Feed Me, Kill the Snails, SKisM, Gentlemens Club and many more for their upcoming event that is currently scheduled Friday, June 7 to Sunday, June 9.In order to give fans of the festival the experience they deserve, organizers are asking the city for permission to begin the festival on Thursday the 6th from 6 to 11 p.m., running through 11 p.m. on Sunday the 9th capping the event off with a newly added silent disco that will end in the early morning at 1 AM. The request of the extension was recently reported in the Canadian news by Waterloo Region Record.The past couple years has seen a tense relationship between festival organizers and city officials in Kitchener, Ontario. In 2017 officials were flooded with 130 noise complaints about the festival. When the festival returned in 2018, organizers were given multiple restrictions from the city, including lowering the maximum noise levels in residential areas from 65 decibels to 55.The city’s director of bylaw enforcement, Gloria MacNeil, said she doesn’t anticipate that by adding music to a weekday there will be any additional encumbrance upon the residents of the neighborhood surrounding the event. MacNeil also noted that Thursday show will not only be on a smaller stage but will feature smaller acts, which according to her, “tend to use smaller sound systems and less bass.”While bylaw officials seem to be warming up to the festival’s presence by recommending that the Ever After Music Festival be allowed to add a fourth day, they are adamant that the maximum noise level remains capped at 55 decibels and that the event wraps up at 9 p.m. on Sunday. City councilors will consider the noise restrictions and decide at what time the festival should end at a committee meeting on March 18. bass musicever after festivalexcisionfeed meGentlemen's ClubILLENIUMkill the snailsnoise complaintsruskoskismWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"The fate of Spring Awakening Music Festival has been hanging in the balance for months now as fans grew inpatient. A few months ago SAMF met an all too familiar fate of their venue being pulled out from under them after the alderman of the 12th ward here in Chicago got wind that the festival had plans to move to Douglas Park, the home of Riot Fest.Thankfully, the wait is finally over! Spring Awakening has officially announced their new venue Poplar Creek at 59-90 Entertainment District in Hoffman Estates, a northwestern suburb of Chicago. The new 2019 location boasts 27 acres of land, nearly double that of last year’s site, which allows for bigger and better stages, more production, and additional experiential activitions. Complimentary shuttles from nearby Metra stations to the festival grounds will be provided to fest-goers. Additionally, the grounds are less than ten minutes from multiple hotel options, and for the first time in SAMF history, the location will allow for festival parking on site.While this new venue confirms many people’s suspicions of the festival moving into the suburbs of Chicago, those same people have to understand the difficulties that come along with securing venues and coordinating an event as large as SAMF. This new move will force React Presents to get creative, and, hopefully, is a chance to breathe new life into the event! Plus, along with this much anticipated news we are also lucky enough to get a taste of some of the artists in the same announcement.The headliners this year boast awesome talent from the likes of DJ Snake, GRiZ, Illenium, Martin Garrix, Rezz, and Zedd taking over the Solstice and Equinox stages. The full lineup, that will showcase more than 90 artists, will come later this week on Friday, March 15th!Tickets for Spring Awakening are on sale now on their website, snag them while you can! chicagolineupsamfspring awakeningspring awakening music fesitvalI work as the press coordinator, doing a lot of behind the scenes work here at Your EDM, as well as a ton of giveaways for our fans!

"The first edition of Tomorrowland Winter unofficially began this past Saturday, as attendees arrived as the French ski resort Alpe d’Huez. Unfortunately, today, around 250 attendees had to be temporarily evacuated from a ski track and bar at the resort after winds picked up and made conditions unsafe. Those evacuated also included artists.“It snowed a lot this morning, but it was not a problem. When the wind intensified, we had to close the lifts. Some at the top of the track did not have skis with them because they only wanted to party in the bar. So we used six groomers to get them down, “said spokesman Debby Wilmsen.Tomorrowland Winter is not cancelled, and doesn’t “officially” begin until Tuesday, or Wednesday when the main stage actually opens. Many of the attendees arrived early, however, to enjoy the resort’s amenities. The festival is expected to welcome nearly 25,000 attendees at its peak.Winds are expected to die down by tomorrow.

"Three weeks before Ultra Music Festival opens its gates in Miami, Brickell residents in the city have filed an “emergency complaint” against Miami, alleging that it violated its own charter in allowing Ultra to occupy Virginia Key.The complaint boils down to the agreement between the City of Miami and Ultra Music Festival allegedly being misrepresented as a license, rather than a lease. Doing so would sidestep the competitive bidding process required by the city charter.This isn’t even the first time that the license-versus-lease argument was used against Ultra. According to the Miami Herald, writes , “the license-versus-lease tactic was first raised last year by downtown residents trying to remove Ultra from Bayfront Park. City commissioners rejected an agreement to keep the festival at Bayfront before the idea evolved into a legal complaint.”A representative of the City of Miami said , “We are reviewing the complaint and will defend the city’s interest.” Miami New Times city of miamicomplaintfestivalmiamiultra music festivalLover of all bass music.

"From the first time that Virginia Key was named the replacement venue for Ultra Music Festival, after being removed from Bayfront Park, transportation has been one of its main issues. Ultra revealed shuttle and ferry options earlier this year, but ride share options remained scant.Following a meeting this week at the city’s downtown administrative headquarters, the has published a report stating that Ultra might do away with ride shares altogether this year.According to Ray Martinez, Ultra’s spokesman and security chief, Ultra has secured over 200 shuttles (the exact number is still being determined) to transport attendees from any of three shuttle stops in the city of Miami: the old Miami Herald site near the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts, AmericanAirlines Arena and Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. Each bus can carry 55 passengers, allowing for approximately 11,000 attendees to be moved at maximum capacity at any one time.Ferries will also be available for purchase (shuttles are free).The issue, however, isn’t getting attendees to the festival — it’s getting them out. Attendees are expected to come to the festival at a steady rate throughout the day. “But the end of the night will create a new dynamic for Ultra,” writes the , as up to 60,000 people leave each night.“Uber’s number one concern is the safety of our driver-partners and riders,” said Javi Correoso, Uber spokesman. “The event’s location poses significant logistical challenges, which is why we have flagged concerns and made recommendations to establish a transportation plan that prioritizes safety and efficiency.”“We have no idea whether it’s going to be one person using a rideshare company or 500,” said Key Biscayne Police Chief Charles Press. “Every car reduced from the causeway will help mitigate the traffic issues coming from the festival.”No parking will be made available to general admission attendees, and “on-site parking will only be offered to staff, attendees requiring special accommodations, vendors and to a limited number of VIP ticket holders,” says Martinez.Writes the , “Karla Damian, a spokeswoman for the Miami-Dade Department of Transportation and Public Works department, told the Herald that Ultra submitted a traffic plan in February that is still pending approval from multiple government departments. County administrators still need schematics showing pedestrian walkways and fencing along the causeway’s median.”  ferrylyftmiamiride shareshuttlestraffictransportationuberultra music festivalLover of all bass music.

Your EDM’s original exposé on the resort revealed dolphins being held in captivity — and sadly, one of the dolphins died just days after the music festival.Attempts to reach out to Bassnectar and Odesza, who also plan to throw a music festival of their own at the same resort, have proven unsuccessful. However, a response directly from the Bassnectar Network might be the closest thing we get to an official statement.In the Twitter thread below, a concerned fan addresses the situation:Bass Network directly responds:At the time of this writing, we have reached out again to Bassnectar’s team for additional comment and have not heard back. At this point, this is as official as it gets.RT if you would like to see the dolphinari shut down during deja next year! We need to protest this. If we’re for supporting the environment & end of animal cruelty we should not be allowing this on festival grounds.

"With only one artist left to unveil before the full Second Sky Festival lineup is revealed, Porter Robinson has just dropped a bomb on fans: Second Sky will be his only Worlds live set of 2019.The news, while disappointing, isn’t entirely shocking.  came out in 2014 and has been a live set staple of Porter’s ever since. But five years running and Virtual Self taking off, it makes sense that the Worlds live sets are slowing down.The good news is that Porter doesn’t say its the  Worlds live set, though we’re not necessarily ruling that out, either. We don’t expect a new Porter Robinson album in 2019, but one for 2020 is certainly likely. The last original Porter Robinson music that was released was “Shelter,” his collaboration with Madeon in 2016.According to the Second Sky website, this is the final artist announcement of the festival — no more blurred out names remain.

"2018 was a long, long year — for a lot of reasons. A lot of music was also released in those 12 months, including some truly global hits. IFPI, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, has just released their official list of the 10 biggest singles of 2018, and it’s quite an interesting look.Coming in at #1 is “Havana” from Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug. Writes “In June 2018, Havana became the most-streamed song ever by a female artist on Spotify with 888 million streams and has now clocked up 2.6 billion streams worldwide across all providers.” That it also measures up as the biggest song globally in 2018 is no surprise.“God’s Plan” by Drake was released January 19, 2018. (Remember what I said earlier about 2018 being a really, really long year? Yeah.) It’s no surprise either that this track makes it to the #2 spot, achieving global virality as well as meme status.Ed Sheeran scores the next two spots for “Shape Of You” and “Perfect,” both of which came out on his March 2017 album, . Clearly, though, their popularity persisted throughout 2018.The rest of the list hits popular tracks like “Despacito” and Post Malone’s “Psycho,” as well as Chinese artist Tia Ray for her track “Be Apart.”The Chainsmokers and Marshmello are, unsurprisingly, the only two electronic artists who ended up on the list; however, both were for ostensibly non-electronic songs, “Something Just Like This” and “Happier,” respectively.See the full top 10 list below! Official ChartsRukes.com camila cabellochainsmokersDrakeEd Sheeranglobal tracksifpimarshmelloThe Chainsmokerstop 10Lover of all bass music.

"The road to Gesaffelstein’s second studio album, , has been a roller coaster. Of course, when the dark prince of techno’s return was announced, the EDM community at large cheered and reveled in the news. And then we received “Reset,” which was accompanied by a hip hop-hating music video. Or was it? It was really hard to tell. Then he released “Lost In The Fire” with The Weeknd as the album’s second single, which ended up being criticized for its lyrics. The final single, “Blast Off” with Pharrell Williams, is a great Pharrell track — but not so much for Gesaffelstein.All of this is to say that as the album rollout continued, many if not most of Gesaffelstein’s original fans felt themselves becoming alienated by his new music. His new home on Columbia Records certainly had a small part to play in the album’s changing tone, but ultimately, this was not the Gesaffelstein that we had once known.And yet, now that is out in full, it has revealed itself to be a far more complex listen than the vapid pop tunes that had been released as singles. The 10-track album clocks in at 40 minutes, not least of all because of a 10-minute ambient track “Humanity Gone” that serves as the album’s closer. begins with the title track, “Hyperion,” a very intro-focused track that lands somewhere in between M83, Animal Collective, or MGMT. The repetitive synth loop is joined by a simple analog melody that ends up giving it an overwhelming psychedelic atmosphere — one could even say that it’s a bright and hopeful track. It sets a tone that is immediately flipped on its head by the following song, “Reset.”Whereas “Hyperion” was a beautifully arranged and ever-evolving track that brought many of Gesaffelstein’s strengths to the surface in new ways, “Reset” was comparably far more simple. The main beat for the track begins 10 seconds in and hardly wavers for the remainder of the 195 seconds except for an ambient bridge about halfway through. Immediately, listeners are hit with a dichotomy of sound and so far it’s a very confusing experience.This is then followed up by “Lost in the Fire,” the first vocal track on the album and Gesaffelstein’s third occasion teaming up with Abel. Even if you weren’t privy to the previously mentioned controversy over the lyrics, the line “while I fuck you straight” is so emphasized that it’s impossible to mix. It stands out so staunchly against the rest of the track, you can’t help but think, “Wait… what did he just say?” If not for the troubling nature of the lyrics, it hurts that it pulls you out of immersion in the track, as well.After these three wildly different tracks, we come to “Ever Now,” which, while it isn’t labeled as such, is really just an interlude. And yet, despite it being so short, the ambient and inquisitive nature of the track gives it a hypnotic quality that pulls you in and begs of you to want more. Following the first three tracks,  continues to present tracks at odds with each other, providing for an enigmatic listen, to say the least.Finally, we come back to “Blast Off,” the collaboration with Pharrell Williams. Curiously, “Blast Off” fits into the album far better than I anticipated when I first heard the single. It’s still incredibly simple and very safe, and still comes off as a better Pharrell track than Gesaffelstein track, but it’s far from the least impressive track on the album so far.Next up is “So Bad” with HAIM, easily one of the more wildcard tracks on the album. As it turns out, “So Bad” is quite sedative, playing with HAIM’s listless vocals against a mildly mesmerizing melody. It’s ultimately forgettable, which is unfortunate as this album needs every hit it can get.The other wildcard of the album, “Forever” with The Hacker and Electric Youth, is alternatively a fantastic song with depth that actually does a lot with the comparably listless vocals. The production is brighter with a more varied melody and some actual piano notes thrown in to break up the monotony. Compared to “So Bad,” this is easily the more enjoyable of the two.Going to the home stretch of the album, we’re presented with three instrumental tracks: “Vortex,” “Memora,” and “Humanity Gone.” Far and away, the final 16 or so minutes of the album are its strongest. While “Humanity Gone” alone is nearly 11 minutes, “Vortex” and “Memora” could have easily been combined into one 6-minute track, as well. The ambiance and dark production are more present here than anywhere else in the album, and it’s sad that it took this long to get here.It’s actually a neat little trick, too, when you think about it. You’ve spent so much time listening to two-star-out-of-five tracks on the album that when you finally get to the end, you’re met with 16 minutes of greatness. As you come out of it, experiencing recency bias first hand, you think to yourself, “Wow, that album was actually really good,” when in fact, you’re just remembering your favorite tracks because you’ve .But to zero in on “Humanity Gone” specifically for a moment, it is truly a phenomenal track. It’s just ten minutes of pure, ambient Gesaffelstein — it’s like swimming in his mind and getting pulled under a rip tide of emotion and swirling ethereal bliss. It’s interesting how the album manages to come full circle back to a more psychedelic ending after such a long string of forgettable singles.Ultimately, I would give  a 6.5/10. It’s not a bad album by any means, but aside from the final three tracks, there’s nothing in it that would make me want to come back and listen again. It’s certainly an album that everyone should listen to at least once, if not simply because it Gesaffelstein, then because it’s important to see how artists change over time — it’s a brilliant lesson in how to accept and deal with deviations from your expectations. albumbrilliantcolumbia recordsconfusingdarkgesaffelsteinHaimHyperionPharrell Williamssecond albumthe weekndLover of all bass music.

"When Marshmello first revealed he had a collaboration coming with CHVRCHES, fans were understandably skeptical. However, after listening to their new song “Here With Me” a number of times this morning, it’s easy to see that the two work together fantastically.“Here With Me” isn’t a particularly groundbreaking song for either artist, but its simplicity lets CHVRCHES lead singer Lauren Mayberry’s voice shine through brilliantly. Supported by a light guitar melody and some understated drums, the song remains catchy all the way through.As with any song under three minutes (“Here With Me” clocking in at 2 minutes, 36 seconds), I wish it was a bit longer. Maybe another bridge or some vocal embellishment in one of the verses would have been nice, but it’s still a great track nonetheless.Check out “Here With Me” by Marshmello featuring CHVRCHES below.[Verse 1]

"Kanye West‘s publishing contract with EMI is currently at the center of a complex lawsuit. Now, it’s been revealed to the public just how intense the terms are. For starters, he’s not allowed to retire — ever.The lawsuit details the terms of the publishing contract which states, West will “remain actively involved in writing, recording and producing Compositions and Major Label Albums, as Your principle occupation.” The agreement also states “at no time during the Term” will Kanye initiate a retirement or extended hiatus.Kanye is suing EMI and his label after his attempt to buy back his publishing rights failed. The famed rapper/producer is seeking “freedom” from his contracts in regards to publishing and recording. The “no retirement” bit is his best chance at gaining back control.His case references the California Labor Code section 2855 which states that personal service contracts may run no longer than seven years.

"2018 was an interesting year for now 19 year-old Chandler Riggs. Most well known for his time on the AMC hit show , Riggs has since departed from the show shocking many of the show’s most hardcore fans. However, it appears that Riggs is continuing to dabble with electronic music production with a little push from Steve Aoki.Chandler Riggs is now signed with Steve Aoki’s music discovery label New Noise. Under the name Eclipse, Riggs’ new single titled “Endeavor” is a creep of future bass that flips into a slapping hybrid of house and trap. This description can sound a little confusing, but the song itself is a perfect fit with Aoki’s imprint and worth checking out.But “Endeavor” is not Rigg’s first output of electronic music. Last year, Eclipse dropped four tracks under his . He even had a set at EDC Las Vegas in 2018 that certainly competes with what the music industry pros are up to.In an interview with KTLA, Riggs discussed the dual nature of his work in acting and in music saying,“I’m actually producing music kind of on the side, and I’m starting to play some shows and things like that. I’m doing that and acting, it’s quite a lot to juggle but it’s a lot of fun. I produce electronic kind of music, like EDM kind of stuff. Acting is awesome, but I’m really, really able to express myself creatively in music.”Although we won’t be seeing Rick Grimes calling out for “Caaaarl” anytime soon (since he’s also left ), we can now watch Chandler Riggs evolve as an artist in a genre he has always appreciated. And for fans of his acting, he’s currently appearing as a recurring character on ABC’s and will be featured in two upcoming films that are currently in post-production.Until then, check out “Endeavor” by Eclipse.Source:  bass musicchandler riggsdim makFuture Bassnew noisesteve aokithe walking deadMusic enthusiast would be an understatement.

"Martin Garrix released an entire album’s worth of material in 2018, so we understand that his side project AREA21 only put out one track last year. But we’re happy to see the duo with Maejor revived in 2019 for a new track, “HELP.”“HELP” is a bit more subdued than some of the past material from AREA21, putting more emphasis on the hip hop and downtempo production. The lyrics are also a bit more poignant and pointed than some of their previous tracks, tackling issues like human superficiality, materialism, and religious extremism.The lyrics are sung from the perspective of the AREA21 aliens approaching Earth and seeing the strife and conflict, and basically saying, “You know what, maybe we’ll come back another time.”Check out “HELP” from AREA21 below.[Pre-Chorus]

The goal is for the track to achieve #1 status, so don’t be afraid to hit that repeat button.The idea is bigger than just topping the charts, however. The petition reads:Flint is remembered by his bandmates as a “a true pioneer, innovator and legend.” The entire dance music community echoes the same.The Prodigy have since cancelled all of their upcoming tour dates, including Glastonbury 2019.See the event here, get involved, and listen below.

"Getter is determined to get fans onboard with his new Visceral , even if that means switching it up.The album was utterly spectacular — one of our Top 10 favorites to come out of 2018 — and the entire tour centers around that body of work. Some fans totally dig the lighter, melodic vibe, but some others who prefer his older, heavier material have been critical.In a new social post, Getter opens up about the  and the feedback he’s been receiving from fans. (See more comments from fellow DJs below).been thinking about the criticism of the visceral tour so far and have started to adjust a lot of shit in the performanceit doesn’t make sense for me to expect everyone from previous shows to be 100% down w the new stuffima make this super special thanks for the pointers 😊— 𝕲𝖊𝖙𝖙𝖊𝖗 (@GetterOfficial) March 7, 2019From the sounds of it, Getter is switching up his act to adhere to a broader audience and, moving forward, the tour will sound a little different. We’re a little torn about this, because we’d love nothing more than for Getter to stick to his guns. On the other hand, it’s understandable that he wants to please the people paying for a ticket.Personally, I’m looking forward to seeing Getter’s  set at Buku and wouldn’t want him to change a thing. Sometimes, supporting an artist means being 100% down with whatever they want to share with you in that moment.Get tickets to see Getter live here.Fuk dat. Dont let ppl make you feel that the way. Display your art the way you want to. Its not the fans decision on what you play. You dont want those ppl coming to your shows ne ways if they gonna bitch it isnt like ur old shows— BRIDDIM BOY🐘 (@woolimusic) March 7, 2019The album is so beautiful dude. I can understand y it might b jarring for a lot of huge fans of your previous albums/releases, but Im def bummed they couldnt be a lil more open to what you’re doing and the amazing new stuff you’ve been creating.

"Audien is taking 2019 by storm! Fresh off his huge remix for Calvin Harris, the Grammy-nominated producer is back with another huge collaboration. This time Audien teams up with alt-pop trio Echosmith to bring us “Favorite Sound” a bouncy, vibrant empowerment anthem. Audien co-wrote the song with Echosmith lead singer Sydney Sierota and he said their goal was “to create something super pretty and meaningful.” Mission accomplished. With masterful production by Audien, soaring vocals from Sydney, and some live instrumentation from Echosmith that brings a new dimension to Audien’s style.We got the chance to chat with Audien (real name Nate Rathbun) and Sydney to talk about “Favorite Sound,” how they came together for the song, what they learned from each other, touring and their big plans for 2019.

"A local Oakland music festival called  made a lot of noise today regarding Porter Robinson & Goldenvoice’s new Multiverse Festival. In an Instagram post earlier today (the account has since gone private), event organizers Jade Ariana and Shawna Shawnte wrote that Porter Robinson & Goldenvoice’s Multiverse Festival is “a continuation of the ongoing violence and discrepancies in power that continue to produce disenfranchisement within cultural production.”Doing their best to be respectful to the event, which has gone on in Oakland since 2017, Multiverse festival has officially been renamed Second Sky Fest. The event will remain at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in Oakland on June 15.“a couple days ago we found out about another oakland music event called ‘the multivrs is illuminated’ — i feel like the right thing to do is to change the name of our festival,” wrote Porter.“it took a little time to sort out the logistics, but we’re changing it to Second Sky Music Festival!”With regards to Ariana and Shawnte’s other demands, that Porter and Goldenvoice essentially pay reparations so that Multivrs can continue to throw events, no comment was made. Rukes.com Goldenvoicemultiverseoaklandporter robinsonsecond sky festupdateLover of all bass music.

"Ketamine might have a reputation as a “party drug,” but its chemical cousin now doubles as a legitimate treatment to fight depression. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) just approved Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.‘s esketamine, which is marketed as Spravato.Spravato is a nasal spray that may be used by patients with treatment-resistant depression. In other words, candidates must have a history of depression and have tried at least two other medications without success. For best results, it should be taken as a supplement to a prescribed oral antidepressant.The drug may be used once a week or once every other week, depending on the severity of depression in the patient. The nasal spray must be administered inside a doctor’s office or a medical clinic, or self-administered under supervision of a health care provider. It cannot be taken home.Side effects include: “dizziness, nausea, vertigo, anxiety, lethargy, increased blood pressure, vomiting, feeling drunk, decreased sensitivity, sedation.” Also, “dissociation, a feeling of being temporarily ‘disconnected’ from your body and your mind.”More info straight from the press release: “Esketamine is the s-enantiomer of ketamine. Ketamine is a mixture of two enantiomers (mirror image molecules). This is the first FDA approval of esketamine for any use. The FDA approved ketamine (Ketalar) in 1970.”According to a report, current depression treatments are considered ineffective in a staggering 30 – 40 percent of cases. Symbyax is the only other FDA-approved medication for treatment-resistant depression.Read the full press release via FDA here. CNN DepressiondrugfdaKetamineSpravato",articles6,['Ketamine']
"For the longest time, Deadmau5‘s testpilot techno alias has been something that he’s pulled out only on select occasions. But, as the alias has seen a comparably larger festival presence in the past year or so, it seems that it is becoming more of a regular fixture for the artist.This presumption is reinforced by the fact that various social media accounts have just been registered for testpilot on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram: @toliptset.Mau5trap actually tweeted out the new handle with a photo of the (presumed) new testpilot logo/avatar and captioned it “Friday,” suggesting we may even get an official release from this alias tomorrow.Stay tuned to find out more!friday [@toliptset] pic.twitter.com/XTTAFF2sD4— mau5trap (@mau5trap) March 6, 2019 Rukes.com deadmau5fridaymau5trapsocial mediateasertestpilotLover of all bass music.

That being said, this year is about to blow that out of the water. The event will feature surprise performances from 8 of the best DJs in the world, hand-picked by Shaq, celebrity guests, a carnival experience, dozens of interactive circus performers, plenty of food options, a premium open bar and many more Shaq-sized surprises.“The artist roster for this year’s Shaq’s Fun House Miami will surpass even last year’s epic lineup.” said Shaquille O’Neal. “The lineup is a Shaq-sized surprise and what is even crazier is the Fun House experience JBL and I are putting on.

"Performers are not infallible. There are plenty times in the careers of a DJ, actor, comedian, athlete or what have you that they are not in peak physical condition — and yet, they soldier on and deliver a worthy performance because it is their job and they’re passionate about their craft.Yesterday, beginning with a rather innocuous comment from Rezz, Jauz shared his own horror story of being on stage in Vegas with a raging fever: “it was one of the best residency shows I ever did, I ended up giving so much energy during the set and then when it was done I literally couldn’t walk back up the stairs to my hotel.”I played a day club show in Vegas once with a 104 degree fever and it was one of the best residency shows I ever did, I ended up giving so much energy during the set and then when it was done I litterally couldn’t walk back up the stairs to my hotel 😂— JAUZ (@Jauzofficial) March 7, 2019From there, Rezz got the idea to ask others about their own “performance horror stories,” and let me tell you, the floodgates opened.

"Deaths in the U.S. from alcohol, drugs and suicide have hit an all-time high.A new study gathers that there are more recent American deaths related to drugs, alcohol abuse and suicides than during any other point over the last two decades. In 2017, the number of reported deaths under these circumstances hit the highest level since record-keeping began in 1999.National death rates from drugs, alcohol and suicide rose by 6 percent in 2019. That’s 43.9 to 46.6 deaths per every 100,000 people. It was a slower increase than the previous two years, but over the average 4 percent increase reported since 1999. These are number calculated by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Deaths from suicides alone saw 4 percent increase, with 13.9 to 14.5 deaths per every 100,000 people. Meanwhile, deaths from synthetic opioids including fentanyl rose 45 percent and overall increased tenfold over the past five years.Recently, music lost a legend — Keith Flint of The Prodigy took his own life. Last year, Avicii passed away tragically in an apparent suicide. These are just two people.

"After announcing his collaboration with CHVRCHES last Friday, Marshmello has finally given fans their first listen to the record, called “Here With Me.”Out this Friday, “Here With Me” seems to go more the way of “Wolves” or “Happier,” as opposed to his own  material. This dichotomy has always existed in de facto fashion, but it’s definitely becoming more clear cut with each new pop collaboration that Marshmello puts out.That being said, the 19-second preview that we get is far too little to get any real idea of what the song will sound like. The verse shared is probably from the very beginning or end of the song, and is only CHVCHES with some acoustic guitar.Fans will be able to hear “Here With Me” in full this Friday.Pre-Save “Here With Me” before Friday! @CHVRCHES https://t.co/LDZgXDRi06 pic.twitter.com/l3RdRfzIVd— marshmello (@marshmellomusic) March 4, 2019 Rukes.com CHVRCHESfirst listenhere with memarshmellopreviewLover of all bass music.

The club will debut the first weekend in April with performances from Marshmello, Travis Scott, Cardi B, Alicia Keys, J Balvin, Skrillex, and G-Eazy, with more artists set to perform throughout the year.According to a new report from , Marshmello has signed an exclusive two-year contract with the Las Vegas club to the tune of $60 million. With a guaranteed $30 million per year (gross) from the residency, as well as streaming, touring, sync, and merchandise, this will surely make Marshmello the new richest DJ in the world.In their highest-paid DJs of 2018 article, Forbes revealed Marshmello made approximately $23 million. This residency alone is worth more than everything he made in that twelve month period (June 1, 2017 through June 1, 2018), which is astounding. The highest-paid DJ at the time, Calvin Harris, doesn’t tour. Instead, he makes most of his money from streaming and residencies in Las Vegas.Moe Shalizi, founder and CEO of The Shalizi Group, who manages Marshmello, said: “The Palms has always been one of the most iconic hotels, so it’s very exciting to announce that this will be our new home in Las Vegas. To be part of this legacy’s newest chapter is an honor.

"TroyBoi dropped a new ID with Skrillex on an unexpecting crowd over the weekend… and here it is!The bulk of the production — or at least what we can hear of it — sounds unmistakably like TroyBoi. However, there’s just enough Skrillex flair in there to keep it fresh. The low, wonky beat can be attributed to TroyBoi and the higher vocal chops are most definitely the work of Skrillex. Together, they find a nice mix.To the fans wondering if this is indeed a collaboration with Skrilly, the tag around 5 – 6 seconds in is a dead giveaway. With fans yearning for new material from the producer, this is more than enough to perk up those ears. We could be hearing the early workings of a future official release.Listen below and pray to the bass gods that this track sees the light of day soon!

"Virginia’s newly instated tobacco regulation has raised the general purchase age from 18 to 21. The bill (HB 2748) was just signed into law by Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on Thursday, but will officially go into effect on July 1.This comes as the U.S. Surgeon General has declared teenage vaping as an epidemic. The amended tobacco law is meant to discourage teens from using e-cigarettes and vapes. It does, however, exempt active duty military personnel.“By raising the minimum age for purchase to 21, this will have a positive effect on our schools by lessening the chances of teenagers obtaining vaping products from friends and classmates who are already 18,” Republican House Speaker Kirk Cox said.Surely, this will deter many of those ages 18, 19 and 20 from purchasing tobacco products. But, only time will tell if the law successfully curbs the epidemic altogether.Meanwhile, local businesses across the state of Virginia are gearing up for a big hit come this summer.Do you think raising the tobacco purchaser age from 18 to 21 is a good idea?

"With one week left until the release of Gesaffelstein’s new album , he has dropped one final single, “Blast Off” featuring Pharrell Williams.“Blast Off” follows previously released tracks “Lost in the Fire” featuring The Weeknd and “ResetWe’ve heard Pharrell be a phenomenal vocalist, especially on “Get Lucky” with Daft Punk, but his talents seem wasted on this repetitive and uninspiring single. There’s a chance my opinion could change when I hear the whole album in its entirety and see how each track fits into each other, but as a single, this is wholly forgettable.The rollout of Gesaffelstein’s new album has been somewhat lackluster. After news broke that he had signed with Columbia Records, home now of Swedish House Mafia and Daft Punk, fans were (rightly) concerned that he would be going a more pop route. As it stands, their fears have been substantiated.Listen to “Blast Off” below.[Verse 1]
You’ve been thinking about this all night
All week saying this was right
Cross your heart and hope to die
Are you sure you wanna pay the price?
Do it outside in the night
’Cause where you going is the life[Chorus]
When I’m looking in your face
(Oh, higher, higher)
You give me faith
(Oh, high up in the sky)
I feel this faith
(Oh, higher, higher)
This must be fate
(Oh, high up in the sky)
What do I know?[Verse 2]
Saying that you wanna know
What it feels like to let go
Everything that was before
Should you do it in the youth?
Be enlightened, feel the truth
But the serotonin [?][Chorus]
When I’m looking in your face
(Oh, higher, higher)
You give me faith
(Oh, high up in the sky)
I feel this faith
(Oh, higher, higher)
This must be fate
(Oh, high up in the sky)
What do I know?[Bridge]
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
To look in your eyes when you see the vision
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
I need somebody, I need a witness
To look in your eyes when you see the vision
Late night (Late night), decisions (Decisions)
Do you wanna (Do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)
Late night (Late night), decisions (Decisions)
Do you wanna (Do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)
Late night (Late night), decisions (Decisions)
Do you wanna (Do you wanna?) be lifted? (Be lifted)
Late night (Late night), decisions (Decisions)
Hello (Hello) spirit
Blast off[Verse 3]
Hold on tight, hold on for life
If this is what you like
Do it all night
Girl, I don’t gotta fly
I just wanna ride
Back and forth, left and right
Ain’t tryna be slick
But I just wanna slide
Or I can be a kite, and I can just fly
Away with the birds
Call sky
High, high, high, high
Backroad trails, follow the line
Coming from, still birds in the sky (Oh yeah)
Bunch of horses herd in the sky
Stare too long, you’ll be hurting your eye
How does it feel to be on this side?
The sunshine, the all-seeing eye
Like ayy, like a lightning strike
Into your body and up through your mind
And into your spirit, and your spirit does fly
Floating high, landing high
Away into the light
[?] in for a dime
Again[Chorus]
When I’m looking in your face
(Oh, higher, higher)
You give me faith
(Oh, high up in the sky)
I feel this faith
(Oh, higher, higher)
This must be fate
(Oh, high up in the sky)

"Day two of Bassnectar’s Deja Voom is done, and it’s certainly staying interesting. After porn star Adriana Chechik was filmed performing oral sex on an attendee in the crowd on Thursday night, the resort is now cracking down on drug use after “some unfortunate incidents.”“[…] the resort has informed us that they are required to be proactive in enforcing Mexico’s zero-tolerance policy with enhanced security measures including the use of specially-trained dogs,” the notice reads. “Please be aware that you may see increased security within the entire resort including all Deja Voom events and activities effective immediately through check-out.”Heads up if you are at #DejaVoom — Drug dogs are potentially being brought onsite and a 0% tolerance policy is now in effect.@CID_Presents @bassnectar @dejavoom pic.twitter.com/5EZ0SeKIis— Festive Owl (@TheFestiveOwl) March 2, 2019Chicago-based booking agency Almost Famous adds, “be careful, drug dogs searching rooms now.

"UPDATE 3/6 | A dolphin at Barcelo Maya Beach resort, Plata, has now reportedly died according to watch group Dolphin Freedom MX. Read the report here.Thousands of fans are gathered in Riviera Maya, Mexico this week to celebrate the inaugural Deja Voom festival thrown by Bassnectar. With a beautiful ocean backdrop and 5-star resort as the festival setting, it seems like paradise. However, there’s a darker side to the story.The resort the festival is held at, Barceló Maya Beach, also features an attraction wherein guests can view dolphins in captivity for free, or pay to ride them and interact with them within the enclosure. Although the company that runs the attraction, Dolphinaris, claims to have achieved certification through the global American Humane Conservation program for “the welfare and humane treatment of the animals under its care,” animal rights activists and resort attendees have condemned the facility for their treatment of the animals.Dolphinaris has five locations on the Yucatan peninsula, all within 114 miles of each other: Cancún, Cozumel, Riviera Maya, Tulum, and Barceló. Though no explicit information is publicly available about the size of the Barceló enclosure, it stands to reason that it is similar in size to the others.This blog post describing the conditions at the Tulum site puts the depth of the enclosure anywhere between 3-5 meters deep. The familiar bottlenose dolphin grows to approximately 2.5 meters long, which if the minimum depth is true is akin to explicit animal torture. Even at the maximum depth estimated, it’s still clearly animal cruelty with hardly enough space to move. Photos from Trip Advisor for the Barceló location appear that the enclosure is perhaps even smaller than the one at Tulum.Furthermore, dolphins held in shallow enclosures like this with very little protection from the sun can actually become sunburnt, and appear a darker color because of it.A sixth Dolphinaris location was open in Arizona until just last month, when it closed after its fourth dolphin died in a span of two years. ANIMALS 24-7, a nonprofit online newspaper and information service covering the humane community worldwide, alleges that as many as nine dolphins have died at Dolphinaris locations altogether in the same time span (May 22,  2018 thru January 31,  2019).“We recognize losing four dolphins over the last year and a half is abnormal,” Dolphinaris general manager Christian Schaeffer said in a statement. “We will be taking proactive measures to increase our collaborative efforts to further ensure our dolphins’ well-being and high quality of life.”ANIMALS 24-7 reports Dolphinaris Arizona was closed “temporarily,” ostensibly for an expert review of the facilities, on February 8,  2019. Signage identifying the buildings was taken down on February 15, 2019.Dolphinaris likes to use promotional materials claiming they are helping the environment, like this blog post about cleaning beaches in Cancun and Riviera Maya from 2017.“Dolphinaris has always been committed to the conservation of marine environments,” the post reads.However, the continued confinement of such intelligent creatures is entirely at adds with that commitment.This outrage isn’t just coming from animal rights activists, but also from those within the Bassnectar fandom and EDM in general, as well.The Barcelo Hotel keeps dolphin in captivity. Please dont support businesses that do cruel shit. You will be facing them at the other end of the resort from the stage— mark c (@Livemusicstyle1) February 13, 2019I honestly can’t believe that #DejaVoom is held at a resort that supports animal cruelty. Dolphins should not be kept in small tanks for entertainment. @bassnectar pretty disappointed here. pic.twitter.com/D5lHLT8QvW— lauren elizabeth (@okbiiiitch) March 1, 2019ODESZA will host their own festival, Sundara, at the same Barceló Maya Beach resort in just two weeks, March 13-16, 2019.Your EDM has reached out to both ODESZA’s and Bassnectar’s teams and will update with their responses. animal crueltybassnectarcaptivityDeja VoomdolphinarisdolphinsmexicoodeszasundaraLover of all bass music.

"Legendary Swedish dance-pop singer Robyn made here triumphant return to Los Angeles last month. Partnering with Red Bull Music Festival, Robyn delighted two sold out nights at the legendary Hollywood Palladium. The L.A. dates were her first in the U.S. in support of her recently released album , as well as her first solo dates in Los Angeles since 2010 (she played the Hollywood Bowl with Röyksopp in 2014).   marked Robyn’s first solo work in eight years, so as you can imagine, fans were lined up and ready for this show.Taking the stage in front of a billowy white backdrop that seemed reminiscent of heaven, Robyn and her live band wowed the crowd with a nice mix of songs of Honey, such as “Send to Robin Immediately” and “Human Being”, as well as classics like “Don’t Fucking Tell Me What to Do” and of course, “Dancing on My Own.” Complete with multiple wardrobe changes and impromptu dance numbers from Robyn and her crew, Red Bull and Robyn delivered a night to remember for Los Angeles.Robyn still has a few dates left on the North American leg of the Honey Tour.

"Dillon Francis dropped his wildly popular  EP in 2015, a year after he dropped his debut album . Containing collaborations with Calvin Harris, Skrillex, Kygo, Chromeo, and Bro Safari, along with a Party Favor remix, it remains one of Dillon’s strongest collections of tracks.Now, following the release of his divisive sophomore album , it seems a sequel is in order.“New music for This Mixtape Is Fire 2,” Dillon tweeted, in response to a fan question about a song on his Snap story. That was enough to send fans into a frenzy with dozens of tweet replies and a thread on Reddit. The tweet has since been deleted, but see it below.As if the tweet wasn’t enough, Dillon actually popped into the aforementioned Reddit thread and announced, “Back on my bullshit. Get Ready”That much is already clear with his newest single “EDM O’ CLOCK” released yesterday with TV Noise. Safe to say, 2019 is going to be a much different year release-wise for Dillon than 2018.

Two months later, it had passed one billion views on YouTube — which, at the time, was still very rare. It was the first EDM music video to pass that threshold.Two years later, it hit 2 billion.And two months after , it became just the fourth track ever to hit one billion streams on Spotify.It’s safe to say that this song has quite a history behind it, and it still sounds just as good as ever.

"Disneyland might not be the first place people think of when they planning for a rave, but the parks have a deeper connection to EDM and rave culture than one might think. Every year there’s Raver Day at the Disneyland Park in Anaheim where passholders wear their best rave gear to the parks (and probably freak out the kids). There’s also the new night time show “Mickey’s Magic Mix” which portrays Mickey Mouse as a virtual DJ, involving a visual projection show EDC would be proud of and a esque Disney soundtrack that could use the touch of actual DJ’s. Sorry Mickey. And no one should forget the brilliance that was , the Star Wars-themed album released by Hollywood Records, produced by an insanely talented group of DJs such as Kaskade, TroyBoi, Claude VonStroke, 3lau, and Bonobo.However, if you want to attend an actual rave in the park you will have to travel to Disneyland Paris for Electroland.For its third edition, taking place the July 5-7, 2019, Electroland takes you down the rabbit hole and into the jungle for a unique rave experience in the Walt Disney Studios Park. Those planning to attend can look forward to all the fun of magical universe of Disneyland Paris and its attractions while dancing to DJs such as Steve Aoki, Alesso, Armin Van Buuren, Nora En Pure, and The Magician while enjoying magical projections on The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. See the full lineup for the upcoming rave at the Parisian house of the mouse below:You can find tickets on the official site of Disneyland Paris. Not Paris ready? Can’t wait till July to get your Mickey Mouse on? Feel free to revisit what I feel is one of the best themed EDM albums of all time. I’m still hoping there’s a surprise performance of this album when Star Wars Land officially opens in Anaheim later this year.

"Marshmello is bringing Dotcom back in 2019 and he’s already testing out new music!Christopher Comstock’s Dotcom moniker took a backseat to Marshmello in 2015, when he shifted gears and gained early support from Skrillex on his new project. First came his self-released debut  in 2016 and the rest is history. From mystery DJ to masked phenomenon to household name — Marshmello has achieved mainstream recognition.As for Dotcom, OG fans have been missing the project and itching for a comeback.

"Brooklyn-based Serbian artist X-Coast is at heart of today's underground communityWith a knack for delivering raucous and ravey DJ sets and producing smooth and sensual dancefloor anthems, X-Coast is at the heart of today's underground dance music community.Growing up in Yugoslavia and now based out of Brooklyn, X-Coast's diverse musical roots shine through his stacked catalogue of releases. He first gained traction with his 'Mango Bay' EP in 2015 - featuring a warm and soulful house essence - with a title track that rapidly swept through the scene and racked up over 1 million plays on YouTube. His next releases would further showcase more of his unique style, with an EP on Mall Grab's Steel City Dance Discs that provided more nostalgic house flavours while his material on the Shall Not Fade sub-label Lost Palms and UNDERTHESEA brought forth more energy and rave motifs. To continue his ascent, recent releases on Hot Haus Recs and Dansu Discs only solidify his place within the new crop of influential tastemakers.Now with a residency at NYC hotpot Elsewhere and his latest release on Big Beat Records, titled 'Mi Sabor', proving to do damage on dancefloors around the world, X-Coast is taking more strides to broaden his reach over dance music culture.Check out X-Coast's exclusive mix and Q+A below.What are some of the early electronic records that made a serious impact on your sound? When did you start diving into the world of electronic music?Yugoslavia (Serbia) during the 90s was at war and under sanctions. With all the import being held, there was no music releases officially coming in. We had to rely on Bulgarian pirated/bootlegged cassettes and CDs, or someone going abroad and smuggling the originals. I had a neighbor who was older than me - shout out to Mika if he's reading - and I remember him always blasting these sick sounds. I just had to get my hands on that. This was '96, and some cassettes I remember were The Prodigy collection, Thunderdome IX & XI were especially popular in the hood, 'Jungle Beats - Wicked & Wild' compilation got me into jungle. Also, I used to send cassettes and some money in an envelope by mail to Noise Destruction's studio, the electronic music pioneers in Serbia, and I would write down which CDs from their collection I wanted copied - I remember obtaining a few X-Mixes that way. I definitely owe it to the pirates for shaping my musical taste. Also TV was much different, MTV Party, Chillout Zone, Viva Housefrau, Berlin House and some local rave shows were playing amazing stuff. I just remembered that I found some CDs in my parents attic a few months back.How did you first get into DJing and producing? Can you tell us a little about your first music project?Somewhere in '98 that same neighbor passed me a floppy disc with a copy of Fasttracker 2 - supposedly, many of our favorite producers at the time were using it - unfortunately the floppy was corrupt.It was in 1999 that I got my hands on a copy of Future Music magazine that had a demo version of Propellerhead's ReBirth, basically an emulation of 2x303, 1x808 & 1x909. Even though I could not save my work and could only use it for 20 minutes before the demo locked me out and played the last loop into eternity, this was everything to me. The first name I went by was Cell D. The DJing came later. Around 2002 I started buying records imported from Hungary to a local shop in my hometown of Novi Sad. For me, every Friday, when the fresh shipment would arrive, was a holiday - DJs from all over the region, even some big cats, would come in to check out the new arrivals. I was heavily into Drum 'n' Bass at that point, but it was great listening to other people's selections - the shop had only one pair of decks, so you would have to blast out your records in front of everyone and get your selection judged by a jaded old club owner sitting in the corner. Played my first show in 2003, so basically I've been playing music for the half of my life. Here's one of my first promo mixes.You are originally from Serbia but now based in NYC, what attracted to you to the city and what are your thoughts on the dance music community there?Yes, New York is quite different than Serbia. This city is not what it seems to be looking from the outside, but definitely has many faces. I was attracted by the DIY scene and the city's music history. The DIY scene is hanging by a thread and the history... well no one remembers history, there's no money to be made there. Still, we survive. I was just chatting to somebody last night and they said how we all got tricked into moving to NYC. I love my neighborhood tho, shout out to everyone on Myrtle & Broadway.What do you have planned in 2019?Setting up a record label - Riviera Records. Working on some videos. Bringing out some friends to the X-Coast Elsewhere residency happening on Thursdays throughout April. Excited for a special new collaboration that just started and about to do some more kPax tracks with my old partner in crime DJ RaDa/M-Tech. As a human being, I'm hoping to finally break free from the shackles of X-Coast, should they succeed in finding a new vessel to represent them on planet earth.What type of music did you include in your Impact mix and how did you approach putting it together?Similar to the live shows, this mix tries to describe the feeling of one stepping through the portal to X-Coast. Best of old, best of new - from the present point of view - we go deep into the past to predict the future. I'm trying to pin down this unique energy which occurs somewhere in between these sounds mixed together and create the ""X-Coast effect"" - the closest thing I can describe to this is a flashback. If you get it, you get it... Plainly speaking, it's like stumbling upon your cool older brothers cassette mixtape. I also go through phases of over-analyzing work by some of the producers I admire, which results in having quite a number of tracks by that person(s) or their monikers in a mix. This one goes out to Roland Faber.

"Jayda G talks us through her exclusive Cover MixJayda G only deals in the most joyous and life-giving selections going. She radiates an energy behind the decks that it’s impossible not to lose yourself in, moving through r’n’b, disco and house cuts with electrifying flair.Now a certified star with a debut album 'Significant Changes' coming on Ninja Tune, we're thrilled to have Jayda G fronting our April issue and delivering us an exclusive Cover Mix to mark the occasion. Turn it up loud and get your spirits soaring to the stratosphere.Listen to her exclusive mix and read Jayda G talking us through each selection below.1. Fonda Rae ‘Heboah’“I wanted to start off the mix with a positive uplifting disco tune. This track has Fonda Rae singing – you may know her better from ‘Over Like A Fat Rat’ produced by Darryl Payne. Can’t remember when I came across this track but it has a groove that infuses me with happiness”2. Beckie Bell ‘Music Madness’“I was incredibly happy when this track got re-pressed on Favorite Recordings. Classic sounding disco by the great Pierre Berjot. He produced so many of my favourite disco tunes such as ‘Get Another Love’ by Chantal Curtis”3. Carol Williams ‘You Have Reached the Bottom Line’“I remember discovering Carol Williams when I was living in LA. She always stuck with me. It’s really funny – Carol Williams apparently passed on recording ‘Over Like A Fat Rat’ with Darryl Payne that Fonda Rae ended up doing (referenced in the first song). A little disco trivia for you!”4. Matrix ‘Stay (I Need Your Love)’From the Italian producer Sangy who also produced Firefly (I’m a big fan of their song ‘Love [Is Gonna Be On Your Side]’). I love the guitar solo and the synthesiser bassline. There’s something about early 80s disco where things are a bit cheesy but just enough for me, and also I’m a sucker for a killer slap bass”5. Con Funk Shun ‘Get Down With It’“We’re jumping back a few years now to the late 70s: less synthesiser and a more funky groove. The pressing I have here |is a Canadian pressing”6. Johnny King & The Fatback Band ‘Peace Love Not War’“I found this in New York a few months ago. This is the Kenny Dope extended mix, but the track is originally from the late 60s. Love the guitar solo with the build toward the ends. I really gravitate towards songs where the singer is really letting loose, it just helps you feel the energy of the track”7. Innerzone Orchestra ‘Bugs In the Bass Bin’ (Jazz mix)“This track is by Innerzone Orchestra aka Carl Craig. Such a fantastic mix of both jazz and electronic music”8. Herbert ‘Fat King Fire’“There’s something about the melody in this track that makes me feel super nostalgic. I was listening to a lot of this strange mixture of heavy deep house sounds with a light melody around 2010ish (though this track was made in 1996)”9. Janet Rushmore ‘Joy (Kaoz Gone Insane)’“I got this record on my first visit to A1 Records, a long time ago now. A 90s house classic in my opinion. Kerri Chandler’s imprint is on this one for sure”10. Mike Grant ‘The Struggle Of My People’ (Mr G’s There’s Hope mix)“I’m a big fan of both Mike Grant and Mr G – and an even bigger fan of the great Maya Angelou who is sampled in this track”11. Unreleased/Untitled“Check it!”12. Thaddeus Nelson Jr ‘Wild Inn’“I pitched this song super slow. It gives it a more chugging feel, which I like. A bit more deep and dark with this track”13. First Choice ‘Double Cross’ (Traxx mix)“I love the piano chords! I’m a big fan of First Choice in general. I love finding 90s house remakes of disco classics. So fun”14. Peven Everett ‘Feelin’ You In and Out’“There’s something in this song that really emulates where I would want a set to be at the end of the night... just closing your eyes and dancing”15. Aaron-Carl ‘Sky’“From the amazing Mahogani Music. The chord progression has a deep house, uplifting feel to it”16. N’Dambi ‘Call Me (Re-Edit)’“Love this – it makes my heart sing! A great track to end a set, N’Dambi’s r’n’b vocals are just so smooth. Gives me life!”Anyways, hope you enjoyed the mix, friends!

A mixed bag of beloved classics, Lenny and Lawrence Burden show us that sometimes, the best way to prepare for an epic techno set is to clear your mind and take yourself outside of the genre completely.Vujaday Festival is a five-day event taking place April 3 - 7 that will unfold all throughout Barbados.

"Powered byBassiani resident Lilith. is pushing things forward in a scene united against chaos and confrontationKhatia Tkavashvili, known by her DJ name Lilith., is a rising Central Asian artist and the only woman resident at Georgia’s booming techno haunt Bassiani. Since opening its doors in 2014, Bassiani has surged to fame in the underground and become a sanctuary for the LGBTQ+ community in Tbilisi. Bassiani has almost a cult-like following among Georgian ravers, who use the space to freely express themselves and escape on the dancefloor.Georgia is a gateway to Central Asia and just a stone’s throw away from Europe. Lilith. grew up in Tbilisi during a period of immense social change after the fall of the Soviet Union, when Georgia was just beginning to define its own path as an independent country.Despite the country’s close proximity to Europe, walking around parts of Tbilisi can feel like stepping backwards in time by 20 years, with its spiralling turrets and Soviet relics. But there are also many newer and trendier cavities of the city, like the city’s only record store that is always lively with customers, LGBTQ+-friendly bars, and new clubbing institutions like Bassiani that are dedicated to inclusion and progression.These contrasts in the older and newer parts of Tbilisi almost physically represent Georgia’s generational gap in thinking. Most younger Georgians are keen to embrace the liberalism of Europe, while much of the older generation still hold out-dated conservative views on homosexuality and race.Often compared to the notorious Berghain, Tbilisi club Bassiani has splashed the headlines over the past year when Georgian authorities threatened to close the club down for reasons related to illegal drug use.In May last year and in the thick of a happy cohort of dancers, armed police raided the club, rounding up ravers and DJs against a wall as they endeavoured to make the party stop forever. Lilith. and her fellow residents at the club were at the forefront of the closure, and watched as authorities attempted to dismantle the special space that they have worked tirelessly to create for Georgians and international visitors alike. “We dance together, we fight together” - the slogan of the Bassiani protests has now become a famous motto of resistance, and the protests are a very real example of how dance music can help fight violent oppression.The establishment of Bassiani helped nourish a community of electronic artists in Tbilisi and wider Georgia. Access to this community has helped Lilith. refine her skills to the level they are today - performing at Bassiani on a regular basis as a resident and playing for crowds elsewhere in Georgia and Central Asia.Despite Bassiani’s prolific reputation in the clubbing sphere, Central Asian artists still receive limited international exposure. Practical issues, such as a weak economy and a lack of an established clubbing culture in Central Asia have contributed to this. But as Bassiani’s notoriety grows, people like Lilith. and other Bassiani residents, such as HVL and Zitto, are having a greater impact on the industry and on how we consume music from this part of the world.Check out Lilith.'s exclusive mix and Q+A below.It is mentioned in your Bassiani profile that you draw on a wide range of musical styles as inspiration. What are your earliest memories of electronic music?My first memories are of my parents’ tape-recorder. Using it, I used to listen to the radio continuously. They also had a record-player and records, and their collection included psychedelic rock, pop, soul, r'n'b and funk. But later when the internet came about, my music taste changed and I delved into genres like industrial, ambient, glitch, post-punk, synth pop, IDM, and much more. Throughout my whole life, music has always played a great role.

Can you describe your experience of growing up in post-Soviet Georgia?

I was born during the revolutionary events and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Because of this and the drastic change in the system that affected the previous generation to such a huge extent, it also shaped my generation and me - we were the people of the transitional stage. I must acknowledge that it’s extremely difficult to live in Tbilisi but exciting at the same time, and even now I witness events and change taking place. The fact that Tbilisi is today going through the processes which most European countries have already experienced makes it really interesting to live through.For me personally, it’s important to be a part of these processes and participate in them. My generation is making an attempt to act in this country and are determined to change things. For this to happen, it’s vital to always look to the events taking place and aim to understand them clearly so that we can be prepared for any threats to progress.

Within that context, what inspired you to get into DJing? Were you able to build a community that had a similar way of viewing these social changes to you?

I was a frequent visitor to nightclubs at an early age, but if I had to pinpoint a turning point for my relationship with clubbing culture, it would be Kreidler’s live set, which I attended at one of Tbilisi’s clubs. After that, I got really interested in DJing and production. Soon after that I was given an opportunity to learn how to play and I started playing at clubs. At the same moment that I started playing, Georgian electronic music was rapidly developing, and I was in a circle where we were all shaping and creating the scene that’s continuing in Georgia today.

All of the residents at Bassiani have very unique approaches and styles. What emotions or stories do you try to portray in your sets?

All sets are individual and I approach them as if I am crafting a musical composition. I try to bring varied sounds to my listeners. All of my sets have their own stories which start with me, and then at some point during the set, the music becomes independent and can be interpreted individually by the listener.

As my experience continues to grow, my sets tend to change in character and style. In the initial stages of DJing, it’s more difficult to convey the meaning of what you want to say and go with the flow, and it’s impossible to move forward and progress without self-confidence. I have taken so many influences from different genres, but now the shape and direction of my sets is much more distinct than it was four years ago.

Are there specific DJs that have helped you grow in this way or that inspire you?

I have been a loyal visitor to Bassiani since it was opened where I have listened to countless DJ sets. But among those that made an impression on me, I would single out Florian Kupfer, whose dynamic set I still remember vividly, and other artists like Wata Igarashi, Voiski, Blawan, and The Gods Planet.Besides those, I have many other favourite artists, whose sets I always listen to with admiration and excitement. On 1st January, a Giegling night was held, and as you know, they were playing on the Bassiani stage during the nightclub raid on the 11th of May. That particular set will stick in my memory and has a special importance for me. And I’ll never forget Cadency [also known as Hector Oaks, a Bassiani and Herrensauna resident]’s extremely energetic and long sets performed on the Horoom stage [a room at Bassiani which is more house music-focused] which impacted me greatly. His selections are pretty varied and he merges them all together very harmoniously.

Among local DJs I would single out Zitto, who made a great contribution to the introduction and establishment of the techno sound with his diverse taste and professional attitude to this field. He is interesting and communicates something new to us each time he plays. Also HVL, who has a sophisticated taste and extremely interesting productions.All of these Bassiani artists, and yourself included, have helped transform the club into the world-renowned techno institution that it is today – can you describe how the Georgian scene has evolved in recent years?Bassiani has had a huge impact on the development of the electronic music in Georgia. Today we have an opportunity to listen to the international artists who influenced the wider global electronic scene, and this has been very important in contributing to the shaping and growth of local artists. And, thanks to this, many Georgian artists are now internationally known.

Georgian people walk a really difficult path because of the economic, social and cultural conditions that they are faced with. Because of that, it’s important for them to have spaces where they have an opportunity to express themselves. They feel they are part of something more important than just visiting a club for entertainment.

How did the threat of shutdown at Bassiani last year affect you and your work?

I remember I was working in the studio on that day getting ready for the next day’s event when my friend called me to tell me what was happening. I couldn’t believe it. I went there immediately and joined the people gathered in front of the club as the raid was going on. I was prepared for events to develop in any direction. There was chaos and confrontation. But then the next day, a large group of people united to defend their own rights.The Bassiani raid was extremely terrifying. But the different generations learned how to stand together and stand up for their rights. Standing and fighting together made the government realise that the culture we are creating is not so vulnerable and easily destructible, even in the face of confrontation. Nobody accepted the raid and the closure of the club failed.

You mentioned that Bassiani gives Georgians an opportunity to express themselves, and it has become an important LGBTQ+ venue within Tbilisi. But as a post-Soviet country, Georgia is still deeply conservative in many ways. Do you face any challenges working as a female DJ in a male-dominated field in Georgia?

I would say that the dominance of the men in this field is only felt because of the sheer number of men, or lack of women. As for professional aspect, I haven’t felt any difference. Society and my colleagues accept and respect both men and women on an equal footing.If you look at the world 10 years ago, less women DJs worked in the field than do today. This process is gradually developing on its own. However, in Europe there are a lot more clubs, clubbing culture has a longer history, and there are more opportunities to play. Central Asian artists need to be given more attention.Within central Asia and other parts of Georgia, are there any clubs or cities that you particularly enjoy playing in and why?Elsewhere in Georgia, I would single out two of Kutaisi clubs: Reflector and BUDE. Playing for Kutaisi people is always exceptional for me. In Kutaisi, there are amazingly talented people and this city plays a great role in the development of the Georgian electronic music.Bassiani has been a driving force for clubbing and electronic music in neighbouring countries. Elsewhere in Central Asia at the moment, I would single out the club iN in Baku, Azerbaijan. In Yerevan, Armenia there is also an emerging clubbing scene.Miriam Malek is a freelance writer, follow her on TwitterRead this next!We went to Georgia to investigate the threat to the country's club scene

"His debut album on Planet Mu aims to ""make people’s bodies move in unpredictable ways""Rian Treanor‘s music twists the explorative complexity of software-driven sounds with artistic flair and an unapologetic appreciation for underground soundsystem culture.The son of installation artist and musician Mark Fell, Treanor’s work offers up a similar listener experience to the work shared by his dad. Rich in references and playful hues, releases such as his debut The Death of Rave white-label ‘A Rational Tangle’ nod to both his visual art background and his Northern upbringing, demonstrating his club-driven approach to computer music in soundbite snippets. Treanor shared two more projects on The Death of Rave (‘Pattern Damage’, ‘RAVEDIT’) as well as an EP on Warp sub-label Arcola (‘Contraposition’).Away from music, the Yorkshire-born producer previously flexed his artistic prowess working with the likes of Enjoy Art Space in Leeds as a curator. He also hit up Berlin’s Dubplates & Mastering to study alongside Andreas ‘Lupo’ Lubich. It was ‘Lupo’, says Treanor, who taught him the “importance of reduction”.Throughout his career he’s travelled globally for live performances, installations, DJ sets, residencies and more. In fact, Sheffield’s Hope Works recently locked in Treanor as a 2019 resident. Elsewhere in 2019, Treanor signed to Planet Mu to release his debut album ‘ATAXIA’. The intrepid full-length has been described as “more focused and stricter, in terms of the track selection and the rhythmic structures” in comparison to Treanor’s earlier EPs. It sees Treanor offering up a conceptual record that keeps an electric current of excitement running through its core – an LP that will delight everyone from front left ravers to armchair appreciators.Ahead of its release, he is sharing a new Impact mix featuring tracks from the likes of M.E.S.H., DJ Rashad, Errorsmith and more. Check out his mix, and his Q&A, below.How important was growing up around Sheffield in terms of developing your style and your ear as a producer?It was definitely important. When I was younger, a lot of my friends were really into music. We all had quite weird taste, but a lot of kids were into metal. I was never in bands or stuff, but when I started going to more free parties and things like that I got into electronic music, and luckily there were some quite crazy parties going on around here at that time. There were still parties in warehouses in the Peak District and things like that so those were my first real concerts in a way.For our readers who aren’t aware your dad is Mark Fell. When did you find out more about the work he was doing with music and art and technology?I knew he made music, but it was probably after I were going to these parties, when I started collecting records and learning how to mix. I was getting into more techno, ravey stuff and thinking, ‘Oh this is related to what my dad's doing’. I started researching it a bit more, listening to all his records and stealing all his records. He’s got loads of music, weirder music, and I wouldn’t have come across it otherwise.Clearly when you were younger you were influenced by what you listened to if you were stealing his records. Do you think as an artist yourself now that influence is still there?Yeah for sure, he's had a big influence and it comes across in what I do. I think the things we make are an extension of our influences and my music's a reflection of that context I guess. It’s a part of what I do.You have quite a multidisciplinary arts background. Are you keen to keep your different interests separate or do they all work together?They're not necessarily together, it usually ends up being that I'm more focused on some visual art for one point in time and then it ends up being music. But recently, I've been focusing more on just music and collaborating. I've not done anything that I would say really ties the two together. I grew up just doing art and making things. Like I was saying earlier, all my friends were in bands and I was just always doing visual art. It wasn’t really until I was a bit older that I got into music and then thought, ‘Oh actually this is something I'm interested in and something I could learn about’. I always felt like I was catching up because I didn't learn how to play bass guitar or something! I'd like to do something in future where it's maybe more linked, I have done the artwork for my releases, but right now it’s kind of separate other than that.Can you tell me a little bit about your process when it comes to making music and some of the influences that you tap into when you're starting to write a track?I'm into making software and interfaces, weird rhythm sequences or pattern generators, and building things from that level up. I usually get more ideas from that method, but I also do it completely opposite sometimes, just bashing keys and trying to make a beat that way. Both ways can be rewarding.Did you teach yourself how to make them or is that something that you had to go somewhere else to learn?I'd make music using some kind of normal software like Logic that anyone would really at first. Then some drum machine and things like that but it's always quite a solo…it's hard to work collaboratively when you've only got one mouse pad! I make music on my own for DJing or whatever but then I started messing about making music with people and I actually needed to do something a bit more improvisational.I knew my dad used the software Max/MSP to do a lot of his work and installations. A lot of the music I like was made on that too, but I thought, ‘God, I'm never going to learn how to do that’. It's just totally beyond me. I started messing about a bit with it for a few years, just learning about it, and got better. Obviously, I've asked my dad for a lot of advice, but it's possible to do it by just using online references as well. There are loads of built-in help files and all that kind of stuff, it's accessible. Just having the time, that's the main thing.Moving onto the album, how did that all come together?I didn't really expect to make an LP or anything to be honest. I was just making tracks, just collecting stuff that I'm making and sending them people and they were saying, ‘You should work on an LP with this’. I sent Planet Mu a bunch of things that I'd made, they said they were interested in it and then I sent them some more. It was good to work with them on it, I respected their advice and opinion, so they had a part to play in that definitely. I've grown up listening to Planet Mu.I also read that you were eager to explore the concept of opposites on the album, can you kind of tell me what that means?I guess I always think like that anyway. There are lots of contradictions that exist, but in this LP, I was exploring the physicality of opposing forces and dynamics. Something that has this intense energy, but also some kind of subtlety to it or fragile points. Having this really syncopated structure to something but then thinking, ‘How do you fluidly transform that or modulate it?’ Another thing is, how do you make something that's constant but always changes? In music, you want something to have this consistency but when it's boring, how do you make it move without detouring…I just also think that's how my brain works, in opposition.Where do you think electronic music is going to go in the years to come?Maybe for music in general, I enjoy listening to stuff on high quality soundsystems with dynamics so hopefully the production levels will go up. Another thing would be the social aspect of it, I think this shared experience where you all can build communities is an important thing that is constantly changing.Do you think coding will become more commonplace?Yeah, it definitely is. Obviously being in Sheffield as well, there's a big group of people here like Alex McLean who developed TidalCycles and runs Algorave, it seems like there’s a really good community of people invested in it. I guess it's going to develop more in terms of more people getting into it. The good thing about it is the accessibility, they make it an open platform and an open source thing. That's really what I'm interested in doing, instead of buying a synthesiser or something like that, I look up and research equipment and then think, ‘How can I implement that sort of interface or that methodology into my own work’. With open source platforms and communities becoming more widespread, that adaption and sharing of tools is really going to be exciting.Jasmine Kent-Smith is Mixmag's Staff Writer.

"Florida’s Floret Loret has just debuted a powerful five-track EP of experimental, powerful and diverse songs – an organic collection of various emotions, which come together in the form of Tangled Roots. The impressive producer showcases his raw and melancholic sound throughout the record, which is one of the most cohesive pieces of work I have heard in a while.“Amaryllis” opens Floret Loret’s story with an inviting production filled with panned percussion, soft melodies and an inviting atmosphere. “Juniper” quickly takes a darker turn with haunting themes and echoing vocals that sit beautifully atop distorted basses and pounding drums. My personal favorite, “Cantuta,” acts as a beautiful juxtaposition of light and dark, making it the perfect transitional track. Next, we’re gifted with “Puya Raimondii,” which Floret Loret has been writing continuously for over three years, and it shows. “Árbol” closes the masterpiece out with dizzy sun-drenched themes packed with shimmering harmonies and emotive vibrations.“’Tangled Roots’ is a representation of what goes on in my mind. I produce music as a coping mechanism. I tend to overthink a lot and I sometimes get lost in my own head. These threads of thought become intertwined with my expression of music. Music helps me untie those knots.” – Floret LoretIt’s no wonder why the up-and-coming artist has received support from names like Zeds Dead, Ekali and Alison Wonderland.

"Belgium’s Charlotte de Witte is finally coming back to New York City.It has been over a year-long wait, but the techno superstar will be in Brooklyn’s Avant Gardner on April 13, 2019. Few have been able to reach the heights of Charlotte in such a seemingly short time. In 2018 alone, she has released EPs on Coyu’s Suara and Adam Beyer’s Drumcode. On top of that, she played a mix on Pete Tong’s legendary Essential Mix radio hour and has been named a BBC Radio 1 Resident. Her style is dark, fast, hard-hitting techno that can blast any club or festival to smithereens. Speaking of festivals, the 26-year-old has played Tomorrowland as well as both Ultra Europe and Ultra in Miami later this month.Joining Charlotte de Witte that evening will include Germany’s Monoloc and the NYC debut of Brazil’s Victor Ruiz. The Avant Gardner is no stranger to dark, bass-driven techno, so when you combine the space with the sounds, this will be a night to remember. Tickets are on sale now. The AuthorYou Might Also Like

"Ultra Music Festival Miami is gearing up for their 21st year in production with an incredibly stacked lineup and a plan for the biggest event the festival has seen yet. The festival recently announced their move from Bayfront Park to Virginia Key, and with this transition they have had the ability to add many new and exciting features to their already world renowned event.A few of these additions are Resistance Island, a new home for the trance and techno artists to bring the house down throughout the entire festival, a free boat service complete with bars and elevated viewing decks for VIP Ultranauts, and a multitude of transit options including ferries and shuttles for all festivalgoers. Ultra has also launched a campaign for maintaining full environmental protection of Virginia Key with their move, called Mission: Home. They are taking extra strides to provide protection to Earth and its wildlife for generations to come.The final lineup has been presented as well, and it is nothing short of amazing. With main stage headliners like Carl Cox, Dog Blood, Armin Van Buuren, Tiesto, Zeds Dead, and The Chainsmokers, and a support filled with the top artists of the electronic industry, this year is sure to be the best yet.Only a limited amount of tickets remain and are sure to sell out, so get yours here and secure your spot for Ultra Music Festival 2019.You Might Also Like

"With Ultra Music Festival this weekend, we thought the least we could do was set you up with our top 10 acts you must see. This week seemed like it would never come with the new venue drama. Yet, the show must go on and Ultra’s new home is already looking better than ever. Start planning your schedule and stocking up on earplugs. This duo comprises Boys Noize and Skrillex. Is there anything else that really needs to be added? Dog Blood came to fruition in 2012 with the release of their Middle Finger EP. Last year, Dog Blood announced another tour and hasn’t played Ultra since 2013. Expect anything and everything: house, techno, dubstep, hip-hop, and loads of craziness as this dynamic duo destroys Ultra Worldwide. Ultra Worldwide, Friday, 11:15 p.m.There isn’t another DJ who can handle Ultra’s sound system like Carl Cox. His stadium techno sound and perpetual source of untapped energy make him a mandatory must-see. Ultra’s newest techno creation, Resistance, caters to the underground scene with an utterly stacked lineup. Better yet, Ultra will be giving its techno die-hards their very own island with the best techno and house DJs. The Carl Cox Megastructure, one of Resistance’s stages, will be there the entire weekend. This is a long way from its usual two-day slot. While Carl will be playing all three days, he will be joined by Italy’s Marco Carola on Saturday. Between the often Balearic bass of Carl combined with the flawless transition of Marco, this will be Ibiza meets Miami. Carl Cox Mega Structure, Saturday, 12:00 a.m.Nora En Pure left us breathless during her set last year. The delicate and groovy mixture of deep house and indie kept the crowd in a hypnotic daze during the afternoon set. Ultra seemed to have listened as well and decided to give her an afternoon slot on Friday. The deep grooves of Nora, combined with the still waters that will surround the festival, will be a perfect way to start off the weekend madness. Main Stage, Friday 4 p.m.Get ready to go down a wormhole. The psychedelic quartet will be taking the decks of A State of Trance on Sunday. Expect high BPM, lifting melodies, and an acid rainstorm of psy-trance. Infected Mushroom has not grown to fame for their subtlety. Perhaps the more euphoric breaks of Vini Vici will help even out the crowd from going into a completely trance frenzy.A State of Trance, Sunday, 8:30 p.m.Very few things can challenge deadmau5. His creative ability to produce and perform is something not many DJs could ever fathom. If you are into electronic music, seeing deadmau5 almost becomes a prerequisite before you can call yourself a fan of electronic music. This year, deadmau5 will be debuting his Cube 3.0 stage structure — a DJ deck littered with LED panels. Details on that have remained fairly hidden; Ultra sure does love secrets. Experience a legend with new stage design in a new location. Not a fan of Deadmau5? Well how about you see his techno alias, Testpilot on Sunday? Who doesn’t love change? Live Arena, Saturday, 12:30 a.m. / Resistance Reflektor, Sunday 12:00 a.m.  Ultra’s favorite trio is back with another installment of no holds barred techno. PLAYdifferently will be hosting the Reflektor stage that day and will bring hours of deep and minimal techno via acts like Dubfire, Nicole Moudaber, and Paco Osuna. Last year’s set brought literal ground-shaking bass to Miami as the trio transitioned endlessly under the Miami sun. Three legends, three MODEL 1 mixers, endless possibilities. Saturday, Reflektor, 12 a.m.It’s only fair that we include some Miami talent into the mix. Afrobeta has been playing Ultra for years and has been a hometown favorite. Cuci Amador and Tony Smurphio make up the duo. They always leave attendees with an unforgettable blend of electronic and indie sounds with experienced yet refreshing showmanship. Let Afrobeta officially greet you when those longly awaited gates finally open. Live Arena, Friday, 2 p.m.Calm down. We all know Tom Morello, guitarist for Rage Against the Machine and Audioslave, doesn’t  scream electronic music. However, his roots are more electronic and hip-hop orientated than one might expect. Tom Morello has stretched the paradigm of how a guitar should should since we were in diapers. His manipulated guitar effects are influenced by early West Coast hip-hop DJ’s which brought his bands to unfounded heights. Plus, are we just going to forget he preformed with Knife Party during Ultra 2016? On top of that, He is a Harvard educated political activist and has years of touring in his resume. Why wouldn’t you check out a mastermind shred during Ultra?Live Arena, Friday, 7 p.m.Oliver Heldens has a keen ability to quickly and effortlessly transition from genre to genre. He brings the crowd through a rollercoaster where you enjoy every second and feel almost lightweight through tales of EDM and house. Oliver was one of the earlier slots last year, so let’s see what he brings to help close it out this year. Main Stage, Sunday, 7:35 p.m.Maceo is never one to disappoint. His melodic tracks keep you light on your feet while his more acid-centric sounds have you going into a dancing frenzy. Although considering he is playing after Carl Cox and before Adam Beyer, you should prepare for the latter — hard-hitting bass that his eloquently entangled with claps and snares from his weapon of choice: the Pioneer RMX-1000 Remix Station. Carl Cox Megastructure, Sunday, 10:00 p.m.Find more information at Ultramusicfestival.com.Update: Eric Prydz has cancelled all Miami shows.You Might Also Like

"BUKU Music + Art Project returned for its 7th year at Mardi Gras World in New Orleans, Louisiana this past weekend.The event has seen many changes from years past but the new developments proved successful for the festival. The Wharf stage had major revisions from last year including a larger stage and more accessible VIP areas with larger bars, and the festival added a new stage layout for the legendary Float Den. The Power Plant main stage area was equipped with more seating for guests including shaded areas and hammocks. The art installations near the main stage were immensely impressive, as each installation progressed during the weekend to form a beautiful work of art.ALIVEThe lineup for this year’s BUKU was stacked as usual, with its variety and genre-bending composition. Headliners Lana Del Rey, RL Grime, and Dog Blood were the biggest talk of the weekend, absolutely blowing the minds of all attendees.

"Take the opportunity to check out the Unorthodox EP from Skantia if you get the chance – we can assure you it’s worth it. The UK-based drum and bass DJ/producer put together the short collection for Program, and it features three seriously strong cuts. We chatted it through with him to find out more.To kick things off, can you tell us a little about yourself for those who don’t already know… who are you and where are you currently based?Hi, I’m Charlie, aka Skantia, 22 years old and was born and live in Newcastle Upon-Tyne.How long have you been making music for?I’ve been making music for near enough 3 years now.What/who/where inspires you the most creatively?Major inspirations have to be NOISIA, Culture Shock, Monty, Signal, there are too many to name. All my friends and living in Newcastle have had an impact on what I make as well, in a good way.What are your favourite parts about being an artist? If you could change one thing about it, what would it be?It’s satisfying being able to create a piece of music to your own taste. I don’t know what I could change about it, probably delete writer’s block from the face of the earth.Your new EP Unorthodox is making waves on Program! How long ago did you start working on it?“Unorthodox” & “Slapstik” came together quite quickly. It took around 3-4 days to complete each one with the arrangement, then the mixdown and mastering took a week or two. “Run” took around 2 months to fully complete. It became a bit of a pain but all in all, I had lots of fun making the EP.Out of the three tracks, do you have a particular favourite?I’d probably say “Unorthodox,” the mixdown on the drums plays a factor. The finished result of “Run” and “Slapstik” wasn’t quite what I hoped in terms of quality, but that’s what VIPs are for.Which took the longest to make from start to finish?Definitely “Run.” Jeez, that tune became energy-draining.If you could collaborate with any artist on earth, whom would you choose and why?I’d have to say Monty or Current Value because their sound is next to none.What sets you apart with your sound?I just want to keep going in the direction of making tunes.Which direction do you want to take over the next year? Any plans you can share with us?Not plans I can share out, but I have things in the works.Connect with Skantia: Facebook / Twitter / SoundCloudYou Might Also Like

"Keith Flint, lead vocalist for The Prodigy, was found dead earlier today at age 49. Flint, who always sported a Mohawk along with a dynamic demeanor, helped produce albums like Fat of the Land and tracks like “Breathe.” His contributions made the English group a global electronic juggernaut for decades.  Flint was well aware of his untapped reserve of energy and stated in an interview with The Guardian back in 2009, “It gets my mental energy out. That’s why I’m really honest on stage. I’m not there for the beauty of my voice or to be the best dancer. I go out to express myself and stir up the audience.”Liam Howlett, founding member of The Prodigy, took to Instagram earlier this morning to tell about the tragic news: “The news is true, I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend, I’m shell shocked, fuckin angry , confused and heart broken ….. r.i.p brother Liam.” The news is true , I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend ,  I’m shell shocked , fuckin angry , confused and heart broken ….. r.i.p brother Liam #theprodigyA post shared by  The Prodigy official (@theprodigyofficial) on Mar 4, 2019 at 4:13am PSTThe Prodigy was set to play a show in New York at Terminal 5 in May.

"These days, it seems like everyone and their mother is announcing their own music festival. From Excision’s Lost Lands to Bassnectar’s Deja Voom and more, artists everywhere are showing their knack for curating the best and biggest live music events they can. Last week, Porter Robinson announced his latest endeavor, Second Sky Music Festival, set to take place Saturday, June 15 at Middle Harbor Shoreline Park in Oakland, California.Porter Robinson is known for changing the game when it comes to electronic music. With his 2014 release of the highly-acclaimed Worlds album, he helped ignite a shift in the direction of the genre, and his recent project as Virtual Self brought DDR and early 2000s electro to the forefront of modern electronic music. With all of this praise and notoriety behind his name, Porter certainly has a lot of high expectations for this festival, and I expect him to live up to every single one of them.The festival, specially curated by Mr. Robinson himself, represents some his own favorite artists and already is proving to be what one might expect from the 26-year-old producer. The first headliners announced are eclectic electro-synth pop bands Kero Kero Bonito and Anamanaguchi, two artists who have been pushing boundaries with their wonderfully weird and colorful sounds. Porter has already proven himself to be ahead of the game when it comes to what’s next in electronic music, and I for one cannot wait to see who else he will choose to headline this festival. Nina Las Vegas, Cashmere Cat and G Jones are just a few of the other artists confirmed for the inaugural festival. Tickets for Second Sky Music Festival go on sale March 15th, with pre-sale sign-ups already available here.

"New label L&T Recordings is run by Thom Carruthers. L&T has a lot to give to the electronic scene, I listened to a number of tracks from Probe 1 by LeWmk to the single Phase O matic by  Jules van Daniken, and one noticeable and clever production style it has is the use of a very tight and high end percussion sequencing techniques that get used for the tunes on this label. It’s almost like rain dropping into a pool of retro sweeps and the droplets acting as a blanket covering them. I love this, among other artists and contributors with Thom are AKA phantom and LJM and TOMO. They also join the team with glitch percussion and 90’s acid sounds, which is great to hear that producers still enjoy this style of production and that the use of retro hardware and software is staying strong.The use of Atari-like sounds on this label’s releases are well placed, drawing you into a thought provoking flight through space. Accompanying that, you also get tones of dark minimal house elements that grab you when you least expect it, keeping you pinned to the wall. Thom keeps a tight ship running here with music which really goes together from all artists with a seamless fluid flow, and it’s a label to look out for.L&T Recordings built a great list of artists and producers, and if your style is genre mash-up with 90’s acid to new glitch feels, then get board. A night with L&T would be n electro experimental madness session. Click below hear why.LOADING………, Production name Beyond the Clones, a producer from south devon living in Frankfurt, consisting of progressive dark electro and Minimal house well I call it zombie house Music, using some crazy tactics to get there, computer coded madness, sampling old school consoles, I have a new EP out soon ‘Electric Jelly Zombie EP’ out on bitTorrent and a special edition version on Google apps, oh and my cat controls me.",articles25,['Beyond the Clones']

His success has seen him perform for global club brands including Ministry of Sound, Cream and The Warehouse Project.Lempo underwent an emergency operation in 2018 to correct a heart condition that could have otherwise killed him within six months. A key feature on the original mix of ‘No More‘ is Lempo‘s use of samples.

"Bucharest based Freqax is no stranger to the chaotic world of drum & bass; his music certainly reflects that fact and his ‘Warbling’ EP on Pulsatil Records is a return to form. With the help of Brusten, Freqax delivers ‘We’re On’ and ‘Warble’, two tracks which highlight his expertise.Record label Pulsatil has identified itself as a key player in the changing direction of the drum & bass underground. Their forthcoming release is no different. Founded this year, it’s only in its infancy yet they’ve had Freqax driving the charge and are defining themselves within the contemporary market.The first track on the double-sided single is our premiere ‘We’re On’. It doesn’t follow the generic dark drum & bass guidelines, instead, it reaches a more open soundscape that ticks into play with every percussive slab. ‘We’re On’ features slamming drum layers which highlight the track’s dancefloor vibes and despite it having a highly-complex technicality, it’s still given a bass-heavy kick amongst every switching relay of beats.The flipside is the collaboration between Freqax and Brusten ‘Warble’. The main element which catches the listener’s attention is its jumping bassline, one which dips in and out of each sixteen bars.Check out ‘We’re On’ below.

"Our lovely friend, Bradley Gunn last night called time on his ‘raving days’ in a statement across all his social media.   For all those don’t know Bradley, he lives with Asperger’s Syndrome and often found himself struggling in social environments and dealing with feelings of self-consciousness. He found a solution to going raving and dancing – read our full first interview with him here.Today, he’s ended his raving days and all of us at Data Transmission wish him a whole hearted best wishes in his next ventures, big love Brad!Here’s the full statement: After a while of taking some time out to mentally process everything and have some self-reflection, I have decided to bring my time as Bradley Gunn Raver to an end.“All conditioned things are impermanent”The above quote comes from Buddhist philosophy, simply put it means that nothing lasts forever. Things are constantly arising and passing away, turning into other things. Therefore, it is no good clinging to them, as that only causes suffering.My time as Bradley Gunn Raver has come to an end. I shall be continuing onto the next adventure as Bradley Gunn.What started out as a simple love for raving, has become far greater and more powerful than I had ever imagined, to the point it is now controlling my life. I never expected to be where I am now, delivering content globally via social media, meeting the people I meet, getting involved in the business ventures I find myself in. To have even one person say I have inspired them, whether it be one way for one person or in another way to another person, the feeling of what I have achieved is incredible. Not only that but I have also learnt how to overcome a lot of my fears and know myself a lot better. I am incredibly thankful to the world.There is a dark side however, to everything I become obsessed with, and that is just the nature with having Asperger’s. Over time, an obsession grows, it becomes more demanding and serious, to the point I prioritise the interest above all other parts of life. At first, I was happy just going a long to dance at events, the core reason why I started, and the core reason has stuck ever since, but it’s more than that now. I no longer feel satisfied just dancing, the core interest has diluted that it doesn’t have as much influence as it did. I have lost the love for the very thing I loved. This has been caused by a number of factors such as becoming too serious about it all, a number of bad experiences in the business side of things and the way things have developed over time to the point where it is no longer as it was originally defined.I feel trapped inside what I have created. I constantly feel stressed, having to live inside my self-manufactured, conditioned public image. It’s quite ironic as the message I was pushing out was to be free, be yourself, not care what people think and just lose yourself on the dancefloor, yet as the days went by, I was becoming more disconnected from this ethos more and more, the organic, free-living image had become a very strict, controlled and staged image.. The amazing thing I created, the obsession… has become my own prison. I did not want to continue to publish content going to events and telling everyone I’m having a great time when I’m not, pushing out an image which I know I am no longer naturally living, I felt that lying to not only my followers but also myself.I have therefore taken the conscious decision, to end Bradley Gunn Raver. I will be moving onto the next chapter of my life now. This decision hasn’t been concluded lightly, this has been thoroughly thought out over time and discussed with highly trusted close friends.I will not be deleting my social media, therefore if you wish you can follow the next adventure, it would be lovely to have you.

Dave Clark, the man behind Digital and Vinyl Expert, to explore the differences
and upgrades from the Traktor Kontrol S4 MK2 to the S4 MK3.Native Instruments’ Traktor Kontrol S4 MK3 was designed to let you
connect with your tracks in new ways. It features new motorized jog wheels
which provide you with haptic feedback (the ability for the controller to
communicate back to you via touch for those who aren’t familiar) so you’ll be
able to nudge, stop and spin them just like vinyl. Two hi-res displays
have been added to help you keep an eye on the mix during your sets as well as
a variety of new features which you can check out in the video. If you’d like a

of courses suited to every skill level. Check out their DJ

controller. These include its new combi mic XLR jack, two headphone inputs
(jack and 1/4 inch jack), additional powered USB port for your music and
more as well as the ability to use the controller as an external mixer for
turntables or CDJs. Focussing on the jog wheels, the MK3 features a much
bigger and flatter CDJ mechanism which, as mentioned previously, is
mind-blowingly motorized with haptic drive so you can really feel the beats
during your mix. The pair play around with the controller’s flux and
reverse modes before taking a look at the new hi-res screens which

"I don’t pretend to be the world’s foremost leading expert on techno. Truth be told it’s rather a scary genre, full of people who like a pure kind of techno, or a minimal kind of techno, or a kind of techno made in a certain place.All I know is techno is good when it’s got the funk. Riva Starr‘s techno spinoff Hyperloop already has a great pedigree with releases on Adam Beyer‘s Truesoul and Drumcode. Now it brings an undeniable heavy dose of machine funk to Josh Wink‘s Ovum.There are three tracks on the EP, the first ‘Alone With The Gods’ is a simple, heavyweight techno jam. It’s not easy to make something with this much feeling with so few elements. Huge kick drum, repetitive stab, high string, sharp high hats. It’s all about the arrangement, the highs and lows to ebb and flow the energy. When the breakdown kicks in and the spoken words, taken from a Charles Bukowski poem drop into the mix it makes beautiful sense. This is music that you’d watch aliens come from outer space to take over the world. It just sounds that way. A powerhouse groove.Reknik is techno with a housier, filtered loop, straight-up, in-your-face sound. From the start it sets out with incredible energy and a blistering bass-led groove. The sample is, if I’m not mistaken, from the Masters at Work remix of Mondo Grosso‘s – ‘Souffles H’, a stone cold house classic from back in the day. This kind of track is a head down, hands up, work the floor, no-nonsense floor destroyer. Programme this right in your set and watch the reaction.‘Hyperspace’ is a variation on a theme, with big stabs punctuated throughout. It’s another big groove, peppered with old-skool samples and kept simple with that big drum groove. A strong track, but lacking in the soul that drives ‘Alone With The Gods’ and ‘Reknik’.I am possibly not your best judge of what techno is cool. I can, however, say with some authority that this is techno with funk, with  groove and with soul. And that is cool.A big release.Score: 8.5/10Buy from Beatport here:",articles34,"['All I know', 'Hyperloop', 'Charles Bukowski', 'I’m', 'Programme']"

"When a record label is able to curate sounds that transcend genres, you find music that transcends the typical club fare, music that the listener brings into their everyday repertoire. Hallucienda has been able to do just that calling upon an eclectic roster of producers and DJ’s who think beyond the traditional algorithms of dance music and produce a spectrum of sounds provoking its audience to consider music outside of their usual realm of listening.
Their releases reflect the tastes of its founder, Christopher Milo aka DJ Three, a figure revered within the dance music community for his genre-bending selection of worldly and otherworldly music that has captivated crowds from the grittiest nightclubs to deep within the Earth’s most unique locations. Through Hallucienda’s impressive catalog and coveted lineups that have traveled through a range of notable destinations; they’ve established themselves as a respected mainstay that continually aims to blur the line between organic and synthetic sounds.
The story of how Hallucienda came to be as a record label is a tale of continuity since the start of American rave culture.  DJ Three had played an integral role in the early 90’s bringing names like Doc Martin and Moby to Florida to the first one-off raves parties in the southeastern US.  Having played a key role with Rabbit In The Moon’s Hallucination Recordings since 1992 the following decade saw the need for DJ Three to focus on curating artists and productions he was discovering for his own sister label Hallucination Limited.  The label continued their streak of timeless music which, by 2011, Cassy had featured no less than five tracks from the label on her Mixmag cover CD ‘The Sound Circo Loco At DC10’.  Also, during this time he began producing a string of tracks as Montage Men, Three A.M. and Second Hand Satellites which continue to be played weekly by selectors the world over.  Like Hallucination Recordings before it, after a successful ten-year run DJ Three decided it was once again time to reimagine the imprint.  In 2014, he sought to continue on his own whilst still threading the needle through its two previous incarnations.  With conceptual compilation series  like Phono Obscura  (rare & unreleased tracks), Wow & Flutter (ambient & electronica) Colorfast (select cuts from the previous vinyl-only catalogs of Hallucination & Hallucination Limited) and a heavy focus on artists albums and EP’s like Oona Dahl’s ‘Holograma’ and Chris Mitchell’s ‘Living In Now Living In Next’, Hallucienda is forging ahead into a third era of timeless electronic music.

Hallucienda has been able to garner international attention not only as a record label but also as a notorious gathering of some of the industry’s most respected players. The first party over a decade ago was held during what was then famed Winter Music Conference destination The Marlin Hotel. Since then the party has seen lineups that include underground favorites such as James Holden, Seth Troxler, Cassy, Daniel Bell, DJ Tennis, as well as Damian Lazarus first-ever US gig and, of course, DJ Three himself. These parties have been characterized by its attendees who are devoted connoisseurs of underground sounds and, the music itself, which knows no boundaries and seeks not only to make the listener dance but to make them think outside the box.
This Thursday, March 28th Hallucienda returns as ambitious as ever to Wynwood’s crown jewel The Electric Pickle to celebrate their 10th and final Miami Music Week soiree together before the storied venue closes its door forever this June.  The lineup summons some of DJ Three’s favorite co-conspirators: Oona Dahl, DJ Tennis, and Doc Martin (who has remained a close friend ever since Three brought him to Florida that first time back in 1992).  The party is known for a dance floor full of his peers so you can be sure this party will be on the radar of many DJ’s looking to dance during Miami Music Week.  Tickets are still available here!

"Point Blank are back with Ski Oakenfull for an extra special deconstruction of Adamski’s huge 90s hit, ‘Killer’, featuring soul-sensation, Seal. This PB deconstruction is particularly special as they were joined by Adamski himself to answer some questions about his processes, how he hooked up with Seal for the track and his career before delving into the magic behind his anthemic ‘Killer’. In case you don’t know, Ski is the Head of Curriculum at Point Blank so whether you study with  them in London or Online (or elsewhere) he will have a major hand in what you learn at the school.
The Adamski-produced ‘Killer’ was released back in 1990 and fuses influences from acid house and soul with plenty of dancey vibes mixed in. What started off as an instrumental to be included in the UK-producer, DJ and singer’s live sets soon became a legendary earworm that’s racked up millions of plays to date. The track was created using the iconic Roland TR-909 as well as the Ensoniq SQ 80 synth and a Yamaha RX120 Drum Machine (some pieces of gear Ski goes into more detail about in the video) and featured on Adamski’s Doctor Adamski’s Musical Pharmacy, which was released by major label, MCA.
For the deconstruction, Ski fires up Ableton Live 10.1 with his trusty Push 2 and loads up Ableton’s stock 909 kit. He punches in the beat starting with kicks, claps, rim shots and hats before breaking for an exclusive interview with the man behind the track. Picking things back up, Ski keys in the iconic bassline revealing a plugin he found which emulates the distinct sound perfectly. He plays in the emotional chords for ‘Killer’ shedding some light on the music theory behind the track then gets to work on the rave piano and bell synth which lends that added sparkle. Ski rounds things off by adding the vocals to the song which were recreated by Valerie Etienne and recorded in Point Blank’s studio 5.

LCPR presents ‘We Dance: Venezuela’ in support of the local non-profit organization ‘Venezolanos Por La Vida – Canada’ on March 20 at Love Child Social House. It will be a night of music curated by influential DJs, food from the local restaurant Gordo EX Cafe, for an authentic Venezuelan flavor and an art gallery presented by local Venezuelan artists.
Venezuelans for Life – Canada is collecting and sending medical supplies to human rights organizations and health service providers to help Venezuelans in the country and those forced to flee their homes; ‘the walkers’. LCPR has brought together the local electronic music community of Toronto to join and support this cause.
The lineup includes the deep melodic house duo Carerra & Tavares to start the event. They are followed by the Toronto-based Brazilian Hauy. Finally, a back-to-back between My Favorite Robot and Nitin, who are recognized representatives of the world electronic music.

Venezuela is currently suffering from the most serious shortage of medicines and medical equipment in its history. Hospitals and clinics can not treat patients and, because of the lack of the most basic medical supplies, people die unnecessarily.
Venezuelans for Life, the Humanitarian Aid Program of the Democracy Forum of Canada and Venezuela, was created with the purpose of providing relief to the great humanitarian crisis faced by Venezuelans today, to give some hope to Venezuelans in the country.

Flint was part of one of the most important electronic bands in the world scene, with hits like “Firestarter” and “Breathe”, both boosting the group’s worldwide success.
One of the band members, Liam Howlett wrote on Instagram that Flint had died by suicide.
“The news is true, I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend,” Howlett wrote on the group’s Instagram account. “I’m shell shocked, f****n angry, confused and heart broken,” he added.
Local police had earlier confirmed that the artist was found dead at his house in Essex on Monday morning.
In ’97, The Prodigy became the first electronic group to headline Glastonbury Festival. They were set to play the festival again this year.

Flint began as street-dancer of The Prodigy, but his strident voice, his movements on stage and his striking look made him their main vocalist. His qualities also catapulted him as one of the most recognized artists of the British music scene of the nineties.

"In Point Blank’s latest studio tech overview, they were joined by Dave Clark, the man behind Digital and Vinyl Expert, to explore the differences and upgrades from the Traktor Kontrol S4 MK2 to the S4 MK3.
Native Instruments’ Traktor Kontrol S4 MK3 was designed to let you connect with your tracks in new ways. It features new motorized jog wheels which provide you with haptic feedback (the ability for the controller to communicate back to you via touch for those who aren’t familiar) so you’ll be able to nudge, stop and spin them just like vinyl. Two hi-res displays have been added to help you keep an eye on the mix during your sets as well as a variety of new features which you can check out in the video. If you’d like a more hands-on experience in learning to DJ, Point Blank offer a variety of courses suited to every skill level. Check out their DJ courses here and watch the Traktor S4 MK3 in action now.

First up Dave and PB’s DJ Ravine look at the inputs and outputs of the new controller. These include its new combi mic XLR jack, two headphone inputs (jack and 1/4 inch jack), additional powered USB port for your music and more as well as the ability to use the controller as an external mixer for turntables or CDJs. Focussing on the jog wheels, the MK3 features a much bigger and flatter CDJ mechanism which, as mentioned previously, is mind-blowingly motorized with haptic drive so you can really feel the beats during your mix. The pair play around with the controller’s flux and reverse modes before taking a look at the new hi-res screens which display track info, BPMs and the song’s key which to the delight of harmonic mixers can now be changed using one of the dials.

"Three tracks to fire up the dancefloor.
This March 1st, Brooklyn record label Dance Artifakts is set to release the ‘Last Days’ EP by Irish DJ and producer Jay Skelly, consisting of the original title cut, plus two remixes from Anthony Georges Patrice and Lost People.
Dance Artifakts is known for publishing records that stretch the boundaries of electronic dance music, beyond the reaches of house and progressive and towards unchartered territories by means of cerebral, creative tracks that bring something very different to the table. Uncommon textures, atmospheres and structures make the music stand out and provide a break from the recurrent themes and sounds of other labels’ run-of-the-mill musical output.
In this respect, Berlin-based Jay Skelly offers his own contribution to the imprint’s discography by way of his original tune ‘Last Days’. A fan of 80’s synth pop, soul and disco since early on, he was influenced as well by early electronic acts such as Kraftwerk and 90’s superstars like Daft Punk and the Chemical Brothers. An extensive DJ’ing and studio schedule has allowed him to further explore the genres he loves, gearing him towards finding his own particular sound.
The ‘Last Days’ EP includes two remixes of Skelly’s original track by France’s Anthony Georges Patrice and Dance Artifakts’ recurring artist Lost People, which promise to round out a compelling record. Grab your copy here.

"The material has been on production for over 7 years.
Spanish DJ and producer Coyu is about to drop his first LP to be out June 17th. Entitled ‘You Don’t Know’ will be released on his label Suara Music.
A career-defining moment for the artist’s career where he will count with electronic music stellar collaborations that include names such as Lazarusman, Mike Leary, The Horrorist., Thomas Gandey and Gabriella Vergilov.
“The album is named ‘You Don’t Know’ because many people have a preconceived idea of who I am. Until now, maybe I wasn’t smart enough to show them who I really am, my roots, what I love and what I can offer to the music.  With this album I want to change that preconception. I want to show a side of me that people have never seen”, Coyu commented.

We all know technical difficulties are the worst, but Cash Cash just couldn’t take the heat anymore.While Cash Cash was playing their set on Ultra’s main stage, the equipment had a mind of its own and started malfunctioning. According to witnesses at the scene, the group’s mixer began to fail due to exposure to pyrotechnics on stage. Once this kept repeatedly happening throughout their set; one of the members took his aggression out on the mixer and threw it off stage toward the crowd.The malfunction happened for approximately 20 minutes while the Ultra staff replaced the mixer.

"No doubt your social media feeds are filled with complaints and videos from last night’s Ultra Music Festival bus fiasco. What was planned as an orderly exit system quickly fell apart due to a number of factors, leaving police to tell attendees to walk the approx 2 miles from the Marine Stadium area to Vizcaya area and try their luck from there.People are throwing around Fyre Fest and TomorrowWorld as comparisons, however it was always expected that a task of this magnitude would encounter difficulty on the first go round. Nevertheless, things looked awfully bad and Ultra offered a mea culpa on Saturday.OFFICIAL STATEMENT:Last night, many of you experienced challenging transportation conditions leaving the festival. This is unacceptable and inconsistent with the high standards you have come to expect from us. For this, we are sorry.Today Ultra had a press conference at 11:30 detailing their plans to fix the system for Saturday. Ultra Security Chief Ray Martinez said the issues arose because many more people left early than expected, snarling the bus plan for a mass exit.On Friday night, the Rickenbacker Causeway did not reserve a lane solely for bus exits until 1am. On Saturday that will begin at 9.30pm. Ultra will also be boosting the number of busses and adding a plan to better direct pedestrians to south side of Rickenbacker where there is a path.In what might seem to some as callous, Martinez remarked that the weather was beautiful and it was not the worst thing in the world to walk the bridge in those conditions. Those who went to TomorrowWorld know that if it was raining, it would be an entirely different and much scarier game.",articles11,"['Vizcaya', 'Rickenbacker']"
"Miami Music Week is drawing to a close and Ultra Music Festival is settling in to its new home at Virginia Key. Sunday is the holy day of A State of Trance so we sat down with Armin van Buuren ahead of all of the madness to see what he thinks about the changes and what he has in store for us.It was a favor for Sirius, they wanted to do a new thing on their chill channel. I am a big fan of their chill channel. I am one of the biggest fans of ambient, down tempo, and chill stuff. Two years ago I released an album called Club Embrace. It is kind of down tempo and less aggressive mixes of my earlier songs. I was doing a big show in Amsterdam and around the world. I wanted to be the only DJ, would be kind of weird if there was a warmup. So I thought what I am going to do when people walk in? I came up with the idea to do a two/three hour mix of my own songs but down tempo. I approached all my friends in the progressive world and they made these amazing cool remixes. It’s on Spotify, been there for two years.I won’t do this for a regular thing because people like me for the trance stuff. But you know its Miami and Sirius so – I am glad you liked it.Thank you guys for all your support. I have been following you stuff as well. It is always important that you guys review something.I am finishing the album as we speak. With the Gaia project I want to be a little bit more rebellious. I am going to go against the grain a little bit. Obviously the Gaia is everything that Armin is not. Don’t expect any big collaborations, vocal tracks. It is just all live. Normally when you produce an album you would go to the studio and create a bunch of tracks, and they you would compile that and say ‘heres my album.’ For this album, we went completely the other side. We have done the live show, the project is finished, but we actually don’t have the album.The way we did that is we have a bunch of loops and melodies and sequences. We have live synths and arranged the album live. I just need to fix a few things. What we first want to do is release the album and then a few months later then release the live Paradiso (ADE) set. It is radically different, the themes are the same but mixed in a different way. Because it is in front of a live crowd, it was so much fun to approach it from that way because it was unorthodox and outside of my comfort zone as a DJ. I am going to take my time, I feel it needs to be perfect, I am in no rush. The good news is the live show is done.So we are ready to go live and it could be anywhere from 15 minutes to 3 hours. It is basically a live jam. We are triggering live sequences, and I am not able to play you a single track. Because it is all loops, I could only play you 4 seconds of loops.Yes, two Ableton sessions. Linked to each other. It was a really good project because it was so far away from Armin van Buuren. I need to finish it soon.Mostly we start with the club version. But it is a different time than 10 years ago, the trance world is even though it is super great is a small tight community. Those are always my fans but I want to reach a greater audience and pull them into the trance world. I am trying to find new trance family members. So the idea is get the pop version and then the club version. And sometimes the club version does even better than the radio version. “Wild Wild Son’ did really well in Belgium and the Netherlands but not so much in other countries. The Club version did really well in the States.Doing the pop version does not guarantee a hit. I just find it exciting but it is just the background you change. It is really hard to make a pop mix of dance track, but it is easy to make a dance track of a pop track.Hopefully, I have a huge amount of respect for the guys. Because we started around the same time, actually my manager helped them set up Anjunabeats and advised them on deals. So we have always had something go on in sync and we at Armada love Anjunabeats. It is so cleaver and clean and I am a fan of their shows.I have always been good friends with the guys. It took a year actually, I flew to their office to see their operations and how they approached things. We didn’t want to share any hint online because of the pressure. If we had released something online about an Above & Beyond collaboration, everyone would have been [going crazy]. And then the pressure would have been on. I was hoping to release it in October of last year because that was the original plan, but it took a lot of time and effort. There was ongoing discussion of what we should and not do. But I think you can hear both of our sounds in the song. I think it was version 100 that was actually the final version.It is literally a 50/50 thing with those guys. I learned so much from those guys.Well I have a new collaboration coming up, state of Trance 2019, coming out in May. I’ll be dropping tracks from there, a lot of new stuff. Also I am going to be playing more of the stuff you expect me to play. It is going to be a very different Ultra this year so it depends on the crowd. We are in a new location, new megastructure and live stage. So it is a different vibe, and I always look at the crowd and then I decide.I have a folder of about 100 tracks and 70 of them are brand new. And 30 are more established tracks. The main stage set is more whoops and hops. A lot of exclusives, it is going to be different from what you expect. Everyone expect me to start out with that track I have been starting out with recently, but as itt is the start of the DJ season you have to bring your “A” game.I am just a little worried that all the fans will get there in one piece. With the transport and I hope the vibe will be like the downtown one. In all honesty, I was really skeptical when they left the other area. I was like “oh my god, that is going to kill the vibe”. I think next year everyone will be happy. It is a strange year, the Swedes are not here, Hardwell is not here but hey I am gonna bring my “A” Game.",articles11,"['Music Week', 'Sunday', 'Armin van Buuren', 'Sirius', 'Thank', 'Armin', 'Yes', 'Mostly', 'Those', 'The Club', 'Everyone']"

If all goes well, we can hope to see the plan become available in more countries. Those who are married or have a close friend with similar music tastes, will want to consider this new plan. It might bond your relationship closer and most importantly, save you some money!Spotify Duo includes all the same features as a regular Premium account but offers one special feature; Duo Mix. If you and a friend have a Duo membership, the Duo Mix will incorporate music from both your styles. For example, if you love listening to EDM and your friend loves listening to Country, the Duo Mix playlist will do it’s best to mix those together. Would definitely make for a unique playlist, one we hope doesn’t split friendships. Lastly, Duo Mix offers three listening modes: standard, chill, and uptempo, perfect for whatever mood you guys are in.In all, Spotify Duo might be the perfect choice for you and a close friend, rather than the Spotify Family Plan. If your significant other does have conflicting music styles, you’ll still be able to have your own curated playlists. They will be shared with your Duo Partner though. It’s reported to cost around $12.49 a month, if officially initiated in the USA.

"If you’re working to earn a Grammy next year, it’s time to stop procrastinating and get to work! The Recording Academy announced earlier this week that the eligibility year for the 2020, 62nd Grammy Awards show will close on August 31. This is one month earlier than the usual cut off period artists are accustomed to. What’s the point of shortening the eligibility period by a month?The alteration was made due to the early airing of the 2020 telecast. In order to not clash with the Academy Awards, next years Grammy Awards will air on Jan. 26, about two weeks earlier than usual. Speaking of the Academy Awards, the Motion Picture Academy announced last September that their 2020 telecast would also be moved up two weeks. With all these changes, how will it affect artists and their music releases?With the period of eligibility now at 11 months rather than 12, to have a chance for the 2020 Grammy Awards, recordings must be released between Oct 1, 2018, and August 31, 2019. Moreover, recordings released after September 1, 2019, will be looked at for the 2021 awards. Interestingly, this is only the second time in history that the eligibility period has shortened. Back in 2009, the eligibility year was cut short to avoid competing with the upcoming Vancouver Winter Olympics.It’s unlikely that the modified dates will hinder the music quality or fairness of the competition. The Recording Academy has announced these date changes early enough, allowing artists to plan ahead. On the other hand, we can expect more music to be released this summer, as artists want to be ahead of the Aug. 31 cut off date. Be sure to save those dates!Have questions about the GRAMMY Awards eligibility date changes or how the whole submission and peer voting process works?

Last night, Ghastly was apparently roofied while DJing during Miami Music Week.Wow lol thanks for the free drugs whoever put them in my drink but I prefer to not dj on rohypnol u fkn tool— Ghastly (◕,,,◕) (@Ghastly) March 29, 2019After a few drinks, he blacked out for 6-7 hours and woke up in his hotel room. We don’t have any more details at the moment but we are glad he is safe now.I’m fine now, but the last 6 er 7 hours are completely gone, had three drinks and suddenly boom I woke up in my hotel room and I know what a hangover or a blackout feels like this is something different even writing this is really odd but thanks craig ily— Ghastly (◕,,,◕) (@Ghastly) March 29, 2019“Roofie”, otherwise known as rohypnol, is often known as a date rape drug. The perpetrator will usually slip the pill into someone’s drink at a party. Once the victim loses consciousness, the perp will then either try to rape/steal from the victim.Drug use is common in the music scene but it is definitely not ok to forcefully use it on someone else. In Ghastly’s case, we are speechless on what kind of asshole would do that to him, especially while he is DJing for a party.As MMW continues, we ask that everyone watch out for themselves, friends, and, others around them. The music scene is no place for any type of negativity like this.",articles11,['MMW']

"It has nearly been a year since we lost one of the most influential artists and producers in the electronic music world. On April 20th, 2018, Tim “Avicii” Bergling passed away from an apparent suicide. Today, (March 26th, 2019) Avicii’s family announced the launch of the Tim Bergling Foundation, in honor of his memory. The foundation will focus on suicide prevention and mental health.According to a press release from his family,At only 28 years old, the world lost Avicii far too soon. He was a young artist who gained unspeakable amounts of fame, and dealt with the pressures that excessive touring can bring on. He primarily coped with this industry pressure with alcohol, which had a destructive impact on his overall health. The documentary ‘Avicii: True Stories’ provides insight on the constant pressure he endured as an artist. We learn that Avicii retired from touring in 2016, after playing over 800 shows from the time he was 18.Avicii’s unique sound changed the pace of the electronic music scene. From artistic tributes from fellow artists, to a beautiful homage at the Swedish Grammys, the world continues to mourn the loss of this beautiful soul.At the end of the press release, his family states,Rest in peace, Avicii.",articles11,['Today']
"There’s no denying that Justin Bieber has had a tumultuous past. From messy breakups, to DUIs, resisting arrest, and assault—tumultuous almost seems like an understatement. Even so, we have to give him credit that he’s been pretty tame in the news lately. His marriage to Hailey Baldwin and religion has definitely had some pull in his reform. Coming to terms with what contributed to his troubled past, Bieber is now taking a step back from music to focus on himself.It was only in February when the 25-year-old opened up about his struggle with drugs and sex. Justin further added that making music now stresses him out. Considering how he was launched into this grown-up industry at the young age of 14, there’s no lack of empathy in seeing how he turned out this way.Earlier this month, Biebs took to Instagram to express how much he’s been struggling. Only weeks later, Bieber has now returned to Instagram again to share the post below.   So I read a lot of messages saying you want an album .. I’ve toured my whole teenage life, and early 20s, I realized and as you guys probably saw I was unhappy last tour and I don’t deserve that and you don’t deserve that, you pay money to come and have a lively energetic fun light concert and I was unable emotionally to give you that near the end of the tour. I have been looking, seeking, trial and error as most of us do, I am now very focused on repairing some of the deep rooted issues that I have as most of us have, so that I don’t fall apart, so that I can sustain my marriage and be the father I want to be. Music is very important to me but Nothing comes before my family and my health. I will come with a kick ass album ASAP, my swag is undeniable and my drive is indescribable his love is supernatural his grace is that reliable…. the top is where I reside period whether I make music or not the king said so. 👑 but I will come with a vengeance believe that.. (grammar and punctuation will be terrible pretend it’s a text where u just don’t care).A post shared by  Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on He admits to how much he’s let his fans down now and during his last tour. He also acknowledges that he’s currently working on some “deep rooted issues”. Bieber finishes off his post by explaining that his main priority at this time is to focus on his marriage, and promises to return one day, some day, soon with a kick ass album.This industry is no joke and we’ve seen many musicians and artists break from the stress of it all. We only wish the best for him as he pulls through this difficult time— good luck, Biebs!",articles11,"['Justin Bieber', 'Earlier', 'Instagram', 'Only', 'Instagram', 'ASAP', 'u', 'Justin Bieber']"
"Osheaga Music Festival just revealed their 2019 lineup stacked with fantastic acts from a multitude of genres. The three day festival across August 2-3-4 will take place in Parc Jean-Drapeau, Montreal, Canada. Osheaga’s 2018 iteration saw artists such as ODESZA, Yotto, Rezz, and San Holo.Day one does not include many electronic acts. However, Flume is headlining alongside The Lumineers and more.

Now, we have concrete evidence of new Dog Blood music coming at us.Alex, aka Boys Noize, sent out this Snapchat that confirmed our hopes about new Dog Blood music:Throw in the mix that Sonny, aka Skrillex, had this to say on Twitter a few days ago:V sooooon https://t.co/W5t5A2hZ3D— Skrillex (@Skrillex) March 25, 2019Put it all together with their upcoming Ultra Music Festival performance, and we have the recipe for something special.

"A ZHU and Disclosure collaboration? That sounds too good to be true, and in fact it was. While no one could have seen it coming, this photo perplexed us all.On this now-deleted IG story on ZHU’s account, the greatest team up we could have watched is  true (for now…). As hot gossip bred like wildfire, we anxiously wondered what the dynamic electronic duo and Ringo’s Desert artist had in store. This alone could’ve made the rest of our year.After the rush of excitement subsided, ZHU stepped in and explained via Twitter below.There’s a rumor floating around about ZHU x DISCLOSURE. This currently does not exist.— ZHU (@ZHUmusic) March 26, 2019While is not the good news we were hoping for, we eagerly await what happens in the future. Perhaps it’s a marketing tactic or perhaps it’s just not the right time.The mixture of Guy and Howard’s unique, genre bending musical style plus Steven’s masterful dark mysterious beats would captivate anyone.There is still no explanation on how this rumor got started. Let’s keep an eye out and open ear for more updates. Surely, this will happen. Even if ZHU x Disclosure is not a thing, there are tons of artists and new collaborations waiting for us. All across the dance music spectrum at Ultra Music Festival this coming weekend, it’s going to be lit!2019 is a new year full of new music and artists. Many festivals await us and so much excitement to come regardless.Good things come to those who wait. We’ve waited for Disclosure to come back, and they did.

"On the eve of Ultra and Miami Music Week, one of the biggest draws of the entire week is cancelling 3 highly anticipated performances. On Tuesday rumors began bubbling that Eric Prydz was cancelling shows in Miami. Then the rumors grew more grim as his Thursday Pryda show was removed from the Wynwood Factory website. Then Tuesday evening, Eric Prydz announced officially that he was cancelling his Pryda show at Wynwood Factory and his headlining Ultra sets on Friday with Adam Beyer and on Sunday during ASOT.In a Twitter post Eric said he had an acute medical condition that isn’t allowing him to travel at all.I am really sorry but due to an acute medical condition I am unable to travel or perform in Miami this week. I am truly gutted to miss any shows but especially Miami as this is one of my favourite times of the year.— Eric Prydz (@ericprydz) March 27, 2019This obviously comes as a huge shock and let down for the fans, many of whom travel and plan specifically to see Eric. His Thursday night show was so popular it sold out within minutes of tickets going on sale. Many ticket purchasers bought their tickets second-hand and will have no way to obtain refunds. Beyond that, his b2b with Adam Beyer was one of the biggest draws of Ultra’s new Resistance Island and leaves a glaring hole in the lineup with only days to go. It also leaves a glaring hole in the ASOT lineup on Sunday right before Armin’s closing set.It’s hard not to feel the parallels to 2014 when Avicii cancelled his headlining set last minute, although obviously the circumstances were more dire in that case. However, the gravity of his absence is possibly even greater than Avicii in 2014. In that instance Ultra rushed to secure deadmau5 to fill the slot at a huge price premium. It’s unclear at this point what Ultra is going to do, and surely Humans Alike is in a very tight situation as well.Wynwood Factory Pryda ticket holders will get a refund and free week-long pass for before midnight entry to Wynwood Factory shows. We wish we had better news and we’re not entirely sure who’s going to fill in for those massive holes in Ultra’s lineup, but stay tuned for more information.",articles11,"['Eric Prydz', 'Eric Prydz', 'Armin’s']"
"Cube 3.0 is set to debut in Virginia Key at Ultra Music Festival Miami this weekend. The long-awaited setup is sure to be a mind-blowing experience for all Ultra-heads in attendance. Obviously, there is a long history behind the magnificence of the Cube. From this, one begins to wonder exactly how Deadmau5 reached this milestone in his stage production. So, let’s take a closer look at where it all began and where it’s at now.We start this dive by going back to 2010, when Deadmau5 debuted his first iteration of the Cube stage. Whether you caught it at Coachella or at a venue in your hometown, it was something never seen before. In turn, you knew you were witnessing the evolution of EDM in real time. It definitely put Deadmau5 in a class with Daft Punk with regard to his influence on the industry. Ironically, the Mau5head helmet he dons during his sets could probably trace its roots back to the robot helmets Daft Punk wears. Remember, this was at a time when the DVDJ’s were considered to be at the forefront of visual experiences in DJing.That year, Samantha Oltman caught up with him at Outside Lands Music Festival in San Francisco and was able to get him to speak about the state of industry at the time:Next, he upgraded his production with the roll-out of Cube 2.0 and 2.1 in 2016 & 2017 respectively. At Veld Music Festival, Cube 2.0 took the production to new heights. With rotating parts and more intense graphics, fans the world over had something new to lose their minds to. In response to the high demand, the 2.1 version was rolled out. That model brought a slimmed down version that made the setup accessible to more venues. Thus, the evolution of the Cube has been incremental but ever game-changing nonetheless.Fast forward to February 2019. In a revealing interview, just days before Cube 3.0’s debut, he sits and talks to Miami New Times’ Kat Bein. She went in on the Mau5 and was able to get a much closer look at the history of the setup. First she details the history of Joel Zimmerman from his days as a web designer to the EDM legend he is today. She even uncovered the nugget of him getting his Mau5 helmet idea from a death-pop singer. Second, she details how part of Deadmau5′ roots came from his coding background. During this time he hones his audio composition skills but was also mastering the visual coding techniques. Clearly, this skill set is what has made the evolution of his Cube stage so seamless.Register for your tickets here!",articles11,"['Daft Punk', 'Samantha Oltman', 'Deadmau5′']"
"Beyond WonderlandMarch 22 – 23 NOS Events CenterSan BernardinoCalifornia.110,000Armin van BuurenDeadmau5, REZZ, ZHUSouthern CaliforniaBeyond Wonderland90+ artist2019‘s Beyond Wonderland consisted of four different stages. These being Queen’s Domain, Mad Hatter’s Castle, Caterpillar’s Garden, and Cheshire Woods. This years event had dedicated VIP dance areas at all four of its stages, leaving those who like their elbow space a spot for them. Queen’s Domain was this year’s mainstage, which saw everyone from Rezz, to Seven Lions, Salvatore Ganacci, and Deorro grace the stage. As expected, they absolutely tore the place apart.Mad Hatter’s Castle had a very Bass heavy lineup Friday night, as it was hosted by Bassrush. This saw the likes of Dubloadz, Ganja White Night, and Rusko take the stage, with the latter putting on one of the best performances I’ve ever seen from the English DJ & Record Producer. Saturday night saw a more diverse lineup for the Castle. Scheduled for the night were YehMe2 (Formally 1/2 of Flosstradamus), ZHU, Said The Sky, and SAYMYNAME, who all brought the heat.Caterpillars Garden was a bit crazy when compared to the other stages. On Friday night, it was hosted by Dreamstate, enchanting the dancefloor with artists Andrew Rayel, Liquid Soul, and Aly & Fila. Saturday night was a whole other story. It was Saturday night that Basscon took control of the garden and really turned things up a couple of notches.Lady Faith, DJ Isaac, & Darren Styles all brought their varying styles of Bass music crushing the dancefloor in the process. The night culminated in a Lil Texas set, which saw the Tex-Core creator close out the stage. If you haven’t seen Lil Texas yet, I highly recommend you do. The man might just be the face of the new American Hardcore Movement.Various stages we’re hosted by Bassrush, BASSCON, Dreamstate, & Insomniac Records. In addition to these, this years event was a special one. This is because Mau5trap played host to the Cheshire Woods stage for the very first time on Friday night. The Woods featured artist like i_o, Feed Me, & No Mana, as well as numerous others. It goes without saying that the night was full of non-stop Mau5trap action. The night culminated with another first, with that being Testpilot’s first Beyond Wonderland performance.Insomniac Records hosted Cheshire Woods on Saturday night. Those who found themselves at the stage were in for a treat. Codes, Bijou, Wax Motif, & Noizu were all performing, and if you’re familiar with them you know that they are some of the best at what they do. These stages were STACKED.If this year’s Beyond Wonderland was the first time you’ve seen Seven Lions then you were in for a special treat. Seven Lions is notorious for incorporating a variety of styles of dubstep, psytrance, and melodic tracks within his set. This weekend, Seven Lions ended his remarkable set with the vocals from his recent collaborative track “First Time” with Slander and Dabin. As the Queen’s Domain lit up with massive energy, the entire crowd shouted the vocals to “First Time” to end Seven Lions performance strong.Beyond Wonderland EkaliEkaliEkaliWith Insomniac being known for their art cars, as well as the surprise sets that get played on them it’s no secret that they had something in store for us. Hardwell‘s Hip Hop set during EDC ’17 on the Mayan Art Car is the perfect example of this. Another is the secret D&B set that Kaskade played at Beyond this year. If you were there, it was awesome. If not, then check this out. This took place at their secret ‘Rabbit Hole‘ stage. I even managed to snag a few moments of a rare tech-house set from Carnage at this stage.Nick LedesmaAdam AuburnInsomniaExchange LA,Beyond WonderlandLAInsomniacAll in all, Beyond Wonderland is definitely a festival I would come back to a second or even third time. The overall experience as a headliner is something I think everyone should experience. The festival is amazing in both GA and VIP sections. The music is great, the people are lovely, and the vibe is amazing. The experience that the team over at Insomniac is able to cultivate is just out of this world.There were moments where Beyond Wonderland felt more like EDC. I say this because its stages were stacked, and set times were rather hard to choose between. This notion vanished as you quickly realized that the festival was actually just the right size. This is only because it was so easy to make it to different stages with nothing but a brisk walk.Beyond Wonderland is expected to return to Southern California in 2020.  Stay tuned for more news at their official website here.",articles11,"['Mad Hatter’s Castle', 'Caterpillar’s', 'Bassrush', 'Dubloadz', 'Ganja White Night', 'Saturday', 'ZHU', 'SAYMYNAME', 'Dreamstate', 'Aly & Fila', 'Lady Faith', 'Darren Styles', 'Bassrush', 'Dreamstate', 'Testpilot’s', 'Wax Motif', 'Beyond Wonderland', 'Carnage', 'Beyond Wonderland']"

"After two years of lobbying and editing, Article 13 has been approved by the EU Parliament. The vote ended at 348 to 274. Article 13— which has now been renumbered to Article 17— will make huge platforms like Google, YouTube, and Facebook responsible for any copyright infringements on their sites. The bill is an attempt to give artists and publishers compensation for using their content. At first glance, this sounds like a fair deal. Why shouldn’t creators and journalists receive profit off of their content and their hard work? The controversy, however, comes out in the details, or lack thereof.Google has outright condemned the EU’s decision. They have strongly lobbied against this measure.“[This action will] lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe’s creative and digital economies.”It may change the way the internet works (at least in Europe). Think about that. All of the music you listen to on YouTube or clips of shows may be filtered out. This puts a strain on these companies to use expensive measures to manage their users’ content and censor their data.Copyright lawyers have been critical of this bill as well. The wording in the bill can be a bit vague. That flexibility leaves room for uncertainty. It may lead these tech companies to ‘play it safe’ by blocking content and removing links to other articles.The modern form of the internet has only been alive for about 25 years. It’s remarkable to see how fast it has developed since then. As it grows, it has made it hard for the world to adjust their laws into the virtual world. Article 17 is giving it a try.So far, tech companies have been profiting off the content shared on their platforms, but the people behind the work have not received any additional payments. This bill would make Google pay the original publishers for any use of their work, whether it’s a video or just a clip. This would also help eliminate piracy.Parliament had this to say in their final note about the matter:“This directive is an important step towards correcting a situation which has allowed a few companies to earn huge sums of money without properly remunerating the thousands of creatives and journalists whose work they depend on”Many Europeans are angry about this law. Thousands joined together in Germany to protest the actions of the EU Parliament.While it may be beneficial to artists, the downside is that this opens the gates of censorship. To what extent will users be censored from their freedom of speech? The modern internet could change drastically, and some are recognizing that this measure could endanger memes.The next step is for the European Council to approve the bill, and from there the bill moves to become law. If it passes all of these steps, the law could be implemented in two years. Julia Reda, a German MEP, called this event, “dark day for internet freedom.”Source: Dailymail UK",articles11,"['Google', 'Facebook', 'Europeans', 'Julia Reda']"

Orlando is the only remaining EDC in the US besides Las Vegas so this is welcome news.In a social media post, Pasquale announced that EDCO will grow to 3 days. On top of that it’s going to get more stages, larger production and a bigger festival footprint. After banishing trance in 2018 we can be sure that trance will return in 2019! EDC will now touch down in Orlando on Nov 8-10 of 2019. Perhaps the most interesting thing is that Tinker Field aka Camping World Stadium received no mention at all. Could EDC be moving venues?

"A Missouri Enterprise Car Rental worker recently took it into his own hands to get his co-workers in a better mood. The 19-year-old male reportedly spiked his co-workers’ drinks with LSD in an attempt to reverse their “negative energy”. The effected co-workers did not approve to taking the drugs and had to be transported to the hospital.  Let’s just say, he’s not going to be winning employee of the month anytime soon.“They were too uptight, and they needed to have better energy“.According to The Kansas City Star, the unidentified male, was arrested last Monday where he eventually admitted to his ploy. His manager, who did not consume any LSD, caught him in the act, messing with someone else’s drink. To make it even more obvious, he was holding a water dropper and “acting weird”. The manager stated he didn’t alert the police until the two other employees began acting out of control.The two employees targeted, a 24-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman unknowingly consumed the LSD and immediately showed relating symptoms. Fortunately, they were safely monitored at the hospital where the drugs wore off. Now, the 19-year-old faces charges of second-degree assault and possession of a controlled substance, once police test the co-workers’ drinks. We can comfortably assume that he will not be returning to Enterprise after this entire incident.",articles11,[None]

Two months ago, End of the Rainbow Festival was announced as a replacement for Sasquatch! Music Festival. It was set to kick off from Friday May 24th through Sunday, May 26th. However, the music world just received news that End of the Rainbow Festival is “postponed indefinitely.” See below for the announcement, per The Festive Owl’s Facebook page.As a result, ticket refunds from Ticketmaster have already been issued to original ticket purchasers. However, people have voiced concerns and frustrations about travel arrangements that have already been made (plane tickets, hotel reservations, etc.). Event cancellations are certainly always tough, with or without knowing the reason for their cancellation.Stay tuned for news on End of the Rainbow festival – perhaps we will see it rescheduled for another time or another venue in the future.",articles11,"['Paradiso', 'Ticketmaster']"
"New music from Dog Blood? Yes, please! Just a few weeks ago, the duo confirmed that new tunes are on the way. And now, it seems like it’s finally here. The iconic duo played at BUKU Festival last weekend and started their set with what appears to be a new ID. Fortunately, a fan captured a few minutes on video for everyone to see. The intro kicks off with low bass before exotic vocal chops blast away. From there, screechy synths are thrown into the fray and sounds very similar to the old DB sound.2019 is shaping up to be the year of Dog Blood. it has been a very exciting few months since Skrillex and Boys Noize announced their project’s return to the EDM circuit. Their monumental return to Ultra Music Festival will be one for the books. They are also bringing the heat to Brownie & Lemonade’s warehouse party on March 28th at the Mana Wynwood Warehouse. The dog boy’s appearances are rare so if you’re in Miami this week, be sure to catch at least one of their sets.Beyond their Miami appearance, DB is also slated to perform at Sunset Music Festival. Check out their intro at BUKU Festival below and let us know if you think it’s new Dog Blood music!",articles11,"['Yes', '! Just', 'DB', 'Noize', 'DB']"
"A year ago today Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello reunited as one for the first time since 2013 reforming the legendary Swedish House Mafia. The trio made an appearance as the biggest surprise of Ultra Music Festival’s 20th Anniversary by closing out the mainstage. Day OneA post shared by @ swedishhousemafia on 3.25.18 marks more than just day one of Swedish House Mafia getting back together, it was the day 3 best friends who hadn’t all seen each other in 5 years got back together to do what they love. From the first track, euphoria set in Swedish House Mafia is actually back, hearing all the classic SHM tracks, ‘Miami 2 Ibiza‘, ‘Save The World‘, ‘Antidote‘, ‘One‘, ‘Greyhound‘,’Don’t You Worry Child‘, even artists couldn’t contain their excitement. The trio gave us a small taste of what’s next for SHM when they took us into the club for a little bit playing 2 ID tracks that are still unknown to this day. Axwell finished off the set by saying “It’s Swedish House Mafia for life this time!”We are so excited to see what’s in store for Swedish House Mafia in 2019. In a little over a month, SHM will unite in their homeland of Sweden May 2nd-4th to perform at Tele2 Arena.  Various other dates all around the globe have already been announced and can be seen here. Unfortunately for the USA, a date has yet to be announced. Hopefully, that can change soon! We all know the cryptic ways of Swedish House Mafia so only time will tell.But until then, let’s relive the euphoric closing set by the legendary Swedish House Mafia!Ultra 2018

There’s some major FOMO for those who missed Beyond Wonderland. There were a lot of insane moments. Between a hypnotizing Zhu and a wild Deadmau5 set, it’s hard to decide. However, the best takeaway from the weekend might be Kaskade, popping up unannounced, and dropping a full drum and bass (DnB) set at the secret Rabbit Hole stage.Fans over Twitter have shared a conglomeration of elation, sadness, and everything in between. Kaskade isn’t known for producing drum n bass, although he did have one DnB release in 1997 as DJ Radon. Most of us were not old enough to rave then so for him to bring back this style of dance music, which has been underappreciated by the mainstream EDM culture, is so f—-g dope. Check out a clip shared by @czarcruise: I see you throwing down some DnB @kaskade 👀.

"To the entire music community, we wanted to let you know that a new study showed that music helps with Alzheimers and dementia. Remember that feeling of being moved by a song? That not only helps your mind and soul, but also your body.The salience network (SN) is a large scale brain network of the human brain that is primarily composed of the anterior insula (AI) and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). It involves detecting and filtering salient stimuli, and recruiting relevant functional networks. It links to the Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR). Musical perception, musical emotion, and musical memory survive long after other forms of cognitive function and memory disappear.Music captures our culture and identity. We all listen to music through recordings, playing an instrument, attending concerts, or dancing. We get a unique emotional experience with personal and social meaning. From soothing jazz, blaring 140 bpm techno, and possibly even country–listening to familiar music elicits pleasurable responses.According to The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimers Disease, our favorite music becomes weaponized against Alzheimers and dementia. It numbs anxiety for patients and combats its memory-distorting effects.“We believe music will tap into the salience network of the brain that is still relatively functioning.” -Jeff Anderson M.D. P.H.D., associate professor in radiology at the University of UtahAnderson believes music can act as an effective treatment for sufferers. While there is still much more to be clarified on this study in varying levels of dementia, we know one thing. Music works as a way to slow the onset or help with improving it.A graduate student, Jace King, found that headphones brought patients “back to life” after putting them on dementia patients and familiar music played. Music anchors and grounds them back to reality.Quite an interesting study and one that is as simple as plugging into your phone. Music therapy is something we can all get behind.",articles11,"['Alzheimers', 'Alzheimers', '“We']"
"Several Ibiza venues will be forced to pay heavy fines as a result of new licensing laws. It’s reported that Ibiza’s San Antonio council has imposed a staggering €1.4 million in fines to venues in the West End. What’s the cause for such hefty fines? Sound pollution. According to the Diario de Ibiza, 345 complaints have been received since the new licensing laws were set in place. As expected, a majority of the complaints are due to noise infractions or promoting events without the necessary permission.Last March, specific licensing laws were created to control sound levels in the West End, San Antonio. The West End areas were officially declared a Special Acoustic Protection Zone (ZPAW) after several noise infractions over the past years. In addition, the curfew was reduced from 5 am to 3 am to combat the noise. Now, around 20 venues will face fines, some also having to close for a period of 80 days.The Diario De Ibiza explains that the fines fall into two groups. The first group, San Antonio’s tax office, is collecting around $714,000 worth of fines. Around $846,000, which is to be split among 20 venues, is also being processed as we speak. All in all, we hope these venues bounce back quickly and improve their policies to avoid something like this from happening again. Many of the venues are working to end this nightmare ASAP to prepare for the summer crowds.",articles11,"['Ibiza', 'Last March', 'The West End', 'De Ibiza', 'Antonio’s', 'ASAP']"
"Apparently, in 2019 even DJ’s can be arrested at the most inconvenient times. While performing at Bassmnt in San Diego Malaa was arrested on stage during his set. Fans captured video of the masked DJ/producer getting taken into custody. However, they have been quick to point out some inconsistencies.En plein set au Bassmnt Club, Malaa se fait arrêter par la police. Coup de comm’ ou véritable arrestation?🤔 pic.twitter.com/uxQ5JBde5l— Guettapen (@Guettapen) March 24, 2019The first thing to point out here is that the arresting police officers did not remove Malaa’s mask prior to cuffing him and escorting him offstage. Since Malaa wants to keep his identity secret since it is a key element of the Malaa brand, it would have made for a convenient oversight on their part. In addition, none of the officers tried to stop the audience from recording the scene. It’s seemed that fans were encouraged to get as much captured. It has also been pointed out that one of the cops was recognized from a viral video and is an actor.MALAA JUST GOT ARRESTED Wtf #freemalaa pic.twitter.com/hzFVy66Ank— Cookie Rojas 🍪 (@Vjordan_58) March 24, 2019This stunt definitely fits well within the rest of the themes around the Malaa project.

"GoFundMe and the internet overall can provide us with great feel-good moments. We know the website can be used for good use. Just a few months ago a campaign was started for the Fyre Festival caterers who lost lots of money. However, the website can also be used for completely unnecessary reasons. Just recently Sorority Sisters tried to upgrade one of their friends to VIP passes for Coachella. Because attending the festival without one is a crazy and unimaginable thought.The best part of this story is the reasoning behind it. In the description of the GoFundMe they detailed why Mackenzie couldn’t afford it in the first place. Sorority life can be tough, am I right?It’s actually pretty funny that this campaign got off the ground. A few things to note is the fact that she has only had this dream for 3 months! There are people that have waited years to go to this festival. And she went on a Spring Break Trip and that is the major reason she doesn’t have enough money for VIP.Anything over like $30 helps!To give background on the story and its tragic reasons of needing a VIP pass. Last year, the same girl group went to Lollapalozza. Every girl had a VIP pass except for Mackenzie. They had to suffer through most of the festival without going into the VIP section but eventually went, leaving their friend behind. Sounds like a great friendship to me!Believe it or not the GoFundMe goal has been met. I know you all were eager to donate to this cause. The donor to give Mackenzie her dream of VIP was actually her Dad.

"In case you didn’t get the memo, Joel Zimmerman spins techno as Testpilot. He first debuted the alter ego in 2017 on BBC Radio 1‘s Essential Mix show during his yearlong residency. Finally, after much begging and pleading by fans, he’s bringing the moniker back to life. As a special treat, he dropped a nasty b2b set with himself live on BBC Radio 1. He did two hours as both Testpilot and Deadmau5. The set is available to stream now on Soundcloud, in case you missed it.It’s hard to remember the last time BBC Radio 1 had such an epic b2b set. A good example would probably be Eric Prydz b2b Jeremy Olander (also available on Soundcloud) from a few years back. On top of that, when’s the last time someone b2b’d with themselves? Outside of some schizophrenic DJ in England claiming to be the first, it’s pretty unheard of. This makes Joel’s latest guest mix all the more epic as a result.The two-hour mix starts off with Joel dropping his Testpilot set. It opens with about 20 minutes of club-y, mainstream house. However, before any disappointment sets in, the mix quickly descends into the underground. The next 45 minutes are filled with filthy techno and tech-house beats that should have every true techno-head salivating for more. Mr. Zimmerman follows that up with an hour of contemporary Deadmau5 vibes. Although, many of the beats are remixes or re-edits. It’s sure to leave you screaming, “ID’s please!” (There’s a sick ‘Raise Your Weapon‘ techno remix at 20:04 by the way.) Overall, the mix is straight fire and definitely should not be slept on.While we’re still waiting on some new Testpilot music, his mixes will have to hold us over. Fortunately, when the mixes do come out they’re next level. Also, Joel’s been doing Testpilot sets more frequently, like the surprise Testpilot set he just did at Beyond Wonderland (he was booked only as Deadmau5). Hopefully, we’ll see more of the same at either of his dates at Las Vegas‘ newest superclub Kaos, in April. Get your tickets here or here. Above all else, you can avoid the fear of missing out because the full Essential Mix set is live on Soundcloud now.

"Last week, Tritonal stopped in New York City to perform one of the biggest shows of their career. Their radio show, Tritonia, has achieved 250 episodes and the duo of Chad and Dave decided to throw down a massive show at Terminal 5 to celebrate the monumental accomplishment. We had the opportunity to sit down with the duo to reflect on their majorly successful careers as well as talk about what’s to come next. Check out the full interview below.We’ll start off with a big question. Obviously you guys, you know that Tritonia 250 is an absolutely huge accomplishment. Now that you’ve accomplished this, what’s the next big goal for you guys? What’s next on the horizon? Dave: Well it’s great that you said it was an accomplishment because it is we never really saw it like that when we started the show. We’re just experiencing it as it goes. So that’s one thing just to note. We’re super grateful to celebrate that here in New York City, she’s been sort of a pinnacle. We’ve had Electric Zoo here and we’ve done Pacha Marquee, we’ve got Lavo. It’s great city for Tritonal in general.Chad: But you know, I think short term, the U&ME album, it has been an achievement. It’s been a two year journey to get this body of work together. It also represents a sound or style of Tritonal. All that has been the sort of things that we’ve been making for the last 24 months as well. So the album is going to drop in May. This tour represents the culmination of that as well. What’s after that is as I feel like David and I want to take up a moment to have a collective breath and really artistically, creatively get in the studio and, figure out where we want to go next. Because, because we’ve, we’ve never really been, I mean I think people think about Tritonal, they think about a sound, whether it’s, you know, a record like ‘Colors’ or ‘Now or Never’.A lot of your songs have a similar vibe to them that defines Tritonal. Would you guys be interested in expand that in terms of producing in a new genre?Chad: Yeah, actually we’d like to go back to the roots to be honest, a little bit of real progressive house and we will be tip toeing to back to trance a little bit. So the exciting thing is that over the years I feel like we’ve cultivated a toolbox of production skills that we can sort of now dig into and say, what do we want to play with? And the only way to really find that out is to go within and search your soul and experiment, listen to stuff and just see what the fuck we want to do.You guys had been in studio nonstop and just putting out track after track. Is there one specific song that you guys have a special story for that just stands out to you guys?Dave: I mean I can speak for myself, it’s the record that we have called ‘Satellite‘. It may not be one of our biggest records, but it’s open some eyes and ears and it’s just fun to play.Chad: Right now a record that I’m really proud of that nobody’s heard is a record called ‘Medicine‘. It’s mad and a drum and bass record, an exclusive trancey drum and bass track. The vocalist is a little bit like Christina Soto and she’s just gorgeous on this record. Looking back, what was the moment for you guys that, where you guys said “we made it”?Chad: I think that’s happened a few times. Recognize the stepping stones along the way, but we’ve never had a moment where we’re like “we’ve made it”. But we’ve had moments where we said oh wow, we just went from no gigs to Russia kind of overnight. There’s a lot of gratitude for that. We’re playing around in Texas local shows and doing what we could to get shows in Austin and San Antonio. But that record, and I think we’ve been, I don’t know, four weeks we had offers in Honolulu. We had offers of Moscow, we had offers in Bali. We just had offers or wasn’t in volume. It was Indonesia make a syrup I or some shit. But like do we see that wasn’t that break breakthrough traffic, it was like international offers coming in. And then other ones too, like la and Seattle and you know, within six months we were like kind of, we weren’t established by any fucking mean. We definitely hadn’t made it. But there was a massive change in momentum.Dave: I think probably one of the biggest ones was ‘Now or Never’ followed up by records like ‘Colors’. And then you like Untouchable Tour with Cash Cash. Untouchable was mainly our most commercially successful record. It’s on Dancing With The Stars four times, it was on ESPN, and NCAA finals halftime.You guys have done so many collaborations with so many different artists. Who’s next for you guys? Who do you want to collaborate with next? Chad: So we both would love to at some point to collab with Illenium. Love that he’s kind of like Said the Sky. We want to collaborate with some smaller acts too. We’re talking to some guys that nobody knows of and it’s really more about the sauce. Those things have to happen naturally though. ‘Until You Were Gone’ was very, very natural. It happened over text. It was back and forth. We finished the record in 10 days. Cash Cash was like that too We wrote ‘Untouchable’ in LA in a studio. We’ve had our biggest hits come. They just fall from the sky into the room and it’s like, oh, I’ve got this melody. We should think about this. And you’re like, oh fuck. That’s cool. It’s inspiration.You guys have played mainstages all over the world. What has been your favorite performance?Chad: EDC.

Kinetic and Circuit Grounds are equally massive. And um, and we played after one of our all time legendary heroes, BT. His daughter up there with them and we’re like, how are we even on the stage with this guy? Playing after us is fucking Armin, you know, Jesus himself is on after. It was just awesome.Do you have anything you want to share with you that your fans and our readers? Dave: Thank you. I think just gratitude.

Who just happens to be Steve Angello.And this luxury home can be yours for the low price of $5.75 million or a $25,000 per month lease. You do however get your money’s worth though. The House stretches over 6,000 square feet. And it includes four bedrooms, six bathrooms, a full in-home recording studio and a two-story music room.

"There is a new update in the ride service situation for Ultra 2019. According to the Miami Herald, the festival organizers, Miami county regulators, and Uber/Lyft representatives have finalized a transportation plan.The main issue was the exit strategy. The Rickenbacker Causeway is the only road connecting the city of Miami to Virginia Key and Key Biscayne, leaving attendees with only way way out. Ultra is expecting up to 60,000 people, which would make the traffic situation unbearable for residents and attendees. A representative from Uber shared the concern of the company and county officials.As a result of the Uber/Lyft ban, transportation might seem messy. Luckily, we’re here to break down your options.Just to clarify, the ban is only on sellingMMWYour only options to leave the festival grounds are through the shuttle buses or ferry. The bright side is that the shuttle is included with your ticket. The downside is that there will most likely be a lot of lines and chaos. Taking the ferry is a cool option, but it does cost extra. A three-day ferry pass is $149.95.The shuttle buses will take you to three mainland hubs: Arsht Center Station, American Airlines Arena, and the Vizcaya. The ferry takes you to the Bayside Market.From there, you are free to Uber, Lyft, or walk all you want. Explore Miami, go to an after-party, or whatever you want. When you’re ready to go home, whether it’s Kendall or Coconut Grove or up North in Ft. Lauderdale, you also have options. Miami-dade is allowing the Metrorail and Metromover to run 24 hours a day for that weekend.If you’re heading to Ft. Lauderdale or West Palm Beach and don’t feel like driving or paying for an expensive ass Uber, you can opt for the Brightline, a fast train service. Use the promo code GOSMART while booking your ride and you’ll receive 25% off the SMART train option.For more details, you can visit Ultra’s transport site.

"Back in 2017 Deadmau5 ran a series of monthly sets on the legendary BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix show. In June that year, he dropped a bangin’ techno set under his Testpilot alias. As a result, techno heads have been craving some more of his techno production. Earlier this month, fans finally got another taste when he released his Electric Forest set. However, that seemed to just create a more intense craving for that Testpilot sound. Fortunately, fans won’t have to wait long to get their fix.On top of all of this, he’s already set to roll out his new Cube 3.0 rig at Ultra Miami. Then, he’ll be bringing his talents to Vegas for a few shows at XS Nightclub. Therefore, it should be easy to see why Deadmau5 is set to drop a fresh techno set tonight. He’s lining himself up for another huge festival season.When looking at the bigger picture, one thing is for certain: This Testpilot set on BBC Radio 1 tonight will be one for the books.

"In celebration of their 15th year at Coachella, the Do LaB has brought along a whole new stage design and their biggest lineup yet. Year after year, these creative minds and artistic leaders have crafted a one-of-a-kind experience. The 2019 lineup is full of both established acts and up-and-comers alike. Meaning there’s a little something for everyone.Each weekend will get their own unique show. Those going to Weekend One will be treated to the likes of Peter Tong b2b a surprise special guest. As well as Bleep Bloop, Dombresky, Dom Dolla and so much more. As for Weekend Two, a few of what they’ll be getting is Justin Jay, Eagles & Butterflies, and The Floozies.However, perhaps the best part of the Do LaB experience is their mantra of “Expect the unexpected”. They are notorious for bringing out special guests that no one could ever see coming. In the past, they have surprised fans with shows from Skrillex, Major Lazer, RÜFÜS DU SOL and so much more. There’s no telling who they’ll be bringing this year.And it’s not just the music that makes these shows special. They put so much care and thought into their production. Whether it be fantastical video installations or getting sprayed down by water guns, the Do LaB never disappoints.

"Dubstep DJ Getter has responded back to fans after a particularly negative reception at a recent concert date. In promotion of his latest album , Getter is touring with a 26-show schedule across the United States. Hitting some smaller, more intimate venues to feature his new sound, the response has been mostly positive.However, at his Houston show date on March 15, Getter was booed aggressively by fans. These “fans” were expecting his typical dubstep show filled with bangers, but got a much different experience.The album  is about as close to a 180-degree shift from what you have typically come to expect from Getter. However, the album is truly great – highs and lows, vocal tracks, ambient tunes – it just isn’t very mainstream. Kind of like when you graduate from light beer to IPAs, it takes an experienced palate to enjoy his new sound.By all accounts, Houston was a “light beer” kind of crowd. The booing and following social media ridicule forced a response from Getter. To his credit, he handled it with class:you know, i used to make music for the wrong reasons
i found something i can chase and is much more complex then some dumb trendy bullshit
ive spent all my money and time on something i love and thats literally all that matters to me.
boo me all u want, im still doing this shit— 𝕲𝖊𝖙𝖙𝖊𝖗 (@GetterOfficial) March 16, 2019We are at a strange time where we want every little experience to be “epic.” All these festivals with their light shows and fireworks, while wonderful, also are stomping a lot of the creativity out of what artists produce. When we don’t get our show of bangers, we say “They were the worst” or “It f***ing sucks.” We subtly extinguish the fire that drives artists to create for us. Because of this mentality, we are losing out on the nuances that take music from good to great.We can remember when Avicii debuted his  album at Ultra 2013. Say what you want after the fact, but that show caught some massive flack. It wasn’t appreciated at first. People just wanted tracks like ‘Levels‘.However, we have also been to shows where we just simply didn’t enjoy the music. We have seen artists perform and it just doesn’t do it for us. Perhaps that was the case with this Getter tour stop. There have been social media posts saying the sound EQ was off.thanks man!!! yea sound was a bit weird https://t.co/aBF2HJuxU2— 𝕲𝖊𝖙𝖙𝖊𝖗 (@GetterOfficial) March 16, 2019Regardless, I say bravo to Getter for staying true to himself. Pouring your heart and soul into anything is draining and taxing on the mind and body. It is easy for attendees to criticize and judge from the pit. It is a whole different story to put yourself out there, completely vulnerable, and see how people respond.I suggest we try practicing some more empathy and let these artists evolve. Like Jay-Z once said: “Want my old shit, buy my old album.” Don’t criticize without having the slightest clue what is driving these artists behind the scenes. Just embrace that they choose to share their creations with us through the medium that is music.Catch Getter on tour at one of his next stops!",articles11,['–']
"Music Festivals have the power to change our lives. If you have gone to one, you probably connect with that statement. They may provide us with a different outlook on life or make us fall in love with a specific artist. According to a recent study done by Cloud Cover Music, Ultra is the most life-changing festival since Woodstock. That is a pretty bold statement with all the incredible festivals out there.They surveyed 665 music fans who have attended music festivals. They asked all the important questions like which one was your favorite? Did the music festival change your life? 63% of the respondents said yes to a festival permanently changed their life.Woodstock took the #1 spot with 82.4% of people feeling their life has been altered. The highest modern-day festival is Ultra with 78.4%. And right behind them is EDC with 74.5% of people feeling their life was transformed because of the festival.It’s no doubt that Woodstock has had the most effect on people. It was a festival that changed social and cultural boundaries. You can’t really compare Ultra to Woodstock. You can, however, compare Ultra to the other EDM festivals on the list. Arguments could go on for days for who is the best festival. An interesting note is that Tomorrowland did not appear in the top ten, could be just Americans were polled and that is the reason.Cloud Cover Music also came to some other conclusions from the survey. The most memorable festival act was Red Hot Chili Peppers. Our very own Tiesto came in at #5. They also found the festivals have actually gotten less wild than back in the day. Drug use, nudity, and violence have all declined since the 80s. Of course, people may just not want to admit to those first two. Drinking, however, has actually increased among festival goers.Burning Man was rated the most indulgent festival when it comes to alcohol/hard drugs. They were also rated best place to form new friendships. EDC was rated most spiritual and artistic festival.Tough to say which festival is actually the most life-changing after Woodstock. 665 participants are probably not enough considering millions attend festivals each year. Which festival do you find has changed your life the most? ",articles11,"['Woodstock', 'Americans', 'Red Hot Chili Peppers', 'Burning Man']"

This week, Madeon was announced on the Lollapalooza lineup. That news is exciting enough, as it’s been a while since we’ve seen anything from the French Producer. This isn’t the first announcement from him either. He is also slated to play a DJ set at Porter Robinson’s Second Sky Festival. We all assumed Lolla would be a DJ set too, or maybe if we were lucky, his ‘Adventure’ Live set.But Madeon also tweeted that his Lolla set would be a live show. A fan asked for some clarification and he revealed that this is an entirely new show. Yes folks, we are  getting new Madeon! It’s not the album drop that we’ve all been (im)patiently waiting for, but since he’s playing a new set, the album can’t be far behind.This also means for all you lucky people who managed to grab a ticket to Second Sky, he might tease something new in his set there.

Some other oldies but goodies will be a nice treat. But Miley Cirus? Jay-Z? Cage The Elephant? The Racounters? Granted, some of these artists are great in their own right, but the iconic idea of Woodstock is not a Popfest.It is a gritty, filthy, barely livable music festival where the best in the music industry played for the love of their craft. Fans stormed in each day, walking miles, suffered the rain, mud, poor equipment, and every other thing that can go wrong in order to listen to the music and love each other.This idea may get fabricated along the way, but let’s be honest – this “Woodstock” ain’t no Woodstock.To cleanse the palate, here is Hendrix performing back at the real Woodstock in 1969.",articles11,"['Jimi Hendrix', 'Crosby', 'Nash/Young', 'Joan Baez', 'Grateful Dead', 'CCR', 'Janis Joplin', 'The Who –', 'Kaskade', '…', '–', 'Jay-Z', 'Cage The Elephant', 'Woodstock', 'Hendrix']"
"French DJ & Superstar David Guetta today finds himself not in the Hot 100 charts but rather in hot water. South African artist Daniel Baron has filed a lawsuit against Guetta for alleged copyright infringement. Baron accuses Guetta of ripping off his 2016 single “Children of the Sun” for his 2018 collaboration with Sia “Light Headed”.South African radio show invited Daniel Baron to chat about the similarities between the two songs. Below you can hear a snippet of the show in which they compare the similarities between the two tracks.Content hosted by iono.fmSo was this plagiarism on Guetta’s part or just a coincidence? Well, that’s up for you to decide after listening. However, another question that arose was where on earth could have David Guetta heard “Children of the Sun”? Well in the aforementioned interview Baron said he and his team did a bit of digging around. They found out Guetta was in South Africa for Ultra South Africa 2017. This was  around the time the song was released and “Children of the Sun” was massively popular in the country at the time and was receiving a fair bit of airtime on radio shows & in festival sets. In Baron’s own words:Baron also says he didn’t want to make a public scene with the allegations, so he first consulted with his music attorneys about the matter. He then with a formal legal letter approached Guetta & his label about the similarities between the two songs in December 2018. The letter asks Guetta to credit Baron and issue compensation for the use of his work. However, as it stands neither David Guetta or his label Warner Music has commented on it or even acknowledged the dispute in the first place.Digital Music News",articles11,"['Daniel Baron', 'Baron', 'Baron', 'Baron', 'David Guetta']"

"This past week at Alpe d’Huez, France the inaugural edition of Tomorrowland Winter took place. When it came to hosting a festival during winter, mother nature definitely threw some curveballs them.  Right before the start of the event, pictures leaked of a partial tear in the roof tarp material but luckily it was replaced by the start of the event. Soon after the epic festival was forced to evacuate 250 attendees due to a severe snowstorm. Ultimately, at the end of the festival, attendees were left with incredible memories that’ll last a lifetime. If you were unable to make it to the inaugural edition of Tomorrowland Winter, don’t worry there will always be next year!

"Arguably the Mecca of all EDM festivals, Tomorrowland has made more than a name for itself. So much so, that 2019 brought the first edition of Tomorrowland Winter located in Alpe d’Huez, France. Despite risk of a rocky start in the initial days due to inclement weather, Tomorrowland Winter wrapped up with huge success and the fun will continue on for 5 more years.However some changes are in the offing, as every year is a live and learn experience for planners of future seasons. Organizers will consider moving the actual festival to the weekend rather than Wed-Fri. They will also consider back to back weekends like in Belgium. Further planning for prophylactic and back-up measures may also be considered as severe snowstorm had forced over two-hundred people to be evacuated from the slopes just a day before the kickoff.Regardless, after seeing the dozens of magical videos and photos this past week, there is no arguing that Tomorrowland Winter has lived up to the name. With most festivals held in sunshine and summer warmth, Tomorrowland Winter really sets things apart and is a destination festival to be reckoned with– bundle up folks, because there’s a new festival to save up for!",articles11,[]
"Flume is back! After a huge tour following his record-smashing sophomore album , Australian Harley Streten took some time off to relax and write more music.According to his documentary “When Everything Was New”, Flume works best the more uncomfortable and unsuitable the conditions are to write music. Eschewing the studio in favour of the back of car, a beach, or anywhere that inspires creativity, Harley creates the most unique sounding electronic music of the decade.Details are limited to the Instagram post from Flume’s official Instagram, just a picture, title and release date.

"In this day and age, there aren’t many musicians that have succeeded both in the new age of technology and the old. Above & Beyond’s own Tony McGuiness is one of the lucky ones to have been a trail blazer in both the 2000’s and the 2010’s. Ahead of Miami Music Week, Tony sat down with Miami New Times to discuss the changing ways we discover music.Our world today provides us with the easiest and most convenient avenues to discover and listen to music. We have multiple streaming services, music discovery apps, and outlets to share what we’ve found… all right at our finger tips. This wasn’t so a decade ago, as Tony explains.“It used to be the lack of availability of music made it more valued. You’d go to a club and hear a song, and you’d have to track it down. Then you’d spend weeks getting to know it. An album was valuable because you spent money on it. People’s record collections were a display of their soul.”Compare that to now, we can get music almost instantaneously. All we need to do is Shazam a song as soon as we hear it, and it gets automatically downloaded into your iTunes library. Tony continued to explain that in today’s streaming age, “music has become like electricity or water. There’s no less effort in creation, but in consumption it just comes out.” This also adds an unfair amount of pressure on producers. In order to keep up with the rapid pace of consumption, artists have to continuously put out music to satisfy fans’ craving and this could compromise their creativity and quality of production.But the most profound comment from McGuinness came when he spoke about A&B and Anjunabeats’ fans. He explained that their fans are kind, loving, and share the same love for music. And from this, it’s ok to take in the moment with one another rather than trap yourself in social media.“Before we retreat to our social media world, it’s a wonderful surprise to engage with people who like the same things.”Try and think back to a time when you didn’t have a smart phone. All you needed to do was take in the moment with others around you. If you can remember doing this, then you’ll fully understand what Tony is saying. You’ll realize how special it is to share moments with others instead of being alone in your phone.As Miami Music Week quickly approaches, I want to challenge you all to keep your phones in your pockets as much as possible. Every party will supply you with memories and friends you’ll have for a lifetime, so make sure to stay in the moment for them. Focus on that rather than how many likes you get.If you want to read the full Miami New Times article, you can do so here.

"It’s exactly two weeks until Ultra Miami. Ever since they announced the location change, it seems like the festival has had to jump over hurdle after hurdle. This week, Miami Waterkeeper executive director Rachel Silverstein wrote to Ultra organizers, calling them out for not doing enough. She believes the noise levels will greatly impact the island’s marine life.Ultra claims they have taken measures to develop a sustainable and wildlife-friendly festival. In fact, their sustainable plan can be found on their website. According to Silverstein’s letter, however, the main issue is beyond pollution.Scientists from the University of Miami have labs based on Virginia Key Island.  Many are concerned about the effects the noise levels will have on the fish, manatees, crocodiles, and other marine animals currently residing on the island.Back in 2016, the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) adopted a ten-year plan in order to manage and control rising noise levels in the US called the Ocean Noise Strategy RoadmapVirginia Key serves as a sanctuary for marine wildlife. The conservation project is only now recovering from Irma, the massive 2017 hurricane. Conservationists are concerned it may damage the balance and cause many of the animals to flee for good.Part of Ultra’s states that they have conducted a “noise impact analysis.” It also states that noise mitigation features will be incorporated at certain stages to reduce noise levels transmitted to neighboring facilities and wildlife. Parking will also be limited to a select few, including the vendors, the disabled and certain VIP attendees.Ultra released this statement in response to Silverstein’s letter.“We have engaged one of the most highly regarded environmental consulting firms with decades of experience in order to fully address any and all species and habitat issues native to Virginia Key.” Silverstein rebutted that Ultra’s initiative is “inadequate.”Does this mean Ultra is canceled? Most likely not. It does raise a point about the harmful effects festivals may have on the environment, particularly on islands. A report from YEDM showed an example of the negative effects noise poses to marine life.Days after Bassnectar‘s Deja Voom festival in Mexico, one of the dolphins died in the care of the resort’s facilities. Though it is our opinion that this blame should not fall on the artist’s shoulders, having the artist speak up against possible animal cruelty or environmental danger could be a way to get the organizers to listen.Whether you care about the environment or not, the least we can all do is be aware of the issues. In the end, it affects us all.What do you think? Sources: Miami New Times. Miami Herald.",articles11,"['Silverstein', 'RoadmapVirginia Key', 'Irma', 'Parking', '“We']"

Spotify and Apple Music are in a serious battle for music streaming supremacy. Recently, Spotify added new privileges specifically for Samsung users, in an attempt to come out ahead. But they still lag behind in the iPhone market. One reason for that is due to the Apple App store.According to Spotify’s founder, Daniel Ek, the Apple App Store requires Spotify and other digital services to pay 30 percent tax on items that are purchased through Apple’s payment system. This includes upgrading to Spotify Premium. “If we pay this tax,” Ek said, “it would force us to artificially inflate the price of our premium membership well above the price of Apple Music. And to keep our price competitive for our customers, that isn’t something we can do.”There also seems to be a bit of a double standard. Apps such as Uber are not affected by this tax. This makes it seem like Apple is picking and choosing who they want to charge. Spotify has filed an official claim with the European Commission to fight this tax.Ek did stress that this isn’t a “Spotify-versus-Apple issue” but rather a “Competition on the merits” but…let’s be honest here, it also is very much a Spotify-versus-Apple issue.",articles11,"['Spotify', 'Spotify', 'Samsung', 'Spotify', 'Uber', 'Apple', 'Spotify']"

What is surprising is the amount of backlash he has received from fans on his  album and tour. And yet, Petulla has been open to the criticism and earlier this month decided to adjust some aspects of his live show.been thinking about the criticism of the visceral tour so far and have started to adjust a lot of shit in the performanceit doesn’t make sense for me to expect everyone from previous shows to be 100% down w the new stuffima make this super special thanks for the pointers 😊— 𝕲𝖊𝖙𝖙𝖊𝖗 (@GetterOfficial) March 7, 2019This situation brings up a larger issue within music culture.Being a “fan since day one” doesn’t mean you own the artist. In fact, if you claim to be a die-hard fan since the beginning of the artist’s career then by default you should know that they are embarking on a journey of musical discovery. It’s okay to love the origins but a lot of you still need to learn how to respect the development. This is their career. Sure, criticism is a part of any job, and we need it in order to grow and learn. There is a difference between constructive criticism and being an asshole.Getter, don’t stop what you’re doing.

"Today was the latest, and probably last attempt for bitter third parties to stop Ultra Music Festival from taking place in 2 weeks at Miami’s Virginia Key. After what turned out to be a nail-biting 2+ hours, Judge Ruiz in Miami has ruled that neither Brickell Homeowners Association nor Mullin have standing to bring an action to void the license agreement between Miami and Ultra. So let’s break it down a bit.This latest lawsuit is brought by Brickell Homeowners Association and an individual claiming that Miami is violating its charter. They claim it violated its charter by allowing Ultra a license to hold the festival where a lease should be required. If a lease is required, competitive bidding would have to be held, which it was not in this case.First off the Judge was clear in ruling that the Brickell Homeowners Association did not have standing to bring this motion for a temporary injunction. However the question became dicier for the individual, Mullin. There was a long discussion about licenses vs leases and what injury Mullin suffered. Mullin’s attorney said the injury was simply Miami’s violation of its charter.Things got tense enough to the point where Ultra’s attorneys argued that granting the injunction cause significant harm at the 11th hour right before people boarded flights to Miami, since it would cancel the festival.In the end, the Judge found that Miami’s charter is silent on whether injury must be suffered by an individual to bring an action such as this, but he did not rule as to whether one is required or not. The attorney trying to stop Ultra said he would find another Plaintiff who will allege a true injury in the event the Court ruled in favor of Miami, and this is likely to be appealed. However, Ultra is once again victorious and will continue site build out for Virginia Key.

"If you’re not in the French Alps at Tomorrowland Winter (TLW) right now, you’re missing history in the making. It may be dead cold up there but, guaranteed this party is as hot as it gets. How a festival at a ski resort could be this hot is a mystery, but the footage is straight fire! To prove it, ID&T has already loaded up its live sets for your viewing pleasure.TLW like any major live event has experienced its issues. A major snowstorm led to some patrons needing evacuation. Just a week before the event, concerns about tent structures brought chills to some expectations. Fortunately, the production carried on and as expected, the results have been fantastic.Armin van Buuren – OrangerieThe live set footage coming out of the Alpe d’Huez resort is superb and just reminds us all how cold the Tomorrowland production is. They’ve definitely set the bar for what a festival can be and hopefully have started a trend going forward. Tune into the live feeds today as Lost Frequencies, Martin Garrix, and Steve Aoki are slated to perform.

"It’s been two years since Harley released any new music. However, last April the future bass juggernaut announced the release of two documentaries that would cover his life as a DJ  and creative process as a producer. Unfortunately, the content was exclusive to Apple so only iTunes users could get their hands on it. Thankfully, Flume was gracious enough to share the films with the world.The documentary definitely reaches back into the earlier years of Flume’s life. It goes back to when he was a kid and highlights every step he took to get where he is today. For example, his parents are interviewed in the film attempting to explain how their son’s musicality developed over time. It all helps to develop a great story and is easily something any artist can relate to.Arguably the most interesting thing about the film is that it chronicles his career from its infancy to where it is now. From playing small underground warehouse spots to filling up arenas, we get an in depth look at Flume’s roots. It even includes footage of Harley explaining his struggles with creativity and anxiety. Additionally, it shows how the many people around him affect him and vice-versa. Overall, the  documentary is  a great watch and is definitely something every new artist should see. Check out the four part movie below!",articles11,['Flume’s']

"After the Twitch suspension and deleting his channel, Joel ‘Deadmau5’ Zimmerman’s channel is now back up on Twitch with all the 875 videos available!Deadmau5 has a Twitch channel with a big following, having his fans tune in regularly to watch him stream making music or playing video games. Above that, his channel served as a hub hosting about 875 videos filled with musical content and game-play. The Reddit comment section seem happy, and to quote the user JillseyWillsey;All the production sessions, the (almost) masterclass in Touch Designer, the hilarious gaming moments, and Joel just talking to us off the cuff. I thought he deleted it all and I was SO sad! Can’t wait to get off work and revisit some of those rare jewels!The Twitch channel served as a home where all of his fans came together. Even though Deadmau5 mentioned finding a different platform to stream on, losing out on all the endless hours of content would be a shame. Just having his Twitch channel around with the videos can help a lot of people learn the programs he uses and his creative process, while also hosting entertaining videos.",articles11,[]
"Every year, the dance music world turns its attention to South Florida for Miami Music Week. Whether it be pool parties, club gigs, or Ultra Music Festival, each day of the week holds exclusive parties every type of dance music fan can enjoy. The Anjunabeats Pool Party in particular always seems to draw some of the most loyal and diverse crowds.This year, the annual pool party partnered up with Diskolab and boasts one of the deepest lineups of the week. However, the event will once again be switching venues, this time from the 1 Hotel to the Delano Beach Club. Below, we’ll take a deeper dive into both the lineup, and the venue.This year’s lineup boasts one of the deepest veteran and talented bills Anjuna has offered for their annual pool party. Anjuna heavy weights Andrew Bayer, Ilan Bluestone, and Jason Ross are all set to take over the stage. Legendary vets Gabriel & Dresden and Oliver Smith are set to play as well. If you’re in the mood for some smooth progressive trance, Scotland’s own GRUM will satisfy your craving. If uplifting trance is your squeeze, then Sunny Lax is the man for you.For an event that goes for eleven hours, there seems to be some unaccounted time with only seven artists currently scheduled to play. This means there will most likely be some last minute additions before the party. But overall, this lineup is fully occupied by proven producers who know how to work a crowd.As someone who has been around Miami Music Week too many times to count, I can say that a venue makes or breaks a party. This year, Anjuna takes over the Delano where the dance floor and pool are fully intertwined. With many cabanas, benches, and chairs, there’s plenty of places to put your valuables. You’ll be able to jump in the pool, and only walk a mere 10 feet to the dance floor. The Delano is easily one of the best venues in South Beach for a pool party. And with Anjuna music, the vibe will be nothing short of awesome.Before last year, the Anjuna pool party took place at the Raleigh Hotel. The hotel and venue are beautiful, but the stage and dance floor were away from the pool and under a tent. Last year, the 1 Hotel hosted the party, and the stage and dance floor were on the actual beach but with no pool. In my opinion, the Delano beats out both of these venues, and will create a true pool party atmosphere. The one X-factor though- beautiful weather. Fingers crossed for a sunny day with clear blue skies.The annual Anjunabeats Pool Party takes place on Sunday March 31 from 12pm to 11pm. If you haven’t bought tickets yet, make sure to do so, they are running out quickly.

"Talk about a blast from the past! LMFAO has finally settled their copyright lawsuit against rapper Rick Ross.In 2013, Rick Ross claimed that LMFAO stole his 2006 song, ‘Hustlin.’ He states that LMFAO’s popular song ‘Party Rock Anthem’ uses a modified version of a phrase he has copyrighted – “Everyday I’m Hustlin”. LMFAO’s lyrics are “Everyday I’m Shufflin”, and Rick Ross sued them for them without his permission.In court, US District Judge Kathleen M. Williams initially asked Ross this question:Ross responded with a resounding no. Judge Williams ultimately tossed out the lawsuit, claiming that “an altered three-word phrase wasn’t protected by copyright.” Williams ruled that Rick Ross did not have a valid copyright registration as well, dismissing the case. In 2018, Ross urged the Eleventh Circuit to reevaluate Williams’s ruling, and they ruled that Ross’s copyrights were actually valid. As a result, the lawsuit was revived.However, Judge Williams had removed Ross from the lawsuit after the first time. After that point, only copyright claims from Ross’s producers, co-writers Andrew Harr and Jermaine Jackson, could proceed to a jury trial. Ross could no longer sue LMFAO on his own basis.Allegedly, Harr & Jackson and LMFAO reached a full settlement before a jury trial could proceed. This deal arose after a nine-hour meeting. The terms of the agreement are not yet known.Digital Music News",articles11,"['Rick Ross', 'Rick Ross', 'Rick Ross', 'Rick Ross', 'Ross’s', 'Ross’s']"

"When parents say “Eat your vegetables”, now is the time to listen. Scientists recently discovered that 300g of mushrooms could cut the risk of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Let’s face it, we aren’t getting younger.People with MCI have lower levels of amino acid and therefore more inclined to natural brain decline and dementia. Symptoms include forgetfulness and reduced language and attention skills. To clarify, this condition is a set of symptoms rather than a specific disease. It is between the realm of normal age-related decline and dementia, though people with it are more likely to suffer worse mental conditions than expected. There is a silver lining though. Mushrooms contain the amino acid that the body can’t make for itself–one that is vital for people with MCI.Researchers at the National University of Singapore studied over 600 Chinese people over 60 during the course of six years. Their diet, health, and brain functions were tested after accumulated damage over time. Those that ate more than two portions of cooked mushrooms reported 50% less risk for MCI.“This correlation is surprising and encouraging”-Feng Lei, researcherIt is a common ingredient that a portion of the population may not like. However, even in small doses it can prove to be effective in helping people carry out their daily activities and improve mental abilities.Mushrooms contain ergothioneine (ET), a unique antioxidant and anti-inflammatory unable to be synthesized by humans. This is a compound low in people with MCI. Whether it be white button, oyster, shiitake, dried, canned, or golden mushrooms, they work.Mr. Feng and his team hope for more developing research on this study. Causative link or coincidence? Only time will tell. This research has been published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.",articles11,['Those']
"AirPods, the wireless earphones, perfect for the gym and travel, are under scrutiny after recent news that they may cause cancer. While there is still much more research to be done, over 200 scientist have signed a petition, warning that the tech could lead to negative health effects. The petition, signed by researchers from 42 different countries, has been directed to the United Nations and World Health Organizations.Bluetooth, the AirPods and all wireless headphones’ main source of connection to your cell phone, is the center of recent debate. Basically, Bluetooth wirelessly transmits data using electromagnetic frequency (EMF) radio waves. Researchers believe that these waves, at close proximity to one’s head, may be potentially dangerous and cancer causing.“Placement in the ear canal exposes tissues in the head to relatively high levels of radio-frequency radiation.” – Jerry PhillipsEven worse, scientist state that extended EMF exposure can cause neurological disorders and DNA damage. In all, having the set of earphones on, transmits unhealthy microwave-like waves through your brain. These warnings are similar to what we heard several years ago regarding cell phones omitting high levels of radiation.Over 45 million AirPods sold since launch and a second generation are expected this year. Additionally, wireless headphones are extremely popular because of their Bluetooth technology. More research ought to be done to understand the long term side effects with this relatively new technology. Additionally, are the hundereds of other Bluetooth products we own safe? Those trusty wired headphones might be the safer option for those concerned. ",articles11,"['Jerry PhillipsEven', 'DNA', 'Those']"

Coachella’s attorneys argued the clause helped to preserve Coachella’s uniqueness and prevents others from free-riding on Coachella’s popularity.

With the festival in doubt, a new plan had to be made fast.Spending the previous three years at Addams/Medill Park near Lake Michigan, Spring Awakening Music Festival has finally secured a new home for the 2019 edition. Its new location? The fabulous (and spacious) Poplar Creek at 59-90 Entertainment District in Hoffman Estates, IL. This northwestern Chicago suburb more than doubles the size of Addams/Medill at over 27 usable acres.SAMF will feature complimentary shuttles to the festival site, many nearby hotel accommodations, and, for the first time in its 8-year history, on-site GA Parking for festival attendees.In addition to the massively upgraded venue, SAMF announced their first six headliners. Festival favorites DJ Snake, GRiZ, Illenium, Rezz, Zedd, and Martin Garrix will grace the Solstice and Equinox stages. While over 100 artists will be announced, this is a strong start for the revamped Spring Awakening Music Festival! The full lineup hits this Friday, March 15..@djsnake, @Griz, @ILLENIUMMUSIC, @MartinGarrix, @OfficialRezz, @Zedd and over 100 more DJs join us at expansive Poplar Creek this Spring for the biggest #SAMF yet.

"While music-streaming platforms can help make or break an artist, it doesn’t come at a cheap price. Mainly, if an artist is doing relatively decent, their payouts are more or less stunted and the streaming services take most revenue for themselves. In light of this situation to protect artists, the U.S Copyright Royalty Board (CRB) has recently issued a ruling to increase songwriter payouts by 44%. Naturally in response, four music-streaming giants—Spotify, Google, Pandora and Amazon—have all stepped forward to appeal the CRB’s decision, understandably stirring great backlash for their actions. Having since come under fire, Spotify has now stepped forward with a response to the negative publicity.In a blog post, Spotify defends themselves in a FAQ-style to explain their stance, mainly outlining the flaws in CRB’s rate structure.“A key area of focus in our appeal will be the fact that the CRB’s decision makes it very difficult for music services to offer “bundles” of music and non-music offerings. This will hurt consumers who will lose access to them. These bundles are key to attracting first-time music subscribers so we can keep growing the revenue pie for everyone.”Spotify would also explain that while they support an increase in CRB rates, the backing only extends up to rates rising to 15% between now and 2022, and under the stipulation that covers the right scope of publishing rights.Subsequently, the public just isn’t quite buying the defense—some quick enough to boycott the services to hop on over to Apple Music, the only mega music streaming service not appealing the CRB. Although Spotify is correct to say that everyone wants a bigger piece of the pie, it shouldn’t come at the expense of the artist and songwriter. Hopefully, Spotify, along with these other streaming services, drop the appeal and share a little more of the pie with our starving artists.",articles11,"['Spotify', 'Spotify', 'Spotify']"
"Mad Decent Block Party is potentially on its way back! Diplo founded the Mad Decent record label in 2006 and shortly after in 2008, he formed an annual festival that would travel all over the country. What started out in Philadelphia would expand to multiple cities and even internationally. At its peak, Mad Decent was going to 14 cities around the U.S. Unfortunately, in 2018 the Block Party shrunk down to just one show.Now Diplo is looking to bring back the “Party” in a massive way. According to reports, Diplo is teaming up with SGE Entertainment to throw “The Super Mega Ultra Giant Mad Decent Block Party Festival.” This is the same company that helps produce Lost Lands and Moonrise.The festival is looking to take place on July 20-21 at the Brockton Fairgrounds in Massachusetts. However, Diplo has run into some problems. The proposal looked to produce the largest festival the city has ever seen. The initial application rose safety concerns with 37,000 people expected. Now the city wants it to be scaled back.The festival, if approved, is expected to have Major Lazer and Billie Eilish as its headliners. Performances would begin around noon and have to end at 11 PM. Public officials had this to say about the potential show:“I never seen anything as big in Brockton…I don’t know if the city can handle all that, to be honest with you.”Their initial application has been denied and they will now need to lower the number of festival attendees. Diplo and his team were looking to announce a full slate of artists on March 25th but now it looks bleak. The story is still currently developing. Stay tuned to find out if their updated application will be approved.",articles11,"['Lost Lands', 'Major Lazer', 'Billie Eilish', 'Performances']"
"If you live in the Miami area or have visited recently, then you may have experienced the new and improved Club Space. If you haven’t, fear not! Red Bull Music just released a mini documentary about the immigrants behind Space’s new owners, the Link Miami Rebels, and their impact on Miami’s thriving nightlife.Club Space has been a staple in Miami for the past twenty years. Numerous legends have played there since its inception, from Paul Van Dyk to Avicii, Skrillex and more. In 2016. Club Space was bought by three Miami nightlife natives: Davide Danese, Coloma Kaboomsky, and David Sinopoli.Initially, there was a lot of skepticism surrounding the new ownership. Many of us have experienced a beloved venue close down or change ownership, and it isn’t always for the better. This time, however, the story is different. This wasn’t a huge corporate buy-out. Danese, Kaboomsky, and Sinopoli formed the Link Miami Rebels, a collective of creative immigrants. They are a mix of first- and second-generation Americans whose families had to flee dangerous dictatorships and regimes for a chance at the American Dream. Under Link Miami Rebels, Space has transformed from a club to a community establishment.“we’re very different from each other with very different backgrounds. The events that we throw at Space and a clubs are kind of a reflection of that diversity.”Immigrants can often feel alienated and caught between two worlds, and this is why communities are so important. It’s why dance music has had such an impact in all of our lives. Next time you’re in Miami, check out Club Space. Whether you’re there for the 2am club nights, 9am yoga classes, or 2pm terrace parties, the fun never ends.

"Tomorrowland Winter is a vastly more complex operation than a normal festival, since there is an entire ski mountain to contend with. Mountains can be treacherous territory as Tomorrowland is learning today.

Many of the people had taken ski lifts up but did not plan to ski down the mountain. So, they had to be brought down the mountain in 6 bobcats, and after the attendees were rescued the artists and Tomorrowland crew were brought down.This has all just been the pre-party and Tomorrowland Winter officially kicks off tomorrow, when weather is expected to be better.

"Ultra Miami Music Festival is rapidly approaching, and the event now faces a new potential challenge. The festival takes place on Virginia Key for the first time this year. It has moved from long-time venue Bayfront Park as a result of noise levels and angry neighbors.The challenge? Rickenbacker Causeway is the only road connecting Miami and Virginia Key – posing a huge possible traffic horror. Government and festival officials estimate they will need to transport over 60,000 people off Virginia Key each evening when the festival concludes. The traffic management plan is not officially approved, but there is a portion of the plan that is highly likely to be implemented.As of right now, the plan for transporting festival-goers in and out of the venue is by using a massive rotation of ferries and shuttle buses. Once these modes of transportation take attendees back to the mainland, they can take mass transit or ridesharing cars. More importantly, there will be little to no parking for festival attendees on the island – with the exception of attendees requiring special accommodations, limited VIP ticket holders, and staff/vendors. Ultra’s spokesman and security chief Ray Martinez announced,The biggest concern of festival organizers is not necessarily people coming into the festival. Rather, they worry about attendees leaving the event all at once, at the end of the evening. A proposed option is to prohibit ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft from entering the island. With thousands of cars called at the same time, it will be a traffic nightmare. This ban is not yet official, but Uber has already made it clear that it is reluctant to send drivers to the venue because of the area’s “logistical challenges”.As of right now, Ultra has obtained over 200 buses to move attendees to and from the venue. They will pick up/drop off from three locations on the mainland. These locations include the Old Miami Herald site, American Airlines Arena and Vizcaya Museum and Gardens. In addition, Ultra will also have 24-hour control of Miami-Dade County’s Metrorail train. According to Ray Martinez,“The exact number of bus shuttles utilized from the transit hubs is still being determined… for the comfort, safety and convenience of our patrons, our shuttle bus service will include large 55- passenger coach buses with restrooms, air-conditioning, comfortable seating and on-board wi-fi.”The reality of these transportation issues is that as of right now, they can only be estimated and assumed. Key Biscayne Police Chief Charles Press stated,Moving the festival to this venue is a trial of the unknown in itself. It has been a bumpy road for Ultra leading up to their festival. From receiving backlash & complaints, and even facing a lawsuit from a competing festival, Ultra has pushed on. This week, the City of Miami was also sued by the Brickell Homeowners Association for allowing Ultra on Virginia Key. This year, Miami commissioners unanimously rejected the contract for Ultra to remain in downtown Miami. The festival spent 18 years at this previous venue.Ultra Miami kicks off on Friday, March 29.

"The debate over whether or not MDMA is dangerous has been going on for decades. It has gone as far as whether it should be legalized, or if there should be pill testing centers at festivals. It has been looked down upon by society due to the numerous deaths the drug has caused. But on the other side, recent studies have shown MDMA may actually have positive medical effects. Specialist GP David Charles Thomas weighed in on the debate that is central to so many countries.According to the doctor, the drug is “not that dangerous” when taken in “pure form.” The real danger lies in the illegal market that the drug functions in. People don’t know what they are taking and its almost impossible to tell. He said all this on a podcast called “Triggered.” The GP went into how the drug causes self-excitement but at the same time limits an individuals ability to self-regulate their temperature.“It can make them feel like they have a lot more energy, but it also decouples their temperature regulation and their perception to the extent of any warning signs.”The podcast centralized around the debate over pill testing in Australia, something not really debated here in the states. There have been many deaths at festivals over the past two years and the public wants some form of pill testing. As the debate rages on some parties have discussed the potential for passing a bill for testing. However, it would most likely need to be seen that the drug has positive medical uses. Similar to how marijuana has become legal.At the end of the day, even if bills like this don’t pass, people should still be testing their pills at home. It is better to be safe and remember to stay hydrated. ",articles11,"['MDMA', '“It']"

I need to throw down the best set possible.”One year later, Shaq is ready to take it to the next level and even has artists in mind to collaborate with.  “I’m working on some music with Diplo at the moment and would love to get in the studio with him and Skrillex soon”, he told Page Six. In the interview, Shaq  commented that he really looked up to Diplo and Skrillex and was serious with his work.With his athletic background, we know Shaq wants nothing but the best. Combined with his competitive attitude, there’s no telling how far the giant can and will go. When someone says he can’t do something, you know he’s going to prove them wrong. Right now, his production is still in the beginning stages but he’s been spending more time practicing and understanding his style. “I have been spending a lot more time in the studio and just love to mess around making music”.It would definitely be interesting to see what Diplo, Skrillex, and Shaq could come up with in the studio.

Bestival Festival 2019 will not be taking place this year, according to Dorset Police. The news comes after the festival made headlines regarding a trial for a festival attendee’s drug related deathback in 2017.Dorset Police have revealed that the new event owners stated that it won’t be taking place. A spokesperson has stated, ‘Some time ago, we were informed by the new event owners that there are no plans to run a Bestival 2019 event.The police have also stated,‘The payment of our 2018 policing services invoice, totaling 141,176, to cover our policing of both Camp Bestival and Bestival is still outstanding and we’ve not received any full or part payment toward this’There have been no official announcements in response from the festival organizers. However, according to a tweet from Bestival co-founder Rob da Bank, the statements by the police may not be true.there are some very odd and frankly completely fabricated and totally untrue stories circulating right now …watch this space— Rob da Bank (@RobdaBank) March 6, 2019Although a bit vague, it seems like there may be miscommunications from both parties.Camp Bestival, the sister festival to Bestival, will still be taking place this year at the Lulworth Castle in Dorset.",articles11,"['Bestival', 'Bestival']"

"– Yes, that’s true! There’s about 6 collaborations in there with some of my own artists that I manage, as well as some other guys that I think we could do something amazing together, then there’s several originals, remixes, and then 2 other remixes from 2 artists that I manage, fingers crossed that I get a good reaction from the crowd!– I would love the opportunity to release a full album, it’s something I think I need to speak with Armada but it’s not being tabled at the moment, so I’m releasing, well, I’ve got lots of release material, but we are releasing on a schedule, every 6 to 7 weeks there’s a new release, there was one yesterday, we’ve released ‘Aftermath’, and then at the end of the month there’s another really special remix, from one of my favorite trance tracks, the artist actually asked me personally to remix it for him and I actually met him for the first time tonight, here! Yeah, I’m still trying to absorb everything that’s going on, it’s quite surreal to be at A State Of Trance!– I still have to pinch myself on a daily basis like, “is this really happening?”, because you spend years, and years, and years, looking up to these guys and then, to even speak to them to me, it gets my adrenaline going, but then I try to actually converse with them at a friendship level, and then to play with them on stage, and then to look at them like equals, we can have a nice conversation, and they know who I am, it’s crazy! It’s something I’ve never thought it would actually happen, I’ve been doing this for 15 years now and before ‘Fallout’ was released in 2017 I was ready to walk away from the music business so I just had my daughter, my fiancée and I are planning to get married and buy a house, and then this happened and now we’re still working on how everything’s going to fit, and then I still work my day job, I now run an artist agency, as well as a DJ, and I have no sleep!– I’ve got a rest planned next weekend, actually! My fiancée, my daughter and I are going away for the weekend, just in the UK! Phone’s going off, no e-mails! Because this weekend is the launch of pretty much my whole tour schedule! So next weekend’s free, then after that I’m not going to get to see them as much as I do. I still work a day job so I’ve got to be very careful with my holiday allocation, they don’t understand DJing, a DJ to these guys while at work it’s that of the 60’s, you introduce the track and then you press play and pause. They don’t understand the concept of events like these. Me planning an event like this one, for them, it doesn’t add up!– Everybody has that one DJ that pulls him into the industry. I didn’t even realize I was listening to trance music when I was listening to him: Tiësto. It was his older trance stuff that got me into it. I didn’t even know what I was listening to! I kind of remember that I stumbled across his music, but the way he structured his sets, everything, all of it, was a journey from start to finish, you could see him at a 1-hour set, 2-hour set, 6-hour set, you would always feel completely mind-blown after you’ve seen him, that is ingraining to me, the way I structure my sets and especially my musical style, well, you just listen to it! It speaks for itself at the end of the day. A lot of people keep asking me: “do you think he’s going to come back, do you think he’ll do some trance here and there”? Hopefully one day, I’d love to even, it never happened, but to do a collaboration or just to meet him actually! It would be so cool!– Whoops! I don’t follow football! I used to play rugby when I was a lot younger, and then I’ve always been into kickboxing, karate, muay-thai, football was one my weakest things at school, I could never run a straight line, could never kick a ball!",articles11,['– Yes']
"There are a lot of hardworking people in the music industry. There are individuals who pour their heart and soul into creating a better scene for the fans. There are people who dedicate themselves night and day to their craft because they love it so much. There are also opportunists who love to capitalize on the hard work of those around them. Daniel Steelman is the representation of this side of the electronic music industry. He, his company Fine Spun and partner Wes Kane, are well known in the Birmingham scene for calling the cops on parties happening the same night as their own and sending personal messages to other people’s employers in order to get them in trouble, among other questionable business tactics. This morning Steelman sent EDMTunes a copy of his lawyer’s letter to Glen Goodhand, owner of Imagine Music Festival, in an attempt to use our reputation in the media to gain some sort of public support for himself.This move is anything but professional. In an email titled “Biggest EDM story of the year about to break!” Daniel sent the EDMTunes staff a copy of what amounts to an extortion letter. In the text of the letter, his lawyer claims that Steelman has some sort of right to or ownership of the Imagine brand, even though he has not been involved in the project since it moved from Birmingham to Atlanta over 6 years ago. The fact that he is making this move after 5 successful years of growth without him paints a clear picture of an opportunistic mindset. This not only represents Daniel Steelman’s thinking that he deserves things he did not work for, but also shows an underhanded method to manipulate the media and our readership to sympathize without presenting any credible side of the story.You can read the exact wording of the letter below and see the lack of substance in his actions. Although the letter claims that Steelman “would prefer to resolve these issues surrounding the festival on an amicable basis,” he had no problem sending this email off to the press in order to gain some sort of public support for his side. Although the letter originated from the legal offices of Trucks and Trucks, it’s hard to take anything seriously when there is a laughing star emoji superimposed over the date on a legal document. Steelman’s actions to cover up the letter’s issue date and obscure important information point towards a personal agenda that seems anything but honest about the matter at hand.Steelman also sent an unprompted, semi-threatening Facebook message to local Birmingham production company Heady.Made.Weird, asking to “meet up” for what could only be some sort of confrontation. You can see the message in the post below. He also threatened event producer Seth Seymour in a much less veiled way, which has also been included.We’re not sure if Steelman’s lawyer knows about this email to the press or the veiled threats to local production companies. Although we reached out to Michael Trucks for comments on the matter, we have not yet received any response. What we do know is that both of these actions represent a way of thinking that is unwelcome in the electronic music world. With this email Steelman is not only trying to extort Imagine Music Festival, but also attempting to use EDMTunes to spin his story and use our reputation to back his personal agenda.You can check out the original email from Daniel Steelman below, as well as screenshots of the threats against the Heady.Made.Weird group and Seth Seymour. We don’t know what’s going on in Steelman’s head, but we do know there is no place for people like him in a world where we strive for happy, open relationships with our fellow music lovers.",articles11,['Daniel Steelman’s']

It’s been 50 years since the original Woodstock festival. For this golden anniversary, the 1969 Woodstock Co-Producer and Co-Founder, Michael Lang, has secured top headliners for the three-day festival. The festival, which is to take place from August 16th to the 18th in Watkins Glen, New York, will be titled Woodstock 50.In a statement with BillboardLang announced that there will be over 80 artists at this event. Although the full lineup has not been released, organizers have confirmed these headliners: Santana, Chance the Rapper, Dead and Company, The Killers, and Imagine Dragons. There are also rumors circulating about Miley Cyrus, Halsey, Jay-Z, and The Black Keys joining the lineup. The event is expected to draw about 100,000 people. Unfortunately, the original festival grounds, Bethel Woods, is not big enough to host an event this size. Instead, Woodstock 50 will take place an hour and a half away at the Watkins Glen International Speedway. This new location, however, will not change the atmosphere of the festival. When Lang first announced Woodstock 50, he had this to say about his decision to commemorate the festival:“The original festival in ’69 was a reaction by the youth of the time to the causes we felt compelled to fight for – civil rights, women’s rights, and the antiwar movement, and it gave way to our mission to share peace, love and music. Today, we’re experiencing similar disconnects in our country, and one thing we’ve learned is that music has the power to bring people together. So, it’s time to bring the Woodstock spirit back, get involved and make our voices heard.”As we move closer to the 50th-anniversary date, we can see the influence Woodstock has had into the modern-day festival. It wouldn’t be surprising if they include electronic artists into this lineup since EDM culture is all about spreading love and peace as well. We’re beyond excited to see who joins this iconic event.",articles11,"['Chance the Rapper', 'Dead', 'Company', 'The Killers', 'Jay-Z', 'The Black Keys', '–', 'Today']"

"It’s officially March and Ultra Music Festival is right around the corner. Ultra’s new location at Virginia Key is finally coming to fruition, and Rapture has been vanquished. That hasn’t stopped the crazies from trying to stop Ultra. Wednesday evening, a “Miami Attorney” by the name of David Winkler sent an email blast to blogs claiming that he had filed an Emergency lawsuit against the City of Miami to stop Ultra. He stated in his email:It’s unclear who this attorney is, but a Google search shows that he also inserted himself into David Beckham’s plans to build a soccer stadium in Miami. Apparently he played a role in stopping or delaying the project with two lawsuits against Miami over the past few months. In any case, the State Court lawsuit claims to be by the Brickell Homeowners Association and Christopher Mullin against Miami.The lawsuit asks for Emergency Declaratory Relief to declare that Miami had no right to suspend competitive bidding over the Virginia Key space to allow Ultra to take place there. The lawsuit argues that the license granted to Ultra for use of Virginia Key and the Flex Park is actually a lease, and a lease requires competitive bidding process before it can given out. The lawsuit demands that the Court force Miami to apply competitive bidding to the site, which would therefore nullify the license agreement Ultra has.Take this all with a HUGE gain of salt. David J. Winkler lists an email address for a seemingly non-existent law firm. It remains to be seen how serious this is, but it’s unlikely to get in the way of Ultra at this point. The Complaint mostly rehashes arguments that were made by Rapture and tossed out. Despite all of this David Winkler remains defiant, responding to email inquiry by stating:I am going to be scheduling an emergency hearing to have the judge nullify the License Agreement and make the City go through the legal process required by its charter.You can read the Complaint below and stay tuned for updates.",articles11,"['Emergency Declaratory Relief', 'Virginia Key']"
"Ketamine, Special K, K, Kit Kat–you know it as the “party drug”. Did you know that it can be reduced to its chemical cousin called esketamine? The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has just approved Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc.‘s nasal spray called Spravato. Containing the compound, it is the newest treatment for depression.Spravato is a nasal spray that may be recommended for patients with treatment-resistant depression. For anyone that has a history of depression with two failed successes on medication, here is their alternative. You no longer need prescribed oral antidepressants (at the physician’s discretion), you can take this as a direct supplement.Prescribers recommend usage once a week or once every other week. Depending on the severity of depression in the patient, this spray must be administered inside a doctor’s office. Self-administration under a health care provider’s supervision is the other option. Please note that the spray cannot be taken home. While these rules seem stringent, it’s for the safety of its potential abuse and side effects.Here are the details you’ve been waiting for. Feelings of dizziness, nausea, vertigo, anxiety, lethargy may arise. An increase in blood pressure, vomiting, feeling drunk, or decreased sensitivity may also occur. Dissociation–a feeling of being temporarily ‘disconnected’ from your mind and body–is not uncommon. This is the typical side effect of ketamine’s regular use.Want to know more about the chemical cousin compound? According to the FDA’s press release, esketamine is the s-enantiomer of ketamine. This is the first FDA approval of its kind for any use and marks new approaches in treating serious mood problems.With current depression treatments proving ineffective in 30 – 40 percent of cases, this latest drug trial seems innovative and promising.Read the full press release via FDA here.",articles11,"['Special K', 'Kit Kat–', '–', 'ketamine’s']"

"The rain in San Diego didn’t stop CRSSD from hosting their first event of the year. The two-day, packed house and techno festival was full of festivities with outstanding performances from Odesza, Whethan, and more. Throughout the two days, attendees were able to crack open a beer and dance the day away across the San Diego waterfront.This year, CRSSD had a massive line up featuring a diverse amount of artists such as Lane 8, Pan-Pot, Petit Biscuit, and more. The entire event took place at their well-known home at the Waterfront Park in the heart of Downtown San Diego. Saturday, the rain didn’t stop fans from moving and grooving to their favorite artists. Armand Van Helden and Petit Biscuit stole the show. Armand Van Helden threw down a massive set at The Palms stage where everyone was lost in the music. Petit Biscuit truly took over the Ocean View stage by performing his heart out for another memorable appearance in San Diego. CRSSD absolutely did everything they can this year to kick their festival season off to a good start.The music wasn’t the only appealing attraction at the festival. The food that was displayed was absolutely amazing. CRSSD went above and beyond with food choices that would make festival attendee’s mouths water instantly. They had anything from Korean BBQ to deep-fried Oreos to satisfy a long lasted sweet craving. CRSSD also had their own bar with their own personalized mixed drinks that were perfect for a break from dancing.Two hours after the festival started on Sunday afternoon, Luttrell brought the heat to The Palms stage as the sun was starting to peak its way out of the clouds. His groovy performance set the mood for nothing but good vibes to kick off the second day of the festival. The crowd had nothing but beautiful energy to bring to the dance floor as Luttrell showed off his pure talent on the decks.As the night went on, House and Techno duo, Pan-Pot showed San Diego the true roots of House music. Although it started to sprinkle during their set, the crowd was too hypnotized by the music to care about the weather. Whethan also has been exploring different sounds within his music and he really proved it during his performance at CRSSD. The young artist went out of his comfort zone and incorporated his style into hard-hitting beats that got an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the crowd.As the festival came to an end, Odesza, of course, packed the Ocean View stage and showed off their beautiful production to end the festival on the best note possible. Being tried didn’t stop the crowd from singing loud and proud to their favorite Odesza classics. It is no surprise that Odesza had an outstanding performance once again.All in all – CRSSD can check off another successful festival of their list. Act fast and already start to prepare for their fall festival because it will only get better from here for the CRSSD team. We can’t wait to see what they bring to the table in the fall!",articles11,"['Pan-Pot', 'Petit Biscuit', 'Petit Biscuit', 'Petit Biscuit', 'Pan-Pot', 'Whethan']"

And this year is no exception with Swedish House Mafia set to perform at the 2019 Singapore Grand Prix before the Friday practice sessions. The Swedes also performed at the 2013 edition of the Singapore Grand Prix during their ‘One Last Tour’. They join Cardi B, Muse, RHCP, Fatboy Slim & Hanz Zimmer as part of a stellar lineup.This announcement is rather good news for all the people who still have their hopes up for a full-blown world tour. However, there is still no confirmation of the latter. And with previously announced shows being largely constricted to Europe & the States, the Singapore GP (and Ultra Korea for that matter) are a blessed sigh of relief for all the Swedish House Mafia fans this side of the globe.The Singapore Grand Prix is the 15th race in the F1 Calendar & is an absolutely spectacular night time street circuit race.

"One thing that even some of the most well-known DJs may never experience is playing for eight hours straight. But Patrice Baumel is no stranger to the extended set format. Ahead of his March 8all-night gig at club Shelter in Amsterdam, the German born producer let his fans in on a few tips for his long hauls in the DJ booth.Some of the tips are pretty obvious. Get lots of sleep beforehand. Drink water, not booze. But there are others that would be great habits to pick up for any set. Baumel goes into the night “without a set plan but flow[s] with what the dancefloor needs”. Any good disc jockey knows that reading the audience is a key part of playing an excellent set, so having a prepared set list is a big no no. Another often overlooked aspect of being in the booth is the volume of the monitors. Patrice touches on this, paying “extra attention to the low monitor and headphone levels” as well as choosing “potential b2b partners carefully”. If you ruin your ears you won’t be much of a DJ for long. And for those long, extended sets, some “bananas, a shot of espresso or a Club Mate” will give you that extra bit of energy to keep the vibe going.If you’re in the club behind the decks, some of these tips may already be in your playbook. And even if you don’t DJ, you can always apply them to your own work!

"The Music Industry is one of the least understood industries around, and from the looks of things, it might just be by design. For the latest example of this, look no further than the über-famous, Kanye West. In recent documents made public by The HollywoodReporter about his contract with EMI, it is stated that Kanye is unable to take a break from music, at all. Another stipulation states that he is required to stay actively involved in writing, recording, and producing.This ongoing legal battle stems from West‘s desire for “freedom from his publishing and recording contracts”. In court, West has cited the California Labor Code section 2855, a.k.a. the De Havilland Law. This code, in layman’s terms, states that:“personal service contracts are limited to no more than seven calendar years in length.”In the case of Kanye West, this places the end of his seven-year agreement at around 2010, meaning he got into the contract in, or around 2003, which is when he began recording ‘‘.West‘s EMI publishing contract, which is what is being heavily contested, states that he will:“remain actively involved in writing, recording and producing Compositions and Major Label Albums, as Your principle occupation.” In addition, he must:“at no time during the Term” initiate a retirement from those occupations or take an extended hiatus in which he’s not actively carrying them out.”If you’re interested in checking out Kanye’s contract, you can do so here. It will be interesting to see what comes from this, hopefully, West will make it out alright.",articles11,"['Music Industry', 'Kanye West', 'Kanye West', 'Kanye’s']"

"Rolling Loud is at it again with the EDM hate train. As a large festival that focuses mainly on Hip-Hop music, it’s understandable to want to only book as many Hip-Hop artists as possible. However, it’s one thing to go on Twitter to take shots at the EDM genre for some publicity. As a response to an EDM fan, Rolling Loud tweeted this:Do people really go to raves to hear the same beat for 10 hours— Rolling Loud (@RollingLoud) March 3, 2019Nevertheless, this caused a myriad of responses from outraged EDM fans. Trying to defend EDM fans pointed out as many flaws with Hip-Hop artists as they could and they did not hold back. Shots ranging from set times and arrival times, to how they only say a few words on the mic while the record version plays most of the song. Rolling Loud quickly learned that fans of EDM are not going to back down from a fight.This is nothing new as for years now the festival has done this before. Back in 2017, they tweeted this to again spark rage induced EDM fans to react and give the festival more attention. In the past, they tried to make amends by saying that EDM wasn’t for their festival last year. Clearly, their tactics have changed and are now fully against having any DJ’s attend the event. It’s funny to see any festival would hate on another genre especially one who bases their business model on their enemy’s biggest festival. Last but not least, Insomniac owns Rolling Loud.

"Many famous DJs have created side projects with other producers to release new music. Diplo has Major Lazer and Silk City. Probably the most famous one of them all, Swedish House Mafia, is of course back this year. Its been almost a year since Martin Garrix and Maejor released new music on their AREA21 project.Well, the long wait for “Music produced on a spaceship” should be over soon. On AREA21’s Facebook, they posted a title of the soon to be released track ‘Help.’ It’s clear that the whole point of the Alias is for Martin to release music that has a different sound than his usual one.AREA21 broke into the scene when Garrix dropped some new tracks at Ultra Miami 2016. The music is hip-hop infused and we can expect to hear more of this at his sets as festival season is right around the corner. The duo has already released 5 singles. This sixth should be dropping this week or the next on Garrix’s label STMPD RCRDS. ",articles11,"['Major Lazer', 'Martin Garrix']"
"While we probably learned everything we need to know from the critically-acclaimed and highly accurate DJ film “We Are Your Friends,” Netflix has decided to provide their own take on the profession. A new Netflix DJ show, “Turn Up Charlie,” is set to premiere on March 15 via our favorite streaming portal. The show stars Idris Elba (a very real and respected DJ in his own right), Piper Perabo (Coyote Ugly, Covert Affairs) and J.J. Feild (Captain America, TURN).The official trailer was released this week, and in all honesty, it looks pretty funny. Elba plays a down-and-out DJ who is trying to get his career back on track. He runs into his best friend (Feild), who offers him a job working with his famous DJ wife (Perabo). Kicker is – it isn’t making music – the job is as a babysitter for her 11-year old daughter (Frankie Hervey).It appears to be a comedic take on the struggles DJs face and the crap they have to wade through. As a bonus, the babysitter angle is a funny one – the relationship between Elba and Hervey appears to be the main plot-driver here. With the TV-MA tag, there are sure to be lots of foul language and compromising situations. In all, some low-key star-power with decently comedic writing looks to be a winning combination.Check out the full trailer for the new Netflix DJ show “Turn Up Charlie” below!",articles11,"['Netflix', '–']"

"Back in January, popular nightclub, Opera Atlanta, went under scrutiny after Jasmine Eiland recorded her own apparent rape on Facebook Live. Since then, the perpetrator, 34 year-old Dominique Williams, has been charged with aggravated sodomy. Eiland has also moved forward to officially file a lawsuit against Opera. It has been uncovered that in the past two years, she is one of four alleged victims to report sexual assault at Opera.According to police reports, incidents date back as early as March 2017. One woman claimed several men had fondled her while she was unconscious. In November 2017, another female came forward reporting a man attempted to force himself on her after robbing her. Events take a similar tone in December of the same year, when a third woman alleges a man forced her to perform oral sex on him before having sex with her against her will.Opera has been quick to point out that the club has been under new management since October of last year. This perhaps suggests that Eiland’s case is that of an isolated event. Eiland’s legal team have set forth the suit claiming the club was short staffed that night with inadequate security. In response, Opera intends to fight against Eiland’s lawsuit, asserting that the safety of guests is always their main priority.It’s hard to control the type people who go out to events. Regardless of this being a reflection of the true culture of Opera’s crowd or not, we’ve all encountered a few bad apples. However, staff and security being readily available for support has always come a long way.No amount has been disclosed yet on how much Eiland wishes to seek for restitution. Irrespective, we all hope that Opera has undergone some major restructuring to ensure such atrocity never happens again.",articles11,[]
"Around 9 pm, Deadmau5 was gearing to be on stage for his set with Rinzen. Or, so he thought. The dates of the show aren’t consecutive being, 2/26 and 2/28. This is rather unusual so it’s easy to see why he may have gotten things mixed up. On top of that, he had just come off of what he described as a sick show. He was able to do a full test drive of Cube 3.0 including his Microsoft Surface custom control software. Sounds like everything will be dialed in perfectly by the time he makes it to Ultra Music Festival.So, around 10 pm last night he went to Reddit to vent his frustrations which gave us this glorious post. In any event, it sounds like Deadmau5 is 100% locked in on delivering a phenomenal Cube 3.0 set for his fans. That is great news no matter which day he’ll actually be in your town.Grab your tickets to Deadmau5′ next show here!",articles11,"['Rinzen', 'Reddit', 'Deadmau5', 'Deadmau5′']"
"Sometimes, we can’t help but wonder: “ Armin van Buuren Well, we still don’t have an answer for that, but we are certainly happy that it’s working this way. Last weekend, to celebrate the 900 episodes of his radio show A State Of Trance, Armin threw a mega-festival without precedents: ASOT 900. EDMTunes was lucky enough to be a part of the festivities, and we are here to tell you everything about it!With a record-breaking attendance of 35,000 festivalgoers from 161 nationalities, ASOT 900 has been, by far, the biggest edition of an ASOT festival. The Utrecht venue hosted 5 different stages with different trance styles to fit everyone’s taste. Some of the artists on the bill included Vini Vici, MaRLo, Estiva, Giuseppe Ottaviani, Allen Watts, Whitenoise, Dezza, Ruben de Ronde, Luke Bond and more. But the festival wouldn’t have been complete without some fantastic perks and surprises that happened through the night:Armin playing 3 different sets during the night: This is none other than Armin’s own festival. He conceived it from the very beginning when ASOT was only a weekly radio emission. Armin was feeling like at home, pretty much in his very own backyard, and he played 3 times: at the beginning, during the peak hour and at his signature stage, Who’s Afraid of 138?! So even if you couldn’t catch him on one set, you didn’t have to worry. You could always catch the next one.ASOT radio show live from the festival: Yes, that radio booth was everything. Just imagine yourself, enjoying the best artists in the first row of the crowd, and then going to grab a drink while watching everything that’s going on at ASOT’s radio booth. That’s what we call an immersive experience!New collaboration with Above & Beyond: And this is what we’ve all been waiting for ages! Our favorite brits and the King of Trance dropped this much-awaited new single together ‘Show Me Love‘. The Trance Family dreamed about this for a long time. And the dream became real at ASOT 900.ASOT 900 coming to the Bay Area, California: West coast Armin’s lovers, if you were disappointed that the only way to catch an ASOT 900 show was either flying to Europe or to Ultra Miami, good news have come your way. Armin announced during the festival that the ASOT 900 crew is coming to the Bay Area to keep partying like there’s no tomorrow. So if you live in San Francisco, you have been warned!Conclusion: If ASOT 900 was such an epic production, we can only imagine what ASOT 1000 is going to be. Teamed up with ALDA, the biggest electronic music promoter in the Netherlands that is now associated with Insomniac Events, Armin has the world in his hands, and the speculation for the 1000th episode is already growing. What is it going to be? We don’t know yet. But in the meantime, you can catch ASOT 900 in some of these other amazing locations!",articles11,"['Armin', 'The Utrecht', 'Vini Vici', 'Allen Watts', 'Dezza', 'Ruben de Ronde', 'Luke Bond', '!

"Unleashing his first single of 2019, Druu has teamed up with Israeli DJ and producer, GATTÜSO for an uplifting track that will light up any dance floor. The track is titled ‘Say It Right’ and features Holly T‘s memorizing voice on the vocals which perfectly compliments the energy on the track.

"The Prodigy may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but there is no denying the prolific influence the British rock-electronica band still has on dance music today. Frontman Keith Flint is a huge part of The Prodigy’s iconic image. From the devil-horn haircut to his in-your-face stage presence, the vocalist is nothing short of legendary in the scene. It is with a heavy heart that this morning we must report that Keith Flint has died by suicide.While the newer generation of electronic music fans may be in the dark about The Prodigy, their role in making dance music accessible is nothing short of profound. With chart topping singles including ‘Firestarter‘ and ‘Breathe,’ the Brits brought the underground U.K. rave scene to mainstream attention. A consistent force since the 90s, there is no separating The Prodigy from the very roots of the dance music culture we all know today.As one of the founding members, Keith brought his grit and grime and passion to every project The Prodigy involved themselves in. There is no reference to the band without recalling the intense, confrontational imagery of the infamous frontman. Found unresponsive and pronounced dead on the scene at his home in Essex, England, Flint’s death has been confirmed as a suicide by authorities and fellow founding member of the band Liam Howlett.Like Avicii, the loss of Keith to suicide will no doubt leave one of the largest holes in the dance music community that we have ever seen. Although he never gained the mainstream worldwide popularity seen by the Swedish EDM superstar, there’s no denying that electronic dance music would not be the same without them both. We may not be seeing him on the dance floor again, but we hope that wherever Keith is now he has found the inner peace that seemed to elude him throughout his life.",articles11,"['The Prodigy’s', 'The Prodigy', 'Flint’s', 'Liam Howlett']"

" Looks like Dave Winnel has created another hit with his newest track, ‘‘ Not long ago he broke through with his summer anthem ‘Achtung!.’ In 2016, his 2 million times played Spotify hit ‘Don’t Stop’ made him one of the most sought after remixers. The Armada Music stalwart hit the ground running since breaking through back in 2013 and seems to have picked up momentum along the way. This newest release, dropping today, sounds like it will continue that trend.‘Lily of the Valley,’ is on the A State Of Trance 903 mix as its, ‘Progressive Pick.’ Because of this you already know it has the backing of Armin Van Buuren. Along with that, he’s getting praise from artists like Pete Tong, Axwell, Ingrosso, Steve Angello, Tiësto, and Hardwell. With that kind of backing, you know you have to pay attention whenever Dave Winnel puts out fresh music. Obviously, Armada Music felt the same way and was quick to snatch him up.‘Lily Of The Valley’ 1/3/19 pic.twitter.com/ggp57BZYhO— Dave Winnel (@davewinnel) February 27, 2019The track is very much on par with Dave Winnel’s uplifting and organic sound. It’s not heavy on synths or sampling. Those effects play subtly and blend into the background giving the track a nice polished feel while letting the percussion be the star. He keeps the tempo moving back and forth throughout the song. Sort of like a bumble bee bouncing around a meadow moving from flower to flower. Hence the name, Lily Of The Valley.It seems as though the guys over at Armada have another hit on their hands. However, other labels out there have no need to worry. Dave Winnel’s known to spread the love around. Dropping ‘Old School’ on Axtone along with content for Size, Def Jam, and Warner proves that.

"After being featured on BBC Radio One, Dancing Astronauts and This Song Slaps (just to name a few), Hello Beddo is back with a remix EP for “Lost in August“. The remix EP brings fresh new takes on “Horizon“, “Addicted” and “Lost in August” by Luca Mar, Loveska and himself.
He upgraded the smooth and atmospheric Future Bass opus “Horizon” into a bass-heavy monster Drumstep banger. If you enjoyed the vocal and the masterful work on it in the original version, worry not, the remix kept that aspect perfectly. The blend of Dubstep and Drum and Bass on this version and its intense and energetic wobble arrangements make it a much more festival-friendly version. It also makes it a very versatile track for DJs, fitting easily in a Dubstep, Trap or Drum and Bass sets.
The contrast between the emotional melodic arrangements and the intoxicating and exhilarating drops really reminds some of the earliest (and best!) work by the likes of Seven Lions and Bassnectar.

"Kuala Lumpur’s highly anticipated dance music show “UNLIMITED“, presented by Stake of Sound, is only one day away, and we couldn’t be more excited! The event features a massive lineup that will take on Kuala Lumpur’s international scene on March 30th. Stake of Sound is ready to ignite the darker, deeper, harder and Live 2.0 journey that has been long-awaited in Malaysia! For any fans of Hard Trance music, this event can’t be missed!For Unlimited, Stake of Sound build a legendary lineup featuring local favorites like Chukiess & Whackboi and D’Jaeger to compliment the very special appearances of Giuseppe Ottaviani from Italy presenting Live 2.0, an evolution of his previous ‘Live 1.0’ performance combining all those live elements with his productions and performing new “freshly-made” tracks, Sneijder from the UK with his recent ’Afterdark’ concept for all things dark, original and dance floor orientated, Chris Schweizer from Argentina, hard trance legend Scot Project from Germany, and Shugz from the UK.Proudly organized by Stake of Sound, a collective of passionate dance music lovers coming together, this electronic dance music event will be held at KL Live, Kuala Lumpur with the first act to start at 8 pm. Electronic dance music producer Giuseppe Ottaviani will unveil the first full production of his new ‘Live 2.0’ show concept at Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC) Mexico on February 28th, 2016. The Live 2.0 concept is an evolution of his previous ‘Live 1.0’ performance concept wherein he recreated his original productions using live instruments onstage. Dance music fans can also catch Ottaviani’s Live 2.0 performance at a number of large outdoor festivals throughout 2016.Some may consider Giuseppe Ottaviani a mad scientist. Some consider him a music obsessive. One thing’s for certain: the Italian-born collaborator who is a favorite of producers the likes of Paul van Dyk cares more about music than almost any other aspect of his daily life. Giuseppe Ottaviani is the musician’s musician.To think outside-the-box as a live performer, Ottaviani decided to scale his hardware to fit squarely inside a box. Doing so ensures that each venue – be it a major outdoor festival or a darkened nightclub – will meet the exacting performance standards Ottaviani requires with virtually no changeover time and no chance for rigging errors. Said Ottaviani, “Afterwards, I can just pack up my suitcase and get on the next flight!”As a performer, Ottaviani is not a DJ and has never considered himself to be one. In fact, he is actually more of a live musician than a DJ. The lines of his Live 2.0 stage setup are as clean and sleek as his music is spontaneous and robust, with each note played a result of inspiration gleaned from the crowd surrounding him. Ottaviani’s custom equipment setup may seem deceptively unassuming, though the aural mayhem he wreaks is anything but.One of the elements that set Giuseppe Ottaviani apart from most electronic dance music DJs is that he plays only his own music, his own remixes, and his own bootlegs. Ottaviani’s live setup involves keyboards, MIDI controllers and rapid access to not only every track and song he’s ever recorded, but to the stems of every track, he’s ever recorded. He also has access to an extensive sound library during live performances and this allows him to push his shows even further. With the Live 2.0 setup, Ottaviani is now able to incorporate layers of sound so that he is actually creating new music in real-time. The resulting symphony consists of dancefloor-shaking original Ottaviani productions with live elements – strings, keys, percussion or effects, played spontaneously – so that no two shows are identical. Audience members won’t see posing or guzzling of cocktails during an Ottaviani set; his mind and his hands are too busy devising new music on-the-fly. Together with the crowd, Giuseppe Ottaviani will be living the moment and having an intricate musical dialogue with his crowd each night.With the new Live 2.0 setup, Ottaviani will embark upon an entirely new way of performing that’s not been attained by other EDM artists. After this point, there will be no turning back.Dubbed a leader of the current Tech Trance revolution, Sneijder possesses a distinctive aptitude of fusing together euphoria and darkness; a trait that sets him apart from many. His skill is evidenced by the vast number of chart- toppers he’s created, including “Love of My Control” and “Away From Here,” his recent singles “Neutralize” ”Vaporize” ”Viper” & ”Polarize” are a masterclass in forward thinking, cutting edge club music.Adding his unique sound to remixes for Armin van Buuren, Aly & Fila & John O’Callaghan have seen Sneijder become one of the most in demand artists in Trance. Releasing records regularly on the industries most respected labels and boasting a back catalog of hit records have helped cement his name firmly amongst the list of Irish greats.In 2015, he unleashed his debut LP ‘Everything Changes’ upon the world, which showed off the true scope of his musicianship and additionally earned him countless accolades from peers and fans alike. His skills in production are hardly a surprise, with an immense knowledge of the dance floor paired with years of cutting his teeth on the club circuit, thus becoming well-versed in what sounds make the ears tick.Now, the maverick has reached the next step of his career: label owner. Sneijder launched Afterdark as a platform for himself and other similar caliber artists in 2016, firmly asserting his iconic status in the underground. Afterdark stands for all things dark, original and dance floor orientated, while also playing its part by cultivating the careers of the next generation of the Trance Elite. It’s safe to say Sneijder’s path will only continue in an upward direction as he moves into the next phase of his already prolific career.Still at the young age of 25 years old Argentinian Chris Schweizer has the world at his feet with his trademark big bassline sound fusing the boundaries between the big room sounds and trance. Signed to the mighty Armada Music label in Holland his releases are getting support from the biggest headliners across the globe including Armin Van Buuren, Paul Van Dyk, Ferry Corsten & Gareth EmeryHis latest productions have been getting regular airplays on the worlds biggest trance radio show ‘A State Of Trance’ as well as entering the beatport trance top 5 chart!With many more slamming productions forthcoming this year as well as major worldwide tours planned 2017 is going to be the year of Chris Schweizer!Scot Project is regarded as a legend in the dance scene. The genius behind some of the most epic tunes in the mid-’90s and early ’00s. Scot Project single-handed started the movement for the harder / edgier side of electronic music. One of the pioneers of Hard Trance!It all started in 1986, fronting a youth club in Frankfurt, and from there took up residency in many clubs around a city well associated with the dawn of Techno/Trance. His first release was in 1994 X, followed by the massive Underground hit “U” in 1995 on Positiva Records. His international breakthrough came in 2001 with his well known ultimate Anthem “O” (Overdrive) that was a game changer for the genre of Trance music. A second home run came with L (Want your Love). This took Scot Project on a journey around the globe for over a decade, performing at every major night club and festival on the planet, and regular appearances at landmarks shows like DanceValley, Sensation Black, Defqon1, Trance Energy, Tomorrowland, Global Gathering, EDC, Love Parade, Street Parade and the highest profiled clubs in the world such as Gatecrasher, Ministry of Sound, Godskitchen, Zouk, Limelight, Slinky.His discography of over 250 productions includes massive tracks such as “G” (Ghost, “T” (Techem), “FM” (Feeling Me) and His Album “A1”.

HIs superabundance of remixes and bootlegs includes artists like Marcel Woods, Sander van Doorn, Tiesto, U2, Daft Punk, Yoji Biomehanika, Organ Donors, Talla 2XLC, Public Domain, Lisa Lashes and many more. In 2010, Scot Project received a genre Beatport Artist Award and has had the honor of being supported by many legends in the world such as Tiesto, Ferry Corsten, Paul Van Dyk, Armin Van Buuren, Paul Oakenfold, Judge Jules, Yoji Biomehanika, and many more. After collaborations with Artists like A.S.Y.S, Organ Donors, Mark Sherry and NO. 1 chart success like W (whooo!) EP, P (paradise), Found Love and Recently Top 3 Track “W5 (Waiting for) showed a new direction for the Legendary master. 2017 will see Scot Project continue his venture into a territory he has been building towards for the past several years. Scots sound is now comprised of a diverse fusion between Progressive, Electro, and of course trance in its tougher form. A sound that can only be dubbed as “Scot Project sound”. As music evolves on its exponential path, new artists are introduced and make their climb to the top every single day. Some artists go the way of history, and yet, a few from the past continue to re-build, re-fresh and re-connect with the electronic generation. Scot Project is one of those.Shugz (Christopher Kirkpatrick) is a name that has appeared to come out of nowhere on the Trance scene. Combining youth, energy, electrifyingly impressive deck skills and notable production ability, it doesn’t take long to realize why there is such a fuss around this exceptional talent.Shugz’ DJ skills are arguably where his real talent lies. Relentless practice for years has to lead to an astounding array of deck wizardry, comparable to a very rare few in the scene. Often seen in sets using the 3rd deck, scratching, cutting & using layered effects, combining fast mixing and unexpected tune drops – Shugz is fast becoming a fan favorite. Having achieved local hero status in N. Ireland, Shugz recently debuted at the famous ‘Luminosity Beach Festival’ and was highly acclaimed as having the ‘set of the night’.Stakeofsound.com.myFacebook.com/stakeofsoundTickets:  Pre-sale – RM138

"Legendary German electronic music duo Modeselektor is back with a fresh new banger. I can already tell you that you’ve never heard (or seen) anything like this before. Modeselektor is famous for their unique and versatile electronic music sound, you never know what to expect from these guys, but they always deliver infectious productions. This time they teamed up with Estonian rapper Tomas Tammemets, better known as Tommy Cash, that you might know from his hits “Little Molly” and “Pussy Money Weed”. It really feels like they were meant to work together, both artists really complement each other and the synergy is amazing. While the song brings a totally unique experience, the video is no different, it is weirdly cool and artistic, but might scar your mind and give you nightmares for the rest of your days.Follow Us

"We are so delighted to bring you an absolute new gem from Montreal producer CRi. He recently dropped his “Initial EP” on Anjunadeep and part of that EP is the magnificent chill opus “Hidden Places“. CRi is not only one of our favorite Canadian music producers here at EKM, but he is also one of our favorite music producers period. Every single of his compositions is fantastic. He has his own unique style, he brings an immersive depth that very few composers are able to really achieve. You always have that feeling that he is taking you on a deep cerebral musical journey, his music tells a story, and you are a part of it.“Hidden Places” will transport you. Its gorgeous atmospheric and emotional ambiance sprinkled with its futuristic bassline and breaks flavors will only make you want more. The good news is, there are four more gems on this EP. This is a real treat.CRi quickly made his mark on the Montreal electronic scene by offering a singular sound influenced by house synths, syncopated snares, and a futuristic bassline. Self-taught, the artist managed to make a name for himself through his two EPs; Tell Her and Someone Else, on TOKiMONSTA’s label, Young Art. So far, 2018 has been a year full of great surprises for the artist, including a Juno nomination for the EP Someone Else as well as an MMVA and a PRISM nomination for the breathtaking clip Rush. His latest release, a mini EP containing two titles, marks the continuity of a work driven by his anxieties and his desire for introspection. CRi now returns with another short EP on Anjunadeep.Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/OfficialCRi/

"Looking to soundtrack your week? We urge you to seek out the latest collaboration from LSDREAM and Champagne Drip. Dropping through WAKAAN, the pair delivers an electronic masterpiece with ‘Eternal Now.’ Opening up about the track, LSDREAM shared his thoughts on the concept, saying: “Sam and I love the idea of freeform bass music as a platform. One that lets us express deeper emotions and creative ideas. We created something that embodied that, a melody that keeps evolving. It becomes more emotional. So if LSDREAM and Champagne Drip are only just landing on your radar, you’re in for a treat. Given a couple of impending releases from them on the way, 2019 is set to be a big year.   A spiritual being having a human experience. Champagne Drip is the newest musical incarnation of Los Angeles-based producer Sam Pool. It was born out of a philosophy that innovation springs from inspiration. Under the moniker of SPL, he spent 10 years releasing drum & bass, dubstep, and other styles of bass music. Work with respected labels such as Barcode, Tech Itch, Evol Intent, Rottun, SMOG and his own label Hollow Point Recordings soon followed.Because SPL’s music was fully immersed in sound design, musical landscapes showcasing melodic, dark, and refined touches were created.And 2019 is set to be the biggest year yet for Champagne Drip, with more releases on Wakaan and a nationwide tour alongside Liquid Stranger.Follow EKM.CO on:

"Baajewala has just dropped Quality Goods Records and the world a brand new EP. The producer shines brightly with the five-piece Hell Raiden. A YouTuber making instrumental covers since the age of 13, he  was inspired by Bollywood sounds from a young age. Later he discovered beat-making, and has since found widespread success. The likes of sumthin sumthin, Ian Munro, Quix and of course UZ are supporters of Baajewala, and each new release allows him to explore different musical ground. You may well have caught a Baajewala remix on UZ’s The Rebirth (Remixes) album last year. He comes out with a resounding bang with this EP. “The Boss” takes Eastern influences, lacing together unique melodies with undulating beats. “Pyaar” is deeply atmospheric, at least for the introduction. Shortly after it grips you in its lair; striking with heavy bass notes and a plunging stream of drops. Taking the pace up somewhat is “Mixed Emotions,” and it offers some sharpened rhythms amongst a drum-laden backdrop. Possibly the most epic in its form, it ensures nothing is held back on the climax. “Gando Wando” is another gritty cut – meandering, distorted notes and strong energy are the focus throughout.  The closing tune finds its way through the speakers out of quiet origins. Before too long there is an onslaught of sampling and shuddering effects to close proceedings.  Baajewala says: “This EP is the story of how a small town kid turned his biggest failures and heartbreaks into his weapon of mass destruction. UZ and QGR have been so incredibly supportive throughout the entire writing process, guiding me from an amateur bedroom producer to a confident professional. They’ve opened so many doors for me and have also put a spotlight on the Indian bass scene as well. Never in my life would I have imagined of releasing with sub a big label like QGR, but hey, dreams do come true!”Baajewala started off as a Youtuber at the age of 13, who used to do instrumental covers of Bollywood songs. Later got into making his own beats. Coming from an Indian background he has been madly inspired from Bollywood music as it was a huge part of his childhood. He tries to fuse his native influences with experimental electronic music. He has been supported by some great artists, who have also been his inspiration and influences, namely, UZ, sumthin sumthin, Ian Munro, Gladez, Quix and many more.

"Acidic Base, young producer from Chicago, dropped a superb 8-track Progressive House album that will surely rejoice fans of artists like Deadmau5 and Eric Prydz. The album packs so much epicness, it is a tour de force in terms of infectious and mesmerizing melodies and delightful progressive flavors.
The album truly delivers many different nuances of EDM / Progressive House. “Borealis“, “Halcyon” and “Chernobyl” offers the deeper, atmospheric & eclectic side of the album. “Blurred” and “Omnidirectional Hyperjet” brings the heavier and energetic Electro House touch. “Mountain Face” brings an emotional Trance feel and last, but not least, “Purple Skies” is as anthemic as Progressive House can be. Although the album is diversified and each track has a fresh unique feel, they all have one thing in common; invigorating and harmonically-rich melodies.  The album is an impressive production, Acidic Base is definitely an artist to keep on your radar. I wouldn’t be surprised to see him play big festivals very soon! Can’t wait to hear what he has in stock for us this year, make sure to follow him on his socials below!

"About a month ago, LA-based legendary Trap music producer RL Grime teamed up with graves on the anthemic “Arcus“, and today, French director Arnaud Bresson (from Division agency), delivered a fresh mind-bending music video for the track.The short movie tells the story of young men performing magic & illusions in the form of street art in France. While it might not sound super cool, Arnaud really created a unique and dark atmosphere mixing the street life, French street gangster-style, that reminds a bit of the classic movie “La Haine”, with the world of street performances. The whole video is very artistic, shady and mysterious, your eyes won’t believe what they are seeing and it will mess with your head. The moment that the video is over, you will have that feeling that it wasn’t enough and you’ll be asking for more! I seriously wish there was an extended version!“Arcus“, without a doubt one of the top bass tracks of 2019 so far, was released on RL’s very own label “Sable Valley“, a platform to not only release his own music but to also showcase and promote up-and-coming artists.If you like Arnaud’s style, make sure to also check out his work on The Peppers “Hot Caramel” (Soulwax Remix).RL Grime first came to prominence as a New York-based teenager delivering monster, viral remixes of Chief Keef’s “Love Sosa” and Kanye West’s “Mercy.” He established himself as a unique artist in his space with a striking monochromatic aesthetic, a series of animated music videos, and an annual Halloween mix that has included drops from Goosebumps author RL Stine, comedian Hannibal Buress, and Tony Hawk. After solidifying his fanbase with a few highly-regarded EPs, RL Grime independently released his first studio album, VOID, in 2014. It premiered as the #1 Electronic album in the United States and remained in that position for a month.At that point—with over 150 million plays, rave reviews, and magazine covers, and sets at the most prominent festivals in the world including Coachella & Lollapalooza – RL Grime stuck to his underground roots and further limited his releases. He made rare appearances in collaborations with artists including Big Sean, Miguel, and Skrillex, and starred in Alexander Wang’s #WANGSQUAD alongside Travis Scott & Zoe Kravitz. In late 2017, he emerged with “Era,” a tour-de-force single that Billboard described as “exotic, massive, and full-of-left-turns.” Its epic, cinematic sound announced a new era and an accompanying album: NOVA.RL Grime’s uncompromising artistry has paid off. NOVA was preceded by a sold-tour. Its hype has only swelled in the absence of information surrounding the album, leaving fans and blogs to their own speculation. With NOVA, RL Grime looks to further distinguish himself as an innovator in music, treading the line between millions of fans and an independent sound, the underground and the accessible, popular music and real art. RL Grime’s next chapter sees him opening the gates of Sable Valley, a new record label to release his like-minded artist’ music and vision as well as his own.Fri 3.22 – New Orleans, LA @ Buku Music + ArtFri 3.29 – San Isidro, ARG @ Lollapalooza ArgentinaSat 3.30 – Santiago, CHI @ Lollapalooza ChileSun 4.07 – São Paulo, BRA @ Lollapalooza BrasilThu 4.11 – Las Vegas, NV @ Encore Beach ClubSun 4.14 – Las Vegas, NV @ Encore Beach ClubWed 4.17 – Las Vegas, NV @ Intrigue NightclubSat 4.20 – Las Vegas, NV @ Encore Beach ClubThu 4.25 – Las Vegas, NV @ Encore Beach ClubSat 4.27 – Tempe, AZ @ Wet ElectricSat 4.27 – Las Vegas, NV @ Intrigue NightclubFri 6.14 – Manchester, TN @ Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festivalhttp://rlgri.me

"Aside From Music – Blank Page  Greg Newman AKA Blank Page has been working his way up the ranks with his standout progressive house productions and innovative remixes. After his debut release reached No.3 in the Trackitdown charts, and follow up EP receiving support from BBC Introducing, he has had a short but successful production career so far. We caught up with him to discuss what he gets up to outside out creating music.What other hobbies do you get up to?Ah man, my life really isn’t that interesting haha… I follow football and if I manage a weekend back in London then I’ll go and watch Crystal Palace, I grew up watching them week in week out! I try and hit some weights 2-3 times a week to allow me to then eat whatever I want the rest of the week. Obviously going out and having a social life as well… That’s a hobby, right? Drinking?I love TV series as well. Films and series are my chill time at home.What other genres do Blank Page listen to?A huge variety of dance music, from deep to tech, not just the progressive stuff that I produce. But away from dance music, it’s mainly hip-hop and British grime. I grew up listening to a lot of stuff recorded by rappers on phones who have gone on to big things – Tinie Tempah springs to mind! So when I want a break from the dance/electronic stuff that’s where I end up.Do you have any irrational fears?Snakes, open water, sharks… But they’re all rational right!?Tell us 3 interesting facts about yourself?Hmmmm… Interesting… I always struggle when people ask me this!
I have three rats, that’s unusual if not interesting! What else? I used to work in Formula 1.What is the one thing that you have always wanted to do?Climb a mountain! I’m almost 100% certain I would probably die.If you were on death row, what last meal would you order?Man, I can never answer this… It would probably be an Argentinian steak and potato dauphinoise. Or a pizza. Or my Mum’s spag bol. Or KFC. I can’t choose!What’s the best piece of advice you’ve received in your life?Do what makes you happy!What would you be doing if you didn’t get into music?I still work part-time so I guess I’d be working full time! My original degree was in motorsport engineering so I’d be doing something with cars.Do you have a job besides music?Currently part-time with Jaguar Land Rover developing their future engines, for however long people want engines for!What would you class as a perfect weekend?Perfect weekend? Easy. A Friday rave at a club with a banging sound system – the Friday bit is important to allow you to recover! Then a Saturday all day in the pub watching footy with the boys and then Sunday slobbing out at home!Where is somewhere that you have always wanted to live?I’ve liked the idea of living in New York in the summer but other than that only really London!Do you have an all-time favorite film and why?There are too many good films! I could never pick one.What is one of your pet hates?I can’t stand people who chew their food with their mouth open. Nobody needs to hear and see that shit! Chew like a human, not an animal!What are you most looking forward to in the next 10 years?Honestly, seeing where I am in 10 years time! Who knows what the future holds.If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money?I would set all my friends and family up so they never have to work again (if they don’t want to) and then have them all come and work with me!Blank Page Onlinewww.soundcloud.com/blankpagebeatswww.twitter.com/BlankPageBeatswww.instagram.com/blankpagebeats",articles23,"['Blank Page', 'Blank Page', '!

"In a few weeks, Kelsey Lu will drop her highly anticipated debut LP, Blood. Now, the cellist and singer has previewed the record by releasing its title track.Due out on April 19th via Columbia Records, the album follows up her celebrated debut EP, 2016’s Church. The forthcoming 13-track collection was produced by Rodaidh McDonald and boasts additional production credits from Adrian Younge, Jamie xx, and Skrillex. Lu’s sister, violinist Jessica McJunkins, also contributes throughout the project.Explained Lu,“Blood is a recognition of the Pain, the Horror and the Beauty of finding the ability to observe it all in order to move through it. We live to die another day and in the end be hopeful of whatever there is to come or not come at all, and ultimately make love while doing it.”The Solange collaborator’s latest song, “Blood”, comes on the heels of her past singles, the original Skrillex-produced “Due West” and a cover of 10cc’s “I’m Not in Love”. The new track, which was made with Younge, finds the innovative singer at her best. It’s a stripped-down and ethereal number highlighting her captivating voice and complemented by a lush, gorgeous strings arrangement. Lu has premiered the tune with a psychedelic animated lyric video from Dachi Cole.Watch the clip for yourself below.Blood Artwork:Blood Tracklist:

"Elle Fanning stars in Teen Spirit, the forthcoming directorial debut from The Handmaid’s Tale actor Max Minghella. In the feature, Fanning portrays Violet, a shy English teen who pursues her passion for singing by entering an American Idol-like competition.Keeping in line with the film’s premise, its corresponding soundtrack is chock-full of pop music, many of them popular hits sung and reimagined by Fanning’s character. Previously, we heard Fanning’s Violet cover the Robyn classic “Dancing On My Own”. For our latest music preview, today Fanning has shared an original song titled “Wildflowers”.(Read: 2017 Music Producer of the Year: Jack Antonoff)Fanning handles the vocals throughout, but her channeling of Violet isn’t the only star power presence on the track. Credited with writing “Wildflowers” are pop bigwigs Carly Rae Jepsen and Jack Antonoff, the Bleachers leader also known for his acclaimed work with St. Vincent, Lorde, and Taylor Swift. Tavish Crowe, who has written extensively in collaboration with Jepsen, also contributed.Take a listen to “Wildflowers” below.The Teen Spirit soundtrack also features Fanning’s takes on Ellie Goulding, Tegan and Sara, and Annie Lennox. It’s due out on shelves April 5th, with the film hitting theaters one week later on April 12th.Revisit the Teen Spirit trailer below.In related news, last month Jepsen released not one, but two new tracks: “Now That I’ve Found You” and “No Drug Like Me”.",articles40,"['Elle Fanning', 'Teen Spirit', 'Keeping', 'Fanning’s', 'Violet', 'Taylor Swift', 'Teen Spirit', 'Fanning’s', 'Ellie Goulding', 'Tegan and Sara', 'Annie Lennox', 'Teen Spirit']"
"Back in February, Motown announced it would release Marvin Gaye’s lost 1972 album, You’re the Man. Now, four days ahead of what would have been the soul legend’s 80th birthday, the previously unheard record has been revealed.You’re the Man was originally conceived as a follow-up to Gaye’s classic 1971 concept album What’s Going On. Released in the summer of 1972, the LP’s titular single centered on the presidential election between Richard Nixon and George McGovern later that year. Former Motown CEO Berry Gordy disagreed with the tune’s political leanings, declaring the lead single to be “the worst piece of crap I ever heard,” and stifling promotion of the song. As a result of the volatile differences in ideology between the record exec and the soul singer, Gaye decided to shelve You’re the Man entirely.Today, we finally get to hear the rest of the record’s tracks, 15 of which have never been pressed to vinyl before. The 17-song collection includes the music from the original album as well as Gaye’s additional work from that time period, including a rare extended take on “I Want to Come Home for Christmas”. It also features a handful of mixes from famed producer Salaam Remi, such as the previously released “My Last Chance”, “Symphony”, and “I’d Give My Life for You”.You’re the Man is also available as a double-vinyl LP. The physical copy sports new liner notes from biographer David Ritz, who examines “Gaye’s deeply personal internal conflict as a source of creative vigor and emotional burden as he experienced What’s Going On’s massive success and all that came with it.” For more of Gaye’s classic works on vinyl, head here.You can stream You’re the Man below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>You’re the Man Artwork: You’re the Man Tracklist:

"Origins is a recurring new music feature that presents artist with the challenge of digging into the inspirations behind their newest track.On what happens to be his 60th birthday, Jane’s Addiction frontman Perry Farrell has announced Kind Heaven, his first collection of new material in over a decade. Sharing its name with the Kind Heaven Orchestra collaborative project he launched last year, the LP is due out June 7th via BMG.Farrell pulled in a number of his talented friends to help create the LP, including co-producer and longtime David Bowie associate Tony Visconti. Other contributors include Dhani Harrison, Elliot Easton of The Cars, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins, and Farrell’s wife, Etty Lau Farrell. Hollywood composer Harry Gregson-Williams — whose credits include The Equalizer series, Gone Baby Gone, and many of Tony Scott’s films — helped take the alt-rock to symphonic heights with his orchestral compositions.To support the album, Perry Farrell’s Kind Heaven has mapped out a North American and European tour that includes stops at Lollapaloozas in Paris, Stockholm, and Chicago. There are also plans for a Las Vegas extravaganza that promises to “combine leading edge technology and Hollywood style storytelling and take visitors on a sensual exotic journey that offers the best of Southeast Asian culture, music, food, fashion, exoticism, exploration, mystery and spiritual enlightenment.” More details on that intriguing show are forthcoming.As a first listen to Kind Heaven, Farrell has shared the lead single “Pirate Punk Politician”, a track he described in a press release as “a good old fashioned protest song about today’s strongmen and their tactics of oppression.” Crunchy guitars drive hard over electronic textures, a choppy reflection of our disjointed current reality. “Stood you up now with a wink/ Got you all to double think,” sings a searingly satirical Farrell, taking on the voice of one of the world’s all too present autocrats. “I cut your job, I raise your rent/ ‘Cause I’m your so called president.”Take a listen below.For more on the cultural movements, art, and protests that led Farrell to write “Pirate Punk Political”, the legendary rocker has broken down the song’s Origins.#NeverAgain Movement:As we watch the world seemingly unravel — the proverbial “glue” that holds us together, keeping us within the bounds of reason, are the children. Their prophecies are the guiding light of tomorrow. I am inspired to join their cause and admire their determination and wisdom; they are beyond their years.Pussy Riot:The bravery of these young women is humbling – flying their free flag in the face of autocratic leaders, shouting out from within the bowels of oppression, doing it all with flair and confidence. Women with the courage to speak truth to authority, using our most powerful medium to connect with the people – Music.Raymond Pettibon:Raymond Pettibon’s artwork is immediately deviant. His subjects are unsettled and contentious. Through their protest, these images reveal the absurdity of our modern world.Double-Speak:We are living in a time where truth and non-truth coexist. News and “fake news” can both make the headline. One is based on reason and common sense; the other is rooted in irrationality and raw emotion. A certain portion of the populace not only believe in the farcical, they prefer it, and defend it.Kind Heaven Artwork:Kind Heaven Tracklist:

"Modest Mouse are back.The Pacific Northwestern indie rockers last dropped an album in 2015 with Strangers to Ourselves. Today, they’ve shared their first new music since then in the form of a new single “Poison the Well”.Full of the group’s trademark jerky indie, but with a subtle a gothic edge thanks to some sneaky synthesizers and a vamping violin. Frontman Isaac Brock also adds a particular lilt to his delivery as he bellows, “Medicine makers they are trying to kill us/ They know how to cure us, but they bet that’s bad for business now.” Take a listen below.<Following its digital release, “Poison the Well” will be released on Record Store Day (April 13th) on a triangular mint-green 7-inch black with another unreleased track on the B-side.

"Portishead vocalist and lyricist Beth Gibbons has released her collaborative album with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra. Stream Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs) below via Apple Music or Spotify.The new project captures Gibbons and the Polish orchestra performing Henryk Górecki’s 1976 piece, Symphony No. 3 (Symphony of Sorrowful Songs). Their original live performance took place in 2014 in Warsaw and was conducted by Krzysztof Penderecki, considered one of Poland’s greatest composers and past collaborator of Aphex Twin and Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood. Penderecki’s works have also been adapted for the big screen, most notably appearing in The Shining, The Exorcist, and David Lynch’s Twin Peaks.(Read: The Top 50 Albums of 1997)Because Gibbons neither speaks Polish nor reads sheet music, she prepared for the collaborative performance by working off “an especially prepared vocal score bearing the original text, a phonetic interpretation, and – crucially — a translation.” She explained in a statement:“Whether singing one of her own lyrics… or one of the symphony’s… she is aiming at a direct emotional injection from performer to audience. In the voices of the symphony’s text, as in life, she is a mother and daughter.”Gibbons and the rest of Portishead last put out an album way back in 2008 with Third.

"Billie Eilish has officially premiered her new album, WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?. Stream it in full below via Apple Music or Spotify.Out through Darkroom/Interscope, the 14-track collection serves as the debut album for the 17-year-old pop prodigy and our 2018 Rookie of the Year. It follows Eilish’s Don’t Smile at Me EP from 2017, which boasted breakout singles in “Bellyache” and “Ocean Eyes”.(Read: The 20 Essential SXSW Acts to Catch on Tour This Spring)WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP was written, produced, and recorded by Eilish with assistance from her brother Finneas in their childhood home of Highland Park, Los Angeles. Ahead of the LP came early singles in “you should see me in a crown”, “when the party’s over”, and “bury a friend”.Eilish, who’s received cosigns from the likes of Thom Yorke (!) and Dave Grohl, talked a little bit about her songwriting approach in an interview I conducted late last year:“I write in characters a lot, so it’s not necessarily anything that I’m going through at all. It’s just art … like you don’t have to be going through it to write about it, you know? You don’t have to be feeling it at all.A lot of songs on the new album are fictional and from a perspective that’s not you, which is what I like to write the most about. I don’t necessarily want to write about my life — there’s only so much going on in my brain! So it’s just coming up with new characters and new everything.

"Lil Uzi Vert’s 2019 has gotten off to a rocky start, with the Luv Is Rage 2 creator first declaring he was “done with music” in mid-January. A day later, he backpedaled, explaining that his record label, Generation Now, was preventing him releasing music. Now, the rapper has released a new song “Free Uzi” that seemingly alludes to the drama.Per a report from Complex, Uzi’s much-hyped sophomore album Eternal Atake has been finished since at least December. In the past few weeks, the hip-hop favorite ramped up his “Free Uzi” social media campaign against his original label. After revealing earlier in the week that he turned to Roc Nation for help, yesterday, he was officially added to the roster of the Jay Z imprint, which undoubtedly facilitated today’s single.Lil Uzi Vert’s new track “Free Uzi” draws its name from the ongoing debacle. The song, which was released on Soundcloud and Jay Z’s streaming platform TIDAL, marks the rapper’s first new music in 2019. Though the single doesn’t directly call out Generation Now, Uzi hints at his grievances, offering pointed lines like “I can’t trust none of these niggas, might turn on me/ I’m still a millionaire, this shit not hurtin’ me/ But it’s hurtin’ you.” He also details past problems with the IRS, noting, “Had to get my business together/I had $3 million in taxes/I got it all off on this level/They said it’s $3 million missing/I ain’t say nothing, I stay level.”Update: Watch the track’s video below.While “Free Uzi” is the Philly-based artist’s first standalone track of the year, Uzi has appeared as a guest collaborator on “Multi Millionaire” off Lil Pump’s late-February release Harverd Dropout. He has also been announced on a number of international summer festival, including Soundset, Rolling Loud, Something in the Water, and others.",articles40,"['Lil Uzi Vert’s', 'Roc Nation', 'Jay Z', 'Jay Z', 'Lil Pump’s', 'Soundset']"
"Earlier this month, indie rock stalwarts Sebadoh announced Act Surprised, their first new album in six years. After sharing the lead single “celebrate the void”, the band is back with another lowercased track, “stunned”.Where the former track took the despondence of uncertainty into a cathartic release, “stunned” sticks to a scuzzy stagger. In an embittered growl, Lou Barlow expresses his frustration with a world that won’t slow down: “Give me a shout when you get mellowed out/ I can’t get caught up in all this/ To the degree we believe what we see/ And what we’re doing is all done.”“The incessant bombardment of the senses with media and advertising can lead to a kind of self-defensive paralysis,” the band’s Jason Loewenstein said of the track. “I am completely stunned at this point.”The song comes via a lo-fi video that pieces together a seemingly random collection of clips to mirror the sensory overload addressed in the lyrics. Take a look below.Act Surprised is due out May 24th on Dangerbird Records. Pre-order it now, and pick up more Sebadoh vinyl over here. You can also get tickets to Sebadoh’s North American summer tour here.Last year, Barlow appeared on Kyle Meredith with… to talk about Sebadoh’s new album and more.

"Spanish star Rosalía breathed new life into flamenco music on her widely acclaimed 2018 album, El Mal Querer. Today, she’s returned with her first new song since that LP, “Con Altura”.A collaboration with J Balvin and frequent producer El Guincho, the track pays tribute to classic reggaeton. The 25-year-old Rosalía explained in a press statement:“Con Altura” is an homage to the more classic and original reggaeton: reggaeton playero. When I was younger I loved listening to reggaeton and it could have been natural for me to make a song like this before, but I don’t like to force anything. As a musician I let myself be guided by my intuition in every moment.I am very proud of this song and believe in it so much, because there is inspiration in a genre like reggaeton, but in a subjective and personal level, from a place of power and strength.”Accompanying the single is a flashy video helmed by Director X. It shows Rosalía throwing a vivid, boisterous party filled with cool outfits and even cooler dance moves. The last time I tried to fly, I was stranded in the Mexico City airport for 10 hours, and customers of WOW Airlines have it even worse right now. So, where can I sign up for Air Rosalía?Check out “Con Altura” below.“Con Altura” Artwork:Read Rosalía’s full statement on “Con Altura” below:“Con Altura” is an homage to the more classic and original reggaeton: reggaeton playero. When I was younger I loved listening to reggaeton and it could have been natural for me to make a song like this before, but I don’t like to force anything. As a musician I let myself be guided by my intuition in every moment. It wasn’t until a few months ago in a studio in Miami where I started writing in this direction: I proposed to my cowriters that we work with a Dominican sample I found, then Frank Dukes added his own sample, and El Guincho added percussion, and the record was born, a Barcelonan-American- Latin pop vibe. Once the beat was built, I wrote the hook in less than five minutes, and when that happens it’s for a reason. I am very proud of this song and believe in it so much, because there is inspiration in a genre like reggaeton, but in a subjective and personal level, from a place of power and strength. I didn’t hesitate to show the song to my friend Jose (J Balvin) and he loved the track and sent over such a fresh and raw verse. I think all the pieces of this puzzle came together and are there for a purpose. I really hope that everyone who listens to it receives it with the same love with which it was made.”In addition to a few US tour dates, the breakout singer is expected to play summer festivals like Coachella, Lollapalooza, the UK’s Glastonbury, Montreal’s Osheaga, Mexico’s Ceremonia, and NOS Primavera Sound in Portugal.

"Noname kicked off the new year with “Song 31”, an impressive offering which promptly landed on our New Sounds playlist of must-hear tunes. The Chicago rapper is now planning to release a follow-up track, aptly titled “Song 32”, on April 5th.“Song 32” might be Noname’s last for a bit, as she intends on focusing on her other “goals.” “After I put out ‘Song 32’ I’m laying low for a while,” she wrote Thursday in a since-deleted tweet. “I ventured off from my initial goals and it’s time to get back to them.”“Thanks for all the love and support along the way guys,” the MC added. “I know I joke at my shows a lot but yall mean so much to me.”Noname’s last full-length, Room 25, was named one of the best of 2018.

"Rammstein are set to release their first album in nearly 10 years in May, and they’ve just unleashed the video for the first single, “Deutschland” (watch below).The clip is one of the most epic rock videos you’ll ever see, taking viewers on a journey through German history, with the members of Rammstein appearing in different eras, including a medieval battle, an Industrial Revolution bare-knuckled fight between frontman Till Lindemann and guitarist Richard Kruspe, and a futuristic hospital-like scene.One scene shows the hanging of Lindemann and other various band members, dressed in striped prison uniforms. That clip was teased yesterday and met with condemnation from Jewish leaders in Germany who accused the band of trivializing The Holocaust. In the full video, the prisoners exact revenge on the fascist guards, but we also see Kruspe and later Lindemann dressed in Nazi uniforms, as well.Throughout the video appears a strong female figure, who, in some scenes, carries the severed head of Lindemann.The song itself combines industrial guitars with electronic effects, at times both heavy and dance-y. Interestingly enough, the first two words out of Lindemann’s mouth are “du hast”, perhaps a nod to Rammstein’s most well-known song of the same name.See the full video below. As reported earlier, Rammstein’s new album, which is untitled, arrives May 17th, and is available for pre-order here. In support of the new album, Rammstein will embark on a European tour beginning in late May.

"On a recent episode of Kyle Meredith With…, Hannah Joy of Middle Kids revealed the band has some surprising fans, like Will Arnett. It looks like they’re gearing up to earn some more listeners, too, because they have a brand new EP on the way.New Songs For Old Problems, the upcoming EP, will drop on May 24th via Domino. The six-song EP will see the trio continue their brand of emphatic, guitar-forward indie pop. This EP comes after the band’s popular debut album, Lost Friends.(Read: Middle Kids break down their debut album, Lost Friends, Track by Track)This announcement also comes with a brand new single called “Real Thing” about each person’s “lifelong quest for meaning,” according to Joy. “It’s the quiet, persistent voice in the stillness that constantly checks to see if you truly think you’ve found the thing you’re looking for.”“Real Thing” begins with solemn-sounding guitar tremolo and Joy’s powerful vocal sighs. Once the chorus hits, though, all three members join forces to create a bittersweet melody backed up with fuzzed-out guitar. It’s layered and effortless — the type of music Middle Kids made a name for themselves with. The song also comes with a music video directed by Marie Pangaud.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature which challenges an artist to dish on some of the inspirations behind their latest offering. Since their formation more than five years ago, psych pop outfit Blood Cultures have quite literally been all about the music. Purposely remaining elusive — their true identities are unknown to us and even their own publicist! — and clad in balaclavas, they specifically focus on the pure aural experience, unhampered and undistracted by the typical PR hoopla and music marketing.For their first single of 2019, “Flowers for All Occasions”, Blood Cultures are offering up a very specific sonic incident, one based on actual event ripped right from the headlines. In the early ’90s, a number of local TV stations in their home state of New Jersey were hijacked, their regular programming replaced with audio from an unknown source. Today’s new song is meant to be a reimagining of that rogue incident.“An individual (or group of individuals) known as ‘Blood Cultures’ has chosen to recreate the audio and imagery that they once heard, saw and felt,” a press release simply states. “Blood Cultures has no name or face, but are simply the vessel for resurrection of this once forgotten broadcast.”“Flowers for All Occasions” succeeds in expressing the mysterious nature of that TV station hijacking. There’s something about the fuzzy vocals and quality of production that makes the song not only feel like it’s from another decade, but even another reality entirely. Meanwhile, soft handclaps and pastel, ballooning synths add a layer of sweetness and innocent charm — almost suspiciously so, given the track’s cryptic origins.Check out the spooky yet enticingly saccharine tune below.For more background on the song, Blood Cultures divulged to Consequence of Sound some specific inspirations that led to the birth of “Flowers of All Occasions”.New Jersey Television Broadcast Hijacking:In the early 1990s, several of New Jersey’s local television stations experienced one of the largest broadcast signal hijackings in history, replacing the networks’ regular scheduled programing with audio and imagery from an unknown source.

"Leave it to Bedouine to start the morning off right with some beautiful, slow-blossoming folk. The Syria-born, Los Angeles-based folk singer-songwriter announced her second album, Bird Songs of a Killjoy, will be released May 31st via Spacebomb Records.With the album announcement comes a new song off the record called “Bird”. In a press release, Korkejian describes drafting the song on her recorder and emailing it in an exchange. “’Bird’ is about loving someone so much that you’re willing to loosen your grip on them,” she says. “It was written as a love letter with the intent of delivering it. It’s one of my favorite memories regarding the power of song. I had so much to communicate and this was the only way I was able to get it all down.”Unlike her most recent song “When You’re Gone”, “Bird” builds off the usual gentle acoustics of Bedouine with yawning horns and soft piano chords. It’s a subtle slice of orchestral folk that fits comfortably between Nick Drake, Jose Gonzalez, and Joni Mitchell. The song’s music video sees Bedouine walking through a hazy fog singing directly to you, the viewer. Check it out below.Bird Songs of a Killjoy Artwork:Bird Songs of a Killjoy Tracklist:

"By now, it should come as no surprise that King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard are a bunch of overachievers. In 2017, the Australian psych rock group made good on their promise to release five albums over the course of the year. This January, the band promised more new music was on the way — and boy, they keep on delivering on that.Today, the band shared a brand new song called “Boogieman Sam” off their upcoming album Fishing For Fishies. This new song comes after the release of two other singles: the wobbly jam “Cyboogie” and the album’s title-track. It seems the band is hitting their stride again, and so far each song keeps living up to expectations.(Read: Band of the Year King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard Can’t Stop, Won’t Stop)Instead of getting heady like they did in 2017, the band makes “Boogieman Sam” sound like a ’70s throwback, complete with rolling guitar licks, a soulful harmonica part, and gentle background harmonies. It makes sense given the group promised this new album has its roots in blues music. The laid-back sound suits them well.

"British rapper slowthai has been using his grime-y bars to reveal personal insights and take his home country to task on numerous singles and EPs over the last few years. Now, the rising MC is set to drop his debut full-length, Nothing Great About Britain, on May 17th via True Panther Records/Method Records.The 11-track effort finds the 24-year-old using his own story to make a greater point about life in the United Kingdom. Explaining the album in a press release, slowthai said,“It’s basically my experience of growing up [in the UK]; of having a family that were immigrants originally, of the stories they’ve told me, of my childhood and how I’ve lived my life. Through it, I’ve gone on a journey of explaining how everything I was chasing to make me feel good only clouded my judgement. And it took me going through a ton of shit to realise that none of these things – no money, no drugs, no fake relationships – is gonna make me happy, or make me a good person.”Nothing Great About Britain features production from Kwes Darko, with Mura Masa and Slaves helping on the tracks “Doorman” and “Missing”. slowthai’s fellow grime artists Jaykae and Skepta also appear on “Grow Up” and “Inglorious”, respectively.

"Last summer, veteran indie rockers Interpol dropped off Marauder, their first album since 2014. Less than a year later, fans will have another treat to add to their collection: On May 17th, Interpol will release a new EP titled, A Fine Mess.Due out through Matador, the forthcoming collection was recorded during time spent in upstate New York with Dave Fridmann (Sleater-Kinney, The Flaming Lips). Additional production, mixing, and engineering work came courtesy of Kaines & Tom A.D. and Claudius Mittendorfer, who previously worked on Interpol’s 2007 LP, Our Love to Admire.(Read: The Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)The new EP is comprised of five songs, including the previously shared title track and concert favorite “Real Life”. There’s also today’s offering, “The Weekend”, a song in which frontman Paul Banks finds himself in awe of a beautiful relationship that’s blossomed over the course of a weekend.“That really happened/ We believe it/ It’s really magic this time / Feelings even,” Banks describes his euphoria. “It’s really happening now/ Let the weekend spin right to the end.”Take a listen to “The Weekend” below.Pre-orders for A Fine Mess have begun.

"Earlier this year, The Black Keys drummer Patrick Carney launched a new band called Sad Planets. He’s joined by John Petkovic, of Cobra Verde and Death of Samantha fame, and together, they’re gearing up to release their debut album.Named after both musicians’ hometown, Akron, Ohio is due out April 19th through Tee Pee Records. The superduo initially teased the forthcoming project with February’s heady offering, “Not of this World”. Today brings a second cut in “Yesterday Girls”.Colored with winding, grinding guitars and a stomping energy, it’s a suitable listen for a night spent knocking back a few at the local watering hole. The track’s accompanying video just so happens to be set in a dive bar, but instead of having a good time, Carney gets tangled up in a fight involving special guest Cheetah Chrome, formerly of punk outfits Rocket From the Tombs and Dead Boys.Check out “Yesterday Girls” below.Along with Sad Planets, Carney is pulling double duty with The Black Keys, who are finally back from hiatus. The blues rockers broke their silence this month with their first song in five years, “Lo/Hi”. Additionally, The Black Keys announced a 31-date “Let’s Rock Tour” with Modest Mouse, tickets for which can be found here.Complete your Carney collection by picking up all of Black Keys’ releases on vinyl over here.",articles40,"['Earlier', 'The Black Keys', 'Sad Planets', 'Cobra Verde', 'Akron', 'February’s', 'Today', 'Dead Boys', 'Sad Planets', 'The Black Keys', 'The Black Keys', 'Modest Mouse', 'Black Keys’']"
"At the start of the year, Cage the Elephant announced an April 19th release for their new album, Social Cues. One of the most noteworthy entries on the 13-song tracklist is a collaboration with Beck dubbed, “Night Running”, a name which has also been given to their forthcoming co-headlining tour. Today, Cage has unleashed the highly anticipated collaborative cut as the LP’s latest single.The release follows Social Cues’ lead single “Ready to Let Go”, which fell in line with the group’s more indie-rock sensibilities, and the creeping “House of Glass”. For its part, “Night Running” draws inspiration more from reggae (conceivably a product of Beck’s influence), with an opening featuring a dubbed-out bass line and psychedelic, airy effects. As the group lands in the chorus, the track evokes Cage the Elephant’s more traditional songwriting, with a catchy chorus featuring call-and-response vocals to create a full, well-layered sound.Take a listen to “Night Running” below, and pre-order Social Cues here. You can also get your hands on past Cage the Elephant releases on vinyl here.Cage the Elephant and Beck’s “Night Running Tour”, which kicks off in July, will feature support from Spoon throughout, as well as Starcrawler, Wild Belle, and Sunflower Bean on select dates. 30 shows are currently scheduled across North America, so check out the itinerary below and pick up tickets here.Cage the Elephant and Beck 2019 “Night Running Tour” Dates:

"Last week, Australian producer Flume dropped Hi This Is Flume, his first new music since winning a Grammy for 2016’s Skin LP. The mixtape consisted of a whopping 17 new tracks, including appearances from the likes of JPEGMAFIA, slowthai, SOPHIE, and others. Now, the electronic whiz kid born Harley Strete is back with even more fresh material, this time in the form of a standalone single dubbed “Friends”.The track features vocals from Reo Cragun, a rising hip-hop artist out of Washington state. Over Flume’s stuttering, thudding beat, Cragun sing-raps of putting a hard stop on a toxic relationship: “Burnt that bridge, yes you did/ Your heart ain’t full of love like this/ Burnt that bridge, yes you did/ I don’t wanna be friends I don’t wanna be friends.” Take a listen below.Flume dropped the track during an appearance on triple j radio. While he demurred on the idea of a proper full-length, he did tease that fans can expect more new music as the year rolls on. Hopefully we’ll hear some at one of his festival appearances this summer, including Lollapalooza, Osheaga, and Outside Lands.",articles40,"['SOPHIE', 'Osheaga']"
"Next month, Swedish singer-songwriter Kristian Matsson will issue a new album as The Tallest Man on Earth. It’s titled I Love You. It’s a Fever Dream. and marks his first proper full-length in four years.Fans had their first taste of the Dark Bird is Home follow-up with “The Running Styles of New York”, released last month. Matsson is back today with an equally stirring second single dubbed “I’m a Stranger Now”.As its disheartened title suggests, the track sees Matsson articulating, and rather poetically, the agony he feels as he and his partner grow apart. “A little drop of poison in the rain, a little drop of madness in my heart,” he describes.“Now so deep into the forest with my Swedish little heart/ I am nowhere near your sunset it’s so quiet after all/ And I’m a stranger now, I’m a stranger now.”Listen for yourself below.I Love You. It’s a Fever Dream. lands in stores April 19th through Rivers/Birds Records. In a previous statement, Matsson reflected on some of the revelations he discovered while working on the LP.“Making the album I was thinking a lot about the lenses we view our lives through, and that, for some reason, our worst tendencies seem to be carried out so loudly, while our best can go unnoticed.” He added, “I’ve come to realize that some of the most powerful, most inspiring moments in my life have been the most subtle and that so often the thing that deserves my attention, is trying the least to get it.”Matsson is currently supporting the LP on an extensive spring tour.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature which challenges an artist to reveal the influences that gave them inspiration for their newest track.This Friday, Kevin Devine will release the 12th entry in his long-running Devinyl Split Series. Closing out the second volume of the series, the 7-inch split single is a collaboration with his close friends and tour mates, The Front Bottoms. The A-side featured TFB covering Devine’s “Just Stay”, with the singer-songwriter himself featuring on the track. Those roles are flipped for the B-side, which sees Devine delivering his version of “Rhode Island” as The Front Bottoms back him up.Taken from TFB’s 2011 self-titled debut, “Rhode Island” is a horn-backed acoustic emo-punk track that’s tinged with sort of scrappy production befitting the band’s early material. In putting his own touch on things, Devine plugs in for a much fuller sound, sustained notes replacing the trumpet and layering TFB frontman Brian Sella’s vocals under his own for a richer timber. It’s an ode to the original, for sure, but one that brings completely new life to the composition.Take a listen below.In a unique take on our Origins series, Devine has pointed to some of the things he heard within “Rhode Island” upon first hearing it. “Since I didn’t write ‘Rhode Island’ (though I wish I did), I’ll tell you about what I heard when I fell in love with it,” he explains.Read on to see the references he picked up in the track, and pre-order Devinyl Splits No. 12 via Bad Timing Records. You can also head here to snag some more Devine vinyl, or here if you’re looking for Front Bottoms wax.The Weakerthans — “One Great City!”:John K. Samson is the once and reigning king of a very satisfying and influential iteration of articulate, literate punk rock, invested with a certain understanding of people and how we move around, glimpsed through an endless and expanding ocean of poetically-rendered character studies. His bonsai-eye for detail and the attendant empathy that calls forth set his work apart. It’s with great respect and adoration, then, that I attach Brian to his lineage (and sort of did immediately upon hearing TFB), and I think some of his finest snapshot moments are present here: “Mora cut her hair in Baltimore, right before I left/ I watch her sitting by herself, talking to herself/ Breathing calmly, then trying to catch her breath.” Three-dimensional moments, quotidian and real; what actually comprises a life. It’s John’s lane, but Brian built his own off-ramp.The Mountain Goats — “No Children”:The rolling, rising, possessed delivery; the unspooling collage of unflinchingly humanistic images, of self and others, seen; the thrust and energy and momentum, the chaos, legible inside the accomplished lyricism. Front Bottoms are a world-class party band, and an unbeatably caffeinated live act — they are seriously fucking fun — but the secret weapon, what separated and separates them from their peers, has always been what Brian sees, how he paints it, how you see yourself in the gallery. This guy’s pretty good at that too, I guess.The Violent Femmes — “Kiss Off”:The aesthetic similarities between early Front Bottoms and Violent Femmes are clear and straight-lined: acoustic-punk scrappers who, in shifting measure, cover up (and explode) their vulnerability with sarcasm, insouciance, and bratty pluck, and find some community and transcendence in the ensuing stew. Brian’s got a louder heart and more obsessive character eye, but the first time I saw TFB I definitely saw the connection. (Once I bled on Gordon Gano’s guitar at some weird alt-rock-radio show on Long Island; he was a tremendously kind sport about it. Unrelated, but true.)",articles40,"['Devine', 'The Front Bottoms', 'Devine', 'Devine', 'The Front Bottoms', 'Devine', 'Brian Sella’s', 'Devine', 'Devine', 'Front Bottoms', 'Violent Femmes', 'Brian’s', 'Gordon Gano’s', 'Unrelated']"
"Last month, Foxygen announced their sixth studio album Seeing Other People. Now, the Los Angeles-based duo of Sam France and Jonathan Rado have released a new song called “Face the Facts”.The track follows up the record’s lead single, “Livin’ a Lie”, departing from its melancholy tone with a groovy, synth-heavy performance. On the catchy number, the duo is accompanied by drummer Kane Richotte (Portugal. The Man) and string instrumentalist Rob Moose (Bon Iver, Alabama Shakes), as well as the group’s own “Radotronics.”“Face the Facts” explores what it’s like to become an irrelevant musician, offering a tongue-in-cheek list of regrets and impossibilities. While some of the tune reads as genuine, it walks the line between sincere and ridiculous, with absurd banter like “I’m never going to see your face again/ I’m never going to dance like James Brown/ I’m never going to be black/ and I’m never going to get you back” making it hard to take too seriously.Regardless, the song fits well with what we’ve heard from Seeing Other People thus far, continuing to move the group in the self-proclaimed “Sad-Boy Plastic-Soul Adult-Contemporary Cartoon-Noir” direction they’ve been promoting. You can listen to Foxygen’s latest below.Pre-orders for Seeing Other People are ongoing before it drops on April 26th via Jagjaguwar.

"Orange County hardcore act Fury return with their sophomore album, Failed Entertainment, on May 3rd, and the California band has teamed up with Heavy Consequence to premiere the song “Vacation” and its accompanying video (watch below).“Vacation” has a an old-school Black Flag-like vibe, with singer Jeremy Stith delivering a raspy scream over punk guitars. Stith tells us of the track, “I have different visions in my head each time I think about this song and today it’s [actor] Harry Dean Stanton talking about predestination and each human’s capabilities and their place in the world. He talked about how we will do what we do and the outcomes will be what they will and as much choice as we might have in the big scheme of things, the fact is just like earth, humans weren’t here at one point, then we were, and soon we won’t anymore.”He continues, “The song in a way is about grief and the stuff that comes along with it like the denial and anger and the bargaining in situations where you come short. We can only hope for acceptance that we are nothing and Love is everything. ‘Peace comes from within, do not seek without.’ I’d like to think [late comedian] Garry Shandling would like this song the most out of all of the ones on the album.”As for the video, director Mason Mercer explains, “My understanding about the song ‘Vacation’ (and Failed Entertainment in general) is that the band is observing how people use amusement to numb themselves from reality/pain, thus numbing themselves from truth and joy in the process. I wanted the video to reflect that.”He adds, “In the video, four guests are slowly awakened from a ‘vacation simulation’ only to find that they have been rotting away in a shoddy cheap motel … I wanted the camera work to be reminiscent of a Disney ride. In one uninterrupted flow you are driven through the consecutive scenes and only shown what you are meant to be seen.”Failed Entertainment is available for pre-order in various bundles via Run For Cover Records. Fury are playing a handful of California shows with Gorilla Biscuits beginning tomorrow night (March 28th) in San Diego. See the dates below.Fury 2019 Tour Dates with Gorilla Biscuits:

"Slowly but surely, K-pop is gaining ground in mainstream musical circles. Arguably leading the charge is the seven-piece BTS, what with their forthcoming world tour and Saturday Night Live debut. Now, not only is the group taking over charts around the world, they’re straight up taking over the songs, as bandmember RM has dropped in on the remix of HONNE’s “Crying Over You”.The track, which also features BEKA, is taken from HONNE’s recent sophomore album, LOVE ME/LOVE ME NOT. For the remix, the electro-soul outfit lets RM (formerly known as Rap Monster, mind you) drop a few bars on top of the snappy beat. “We always wanted a rapper over ‘Crying Over You’, so it was great when RM was up for featuring on the track and the part he’s written has continued to explore, and add to, the emotion of our original version,” HONNE said in a press statement.Adding his own lyrics to the breakup jam, RM raps, “We thought we gave each other a whole world but turns out that we didn’t know such a thing/ Guess life’s like this, shit happens/ And we look for the magic but/ Good things always come to an end.” Take a listen below.BTS drops their new album, Map of the Soul: Persona, on April 12th, and they’ll appear the very next night on SNL.

"After releasing lead single “No Halo” last month, folk rocker Kevin Morby is back with another new song from his upcoming double album, Oh My God. The track, titled “Nothing Sacred/All Things Wild”, sees Morby singing softly above a gently tapped congas. Behind him, a saxophone slowly unfolds and a gospel choir oohs. It’s a more organic, open-ended sound compared to his previous guitar-forward album, City Music.As Moby himself explains in a press release, “Nothing Sacred / All Things Wild” is an apt look into how the rest of Oh My God will sound:“’Nothing Sacred’ was the moment that Sam [Cohen, the producer] and I stumbled into what would become the sonic landscape of Oh My God by breaking the songs down to their parts and doing away with a conventional band. Rather than I play the song on guitar as originally intended, Sam suggested I only sing while he play organ and Nick [Kinsey], who is the drummer of my live band, play congas. Within moments of the first take it became clear what the record was to become, and how we wanted to represent the songs. What you’re hearing here is a first take and the sound of us walking into a new discovery.”(Read: Blood on the Tracks: Beth Orton and Kevin Morby on Bob Dylan’s Songwriting Process)The track comes with an accompanying music video directed by filmmaker Christopher Good and produced by Andreina Byrne. The clip sees a barefooted Morby walking through a greenhouse where everything around him appears to be from a dream: a woman happily entangled in vines, children sleeping on the tile floor, football players tackling one another in white smoke, sketches of plant seeds evolving. It’s vivid and slow, giving you plenty of time to soak up the images.Watch the video below.This isn’t the last collaboration you will see from Morby and Good. The former stars in a short film directed by the latter that’s also called Oh My God, featuring music from the album and acting as a visual accompaniment to it. The short will premiere next Wednesday, April 3rd, at Los Angeles’ Hollywood Forever Cemetery. The screening will be followed with a solo performance from Morby.Once Oh My God officially comes out on April 26th, Morby will be hitting the road in support of the LP. His 2019 tour dates will see him playing across North America and Europe, with a few festival stops along the way.

"Praise be to pop, Sky Ferreira has returned! Over five years after her debut LP, Night Time, My Time, dropped in 2013, the indie pop favorite has shared a new single.“Downhill Lullaby” serves the first preview of Ferreira’s long-awaited follow-up record, Masochism, which is due out later this year. The track was produced by Twin Peaks music supervisor Dean Hurley and features strings by Danish violinist Nils Gröndahl, who interpolates a portion of The Verve’s “Bitter Sweet Symphony”. Take a listen now.Update: Turns out Ferreira was “JOKING” about the “Bittersweet Symphony” reference. “It doesn’t have anything to do with The Verve’s ‘Bitter Sweet Symphony.’ It’s completely unrelated,” she tweeted, adding, “I spent so much time recording/writing/arranging it & having people play it. It’s completely original.” She also promised to release “another version where you can hear all of the strings/what was recorded too.”The arrival of “Downhill Lullaby” follows years of label drama holding up the release of Masochism. Last summer, Ferreira temporarily lost access to her Soundcloud account. “The point to all of this: don’t give your logins to record labels,” she wrote in a note that also pointed to rampant industry sexism as a roadblock to her new material.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Pop Albums of 2019)The post must have shaken something loose amongst the label brass, as Ferreira eventually regained access to her SoundCloud and released a cover of “Voices Carry” by the Aimee Mann-fronted outfit ‘Til Tuesday. Now, she’s putting the finishing touches on Masochism ahead of a release later this year.Ferreira said she mostly produced Masochism herself with assistance from Ariel Pink collaborator Jorge Elebrecht, while Tamaryn aided in the writing. In an interview with Pitchfork, she said the album features “more poppy” songs, as well as more “abstract,” orchestral stuff. “It’s very big, but also very violent,” she explained. “But not all the songs are super-dark.” She also teased another album track tentatively titled “Don’t Forget”, a new wave composition “about burning down houses.”“Downhill Lullaby”:",articles40,"['Sky Ferreira', 'Ferreira', 'Dean Hurley', 'The Verve’s', 'The Verve’s', 'Ferreira', 'Ferreira', 'Ariel Pink', 'Pitchfork', 'Forget']"
"black midi have been together barely a year, but already their young CV boasts impressive milestones. The London-based rockers sold out their first pair of gigs in New York, as well as managed to land on countless “best of” lists following their SXSW debut earlier this month.The early accolades aren’t just hype for hype’s sake, though; the rabid reaction stems from the band’s equally untamed approach when it comes to their music, which folds in — or rather, smashes together — bits of post-punk, experimental jazz, indie rock, math rock, and whatever black midi can find wafting through the speakers of their game room. The result is something like today’s “Crow’s Perch”, their new single via Rough Trade, once the label home of indie rock greats Arcade Fire, My Morning Jacket, and Alabama Shakes.For every different genre that you can pinpoint, black midi fire off yet another plot twist. In that way, listening to “Crow’s Perch” and all of its unpredictable, jerking breakdowns is like playing one of those fast-paced video games for the very first time — you have no clue what’s coming next, but you’re down for the ride. And what an exhilarating ride black midi provide.Hear it for yourself via its official music video, directed and edited by Vilhjálmur Yngvi Hjálmarsson.“Crow’s Perch”, the title of which naturally references a video game, follows their January-released single “Speedway”.

With a new studio built in their own backyard and adding a second child to their clan, the fortitude of their family artistry comes through in fresh and powerful ways.That visceral drive for co-survival is addressed right on the record’s opening track, “I’m Comin’ Out”. With a stomp that seems cheery in the face of trudging through life’s muck, Hearst and Trent gird themselves for any inevitable tests of will. “It’s fight or flight in the springtime,” they sing. “I got the taste of blood in my mouth/ Metamorphosis, what a test is this.”Take a listen below.For more on what went into “I’m Comin’ Out”, Shovels & Rope have shared the track’s Origins. Read those below, and snag some more of the group’s music on vinyl here.Pregnancy:We were newly pregnant and imagining what it is like to be born, naked and vulnerable. Are babies in the womb wondering what’s on the other side of the warm red wall of its mother’s body? No matter what circumstances into which we are born, we all emerge screaming and kicking, armed with nothing but the innate human drive to live propelling us into the arms of our caretakers. We pictured the infant working up the courage to emerge.Baby Deer:We literally saw a new born deer lying down in a panic in the middle of the road. We waited a few seconds and it stood up carefully and scampered away, but it was so new and so vulnerable in the moment that it just didn’t know what to do. It got its bearings though, its mother was probably across the street, saying encouraging deer words.Man as Animal:It seems like people forget that humans are animals, but we are as savage an animal as there is. We as a species are as vicious and invasive as any creature that has ever been. It’s as if our divine selves (or perhaps alien DNA) is always fighting against our human animal DNA for control over the human condition. At the end of the day most of our decisions are based on fight or flight reflexes. We loved the idea that we are all born, literally, with the “taste of blood in our mouths.”Butterfly Transformation:The caterpillar is a humble creature, a glorified worm, that eats and travels until it’s compelled to seal itself off in a cocoon, emerging completely transformed. This seemed like the perfect allegory for any human’s experience of self-realization – breaking thru a depression, redefining yourself after a loss, coming to terms with change or the finding of new inner strength. The phrase “ to come out” in our culture is usually associated with coming to public terms with one’s sexuality — and the butterfly allegory carries over beautifully, its wings symbolizing, perhaps, a rainbow flag flowing colorfully in the breeze. We often dedicate this song, in honor of their journey, to our LGBTQ friends, fans and family but this song is about finding your inner magic and motivation – wherever that leads.Instruments in the Studio:This song was one of the few that was born in the studio and not on the road. It was also one that that practically wrote itself. It was as if the lyrics were handed over by whisper from another dimension and all we had to do was write it down. The studio we built has provided an exclusive work space where the tools to ply songs out of the ether are always at hand. We have learned that we have to give ourselves the space and time to hear the music in our heads — especially since that space is usually now occupied by the sound of our children expressing their needs.Birthday Suit:There is something very cool about showing up to battle naked – aren’t there accounts of Julius Caesar fighting naked? Gauls and Celts, who were covered in fierce tattoos. In this song “your best suit” refers to the suit you’re born with, but we also liked the idea of showing up looking really dapper in something expensive ready to be soaked in blood and guts in battle — like who cares, imma look good while I slay my fears.Shovels & Rope will be on the road all summer supporting By Blood.

"Seattle-based quartet Tacocat are gearing up for the release of their latest album, This Mess is a Place. The follow-up to 2016’s Lost Time is due out May 3rd, and today the band is previewing their forthcoming release with a new single called “Hologram”.The song finds the indie-punk band leaning heavily into their pop sensibilities, offering introspective and thoughtful lyrics paired within the saccharine composition. As lead singer Emily Nokes croons, “Just remember if you can/ Power is a hologram,” the group comments on power dynamics and the nature of reality. All the while, their feminist discourse is housed within an immensely catchy number, as you can hear for yourself below.Tacocat’s fourth full-length LP overall, This Mess is a Place marks their first album on Sub Pop. Produced by longtime collaborator Erik Blood, the record addresses the United States’ political climate in a post-Trump world. Per a press release, the upcoming collection is about “figuring out how to respond to a new reality where evil isn’t hiding under the surface at all — it’s front and center, with new tragedies and civil rights assaults filling up the scroll of the newsfeed every day.” However, despite this somewhat dark subject matter, the band twists these ideas, delighting in each track’s political critique with energy and hope.(Read: The 100 Best Pop Punk Bands)As Nokes explained, “We can examine some hard stuff, make fun of some evil stuff, feel some soft feelings, feel some rage feelings, feel some bitter-ass feelings, sift through memories, feel wavy-existential, and still go get a banana daiquiri at the end.”Previously, Tacocat released lead single “Grains of Salt”. Pre-orders for This Mess is A Place are going on now, and you can find the artwork and tracklist below.

"Ahead of their new album, Age of Unreason, punk stalwarts Bad Religion have unveiled the new fast-paced song “Do the Paranoid Style”, which clocks in at just 1 minute and 44 seconds.As previously reported, Age of Unreason will arrive on May 3rd, marking the veteran punk outfit’s 17th album since forming nearly 40 years ago. “Do the Paranoid Style” follows the previously released track “Chaos From Within”.A press release explains that the new song was inspired by historian Richard Hofstadter’s 1964 essay “The Paranoid Style in American Politics”, and “compares contemporary right wing conspiracy theorizing to a feverish dance craze.”Guitarist Brett Gurewitz adds, “When fringe groups blame shadowy forces for their problems it is, at worst, delusional. But when those holding the levers of power do the same thing, it’s not delusion, it’s a method of delegitimizing the opposition. It’s a tool of authoritarianism.”Along with the new song comes an accompanying video that splices in mid-20th century propaganda imagery with vintage clips of people dancing. Watch the full clip below.Age of Unreason marks Bad Religion’s first album in six years, with 2013’s True North being their last release. The band will be performing at three of the four stops of the traveling Sabrosa Festival, including the kickoff event on April 6th-7th in Dana Point, Calif. They’ll also be playing the inaugural Camp Anarchy festival, taking place May 31st through June 2nd in Thornville, Ohio.

"We’ve heard plenty of music from Mikal Cronin over the last few years, just none of it has been his own material. The California garage rocker has appeared on the last few albums from frequent collaborator Ty Segall, including his 2017 self-titled LP and one of last year’s best records, Freedom’s Goblin, plus he teamed up with Kim Gordon for the anti-Trump rocker “War/Golden God”. Now, Cronin’s returning to his solo career with his first new music since 2015’s MCIII.On May 10th, Cronin will release a two-song 7-inch via Brooklyn-based bedroom label Famous Class. The Los Angeles-based sessions saw Cronin and his “many talented friends” recording live for the first time in his career while Jason Quever handled the boards.(Read: In the Red Records: 25 Years of Punk, Garage, Fuzz, and Scuzz)As a first listen, Cronin has premiered the A-side, “Undertow”, via Stereogum. The track’s breezy drive carries with it a healthy share of angst, the knotty guitars trying to tangle up the ambition at the lyrics’ core. As Cronin explained in a press release,“It’s easy to get caught up in an undertow, pulled down into the water, weightless and directionless. The current stirs and you lose your way. But eventually, if you’re lucky and patient, you can float back up to the surface and take a breath. This is my first new music in a while — my gulp of air.”Take a listen below. Pre-orders for “Undertow” b/w “Breathe” are going on via Famous Class. In addition to a classic black version and a coke bottle blue UK exclusive edition, a special hand-poured pressing will be limited to 400 copies. Each 7-inch piece of vinyl will feature a unique mix of compounds to provide a “one of a kind starburst of colors.” You can see some examples below, and pick up Cronin’s past vinyl releases here.“Undertow” b/w “Breathe” 7-Inch Artwork:",articles40,"['Kim Gordon', 'Cronin’s', 'Garage', 'As Cronin', 'Cronin’s']"
"Last month, we reported that Corey Taylor had collaborated on a track with UK rapper Kid Bookie, after the rhyme-slinger hit up the Slipknot frontman on Twitter.To quickly recap, Bookie tweeted that the Slipknot track “Wait and Bleed” was as iconic as System of a Down’s “Chop Suey!”, and later direct tweeted Taylor, saying, “I gotta work with you before both of us leave this earth.” Much to Bookie’s surprise, Taylor responded, and before you knew it, the two were collaborating on a track.Now, the fruits of that Twitter exchanged have been unveiled in the form of the song “Stuck in My Ways”, which has Taylor showing off his rap skills, as the metal vocalist chimes in with his own verses at around the 2:30 mark (listen below).In a message on Instagram, Bookie wrote of the track, “This wasn’t for the culture, it’s for the world, infinite love to my brother @coreytaylor because we created an absolute monster and I’m for ever grateful for the love and more dude for real, if we perform this prepare for the world to implode , shout out @lewiscullen on the production, wizard beyond means, thank you to @jon_e_clayface for absolutely KILLING those riffs, a weekend session and you helped contribute to a beautiful moment on the planet, thank you to @olahbliss for adding the most aggressively sweet BV’s known to man kind, @denmarkstreetstudios for the sexiest mix ever, eternally grateful my love and most importantly.. THE FANS AND SUPPORTERS CAUSE WE AINT SHIT WITHOUT YOU, WORD!”Taylor lent his talents to the track during a busy time for Slipknot. The band is gearing up for tours of Europe and North America, and will release their much-anticipated new album on August 9th. Tickets for their upcoming shows are available here.Recently, Slipknot announced that they were parting ways with percussionist Chris Fehn after he filed a lawsuit against Taylor, Shawn “Clown” Crahan, and several Slipknot-related parties over an alleged breach of fiduciary duties.",articles40,"['Kid Bookie', 'Taylor', 'I’m', 'BV’s', 'Slipknot']"
"Back in the fall, the Damon Albarn-led supergroup The Good, the Bad & the Queen released their long-awaited album, Merrie Land. Now, the ever-prolific Gorillaz bandleader has turned his sights to Africa Express, his long-running collective dedicated to promoting African music and artists.Today, the group has released a new EP called MOLO, which means “hello” in the South African language of Xhosa. The collection boasts four electronic tracks created in collaboration with Western and African artists over the course of a week. Sonically diverse, the effort represents a span of talents and African influences.(Read: The Good, The Bad & The Queen give Track By Track breakdown of new album, Merrie Land)Opening song “Nayena” is the most traditionally electronic, with a heavy beat guiding the number as African vocalists contribute throughout. In contrast, second cut “No Games” sports a minimalist and slower rhythm, offering collaborators a chance to be highlighted with distinct rap verses. The album then picks up with “Xhosa”, propelled with a frantic bassist, call-and-response chorus vocals, and horn flourishes. The record closes with Phuzekhemisi’s collaboration, “Vessels”, highlighting the acoustic guitar as well as buoyant xylophone and laidback backing beat.The EP serves as a precursor to a full-length album coming this summer from the project’s newly created label, Africa Express Records. To create the new material, Africa Express flew to Johannesburg, South Africa, with musicians like Gruff Rhys, Nick Zinner, Ghetts, Mr Jukes, and others working with stars of the South African scene including Blk Jks, Infamous Boiz, Morena Leraba, and Maskandi guitar legend Phuzekhemisi.Listen to MOLO and watch Africa Express’ promotional video below.Africa Express also has plans to headline the Waltham Forest London Borough of Culture celebrations in Leytonstone, UK.

"Rock supergroup Filthy Friends are just a little over a month out from the release of their sophomore album, Emerald Valley. The star-studded outfit — comprised of Sleater-Kinney’s Corin Tucker, R.E.M.’s Peter Buck, King Crimson’s Bill Rieflin, The Minus 5’s Scott McCaughey, and The Fastbacks’ Kurt Bloch — previously teased with lead single “Last Chance County”. Today brings a second preview in “November Man”.As with its predecessor, the new song takes a stark look at present-day America under the bleak “leadership” of Trump. “Long skinny tie/ And hair of gold/ You made the deal/ Our future sold,” Tucker croons, her almost funereal tone accompanied by biting, razor-edged guitars.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)Check it out below via the lyric video, which features an image of the White House (via Stereogum).Additionally, the outfit has shared a new album trailer:Emerald Valley arrives May 3rd and follows 2017’s Invitation.

"The last four years saw Marina and the Diamonds embark on a journey of self-discovery. The process of looking inward yielded a new name, MARINA, as well as a double album of new music titled LOVE+FEAR.Her first LP under the moniker, it’s being previewed today with new single “Orange Trees”.

"Bay Area thrash metal stalwarts Death Angel have released a consistent stream of inspired material since reuniting for 2004’s The Art of Dying. The band is best known for their debut, 1987’s genre classic The Ultra-Violence, and they have maintained a overtly thrash style (with hints of prog) from that album onward. Today, Death Angel announced that their ninth studio album, Humanicide, will drop May 31st via Nuclear Blast, and unveiled the disc’s ferocious title track (stream below).The song is an old-school thrasher with crushing drums and shredding guitars in the ’80s Bay Area vein. Mark Osegueda’s vocal performance is particularly inspired and unhinged, with his deliberate snarls as confident and spry as they were in the Ultra-Violence days. It stands as one of the strongest speed metal tracks released so far this year and gives the band’s longtime fans the steady dose of head-banging riffage they’ve come to expect.“I wanted to write something that metal fans could really grasp onto,” Osegueda said of the song. “Something dark and intense, that still makes sense. Right now I think it’s so apparent that the Earth is in a sickened state.”[Watch trailer for Murder in the Front Row: The San Francisco Bay Area Thrash Metal Story]Of the song’s inspiration and structure, he added: “When I wrote the music for our song ‘Humanicide,’ I was shooting for an album opener that would have all the elements of an epic thrash opus. This meant a classic metal style intro leading into a ferocious ‘Bay Area Thrash Riff-o-Rama’ complete with a crazy middle build up section to ramp up the circle pit until it’s all whipped up into a frenzy by the time the frenetic guitar solo hits, then concluding with a maniacal musical section leading into the outro.”For Humanicide, Death Angel returned to Audiohammer studios and producer Jason Suecof (Deicide, Trivium), who worked on the band’s previous three albums. The record was mastered by Ted Jensen (Slipknot, Pantera) of Sterling Sound, with artist Brent Elliott White providing the savage cover artwork.“This collection of songs represents the band in its current state — united, vital, intense and (still) hungry like the wolf!” guitarist Rob Cavestany said in a press release for the album. “I wanted this record to be quite diverse stylistically while obviously keeping with the parameters of metal. DA has been known to push the envelope and we absolutely did this time.  So many emotions expressed through our music, very much looking forward to adding these songs into our live set list. As I savor this rare feeling of satisfaction, we proudly unleash this beast upon thee!”Death Angel join thrash cohorts Overkill and Act of Defiance for a monthlong run of spring tour dates, which are listed below.

"As previously reported, rock supergroup The Damned Things will release their second album, High Crimes, on April 26th. Featuring members of Anthrax, Every Time I Die, and Fall Out Boy, the band has now released the second single from High Crimes, the dark pop song “Something Good” — stream the lyric video below.Funk rhythms trade with cheerleader chants (“Y-E-L-L/ All of my friends are going to hell”) during the verses of “Something Good” before suddenly bursting into a heavy power-pop chorus. On the surface, it’s a pop song in sound and structure: far lighter and less manic than the previous single, “Cells”. But as singer Keith Buckley revealed, it’s a song penned with black humor.“‘Something Good’ is a feel-good song about feeling bad,” Buckley said in a press release. “It’s about hurting people you care about because it is not in your nature to do the right thing even when you want to. A dark moral story with a really sunny feel.”The band was formed with Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian began jamming with Fall Out Boy guitarist Joe Trohman in 2008. They were then joined by current Volbeat guitarist Rob Caggiano (then of Anthrax); Buckley of Every Time I Die; and bassist Josh Newton; as well as Fall Out Boy drummer Andy Hurley, to record the 2010’s Ironiclast and tour in support of the album. For the new album, Caggiano left the band, Newton helped write the songs then departed, and Alkaline Trio‘s Dan Andriano took over on bass.High Crimes was produced Jay Ruston and is available on April 26th via Nuclear Blast.

"Josh Ritter returns next month with Fever Breaks, his tenth album overall and follow-up to 2017’s Gathering. The 10-track collection was produced by four-time Grammy winner Jason Isbell and features his band The 400 Unit.Already Ritter has teased the record with “Old Black Magic”, a must-hear tune we promptly added to our regularly updated New Sounds playlist. Today brings a second offering in “I Still Love You (Now and Then)”.Born and raised in Idaho, Ritter nurses a broken heart here, as he remembers an old love who has since moved on with her life and started a new family. “When the night falls over all of everything that’s been/ And everything we were/ And cannot begin again/ I still love you now and then/ When I think of ya,” sings a doleful Ritter.Take a listen below.Fever Breaks officially hits stores April 26th.

"It’s a good day to be a Mötley Crüe fan. The film adaptation of their debauched memoir The Dirt is finally available on Netflix today (March 22nd). And to commemorate the release, the band has dropped the final pair of new songs that they have recorded for the soundtrack to said movie.Following the release of the song “The Dirt (Est. 1981)” and a cover of Madonna’s “Like a Virgin”, the Crüe have unveiled two more original songs —  “Crash and Burn” and “Ride With the Devil” (stream both below). On the tracks, Mick Mars’ bluesy guitar playing is as meaty as ever, punctuated with squealing solos. Tommy Lee’s drums work around the groove like Ginger Baker at his best. And Vince Neil holds on for dear life, his still-recognizable vocals fading a bit with the years and mileage he’s put on them.According to an interview that bassist and songwriter Nikki Sixx gave to Billboard about the new Crüe tunes, the band was only under the gun to write one fresh song for the soundtrack to The Dirt but they felt so inspired that they came up with a bunch of originals that they whittled down to three, plus the Madonna cover.[Film Review: The Dirt Never Asks Tough-Enough Questions of Mötley Crüe]What any of this means for the future of Mötley Crüe is anyone’s guess. The band has said that they are holding true to their commitment to never tour again, but reserve the right to hit the studio and make more music. For now, fans will have to make good with the movie soundtrack, which is now available to purchase or stream.However, at least one member of the group isn’t waiting around for the phone to ring. Vocalist Vince Neil has tour dates scheduled off and on throughout 2019, including a gig tonight (March 22nd) at the Jackson Rancheria Casino in Jackson, California; a show on March 29th with Great White and Slaughter at the Official Black Bear Casino in Carlton, Minnesota; and an appearance with Sammy Hagar’s Full Circle Jam Tour on May 20th at the Rose Music Center at the Heights in Huber Heights, Ohio.

"Following her breakout debut single, “Sororicide”, New York’s Raffaella inked a deal with Mom + Pop. The up-and-coming alt-pop songwriter is said to be diligently working on her debut EP for the renowned local indie label, which has put out records by Courtney Barnett, Sunflower Bean, and Tash Sultana.Raffaella gave us a peek at her new material with last summer’s impressive “Bruce Willis” single. Today, she’s back with “NASA’s Fake”, a tune that continues to showcase her solid, but still evolving, songwriting skills and sound. Its message of “Leave your problems at the door, and instead just dance” is also a piece of sage advice everyone could probably use right about now given our sad state of affairs.On the track, Raffaella runs into minor inconvenience after minor inconvenience (an ignorant doctor, late drug dealer, misspelled name), but ultimately decides to let it all go. And it’s through this that she finds a sense of freedom and lightness. She explained in a press statement:“The night we wrote it I got home and showed it to my sister and then, soon after, started complaining to her about something stupid and momentary and she started singing the song back to me — right away I realized my problems were really not that bad… that’s what the song’s meant for, it’s like a reminder you can dance to.”Take a listen below.",articles40,"['Raffaella', 'Raffaella']"
"Chicago rap collective Pivot Gang have been teasing their next project for a few months now. First came “Blood” back in the fall, followed by “Jason Statham, Pt. 2” last month. Now, the Saba-led crew has unveiled their latest track, “Studio Ground Rues”, along with an intimate, behind-the-scenes look at their place of work.(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Hip-Hop Albums of 2019)Produced by Daoud and daedaePIVOT, the chilled track does exactly what its title suggests it does: set the ground rules for what it takes to step into Pivot Gangs’ Chicago studio. “Don’t stand out/ Sit down/ Shut up/ Oh you smoke? Roll up,” lays out Saba on the hook. “Don’t stand out/ Don’t call next on 2K, you not next/ Don’t pop up/ Be low-key till we say you can speak.” Frsh Waters drops in next with his nonchalant yet captivating delivery, followed by MFnMelo’s dexterous warmth.Check out the clip for “Studio Ground Rules” below.There’s no word yet on when we’ll be hearing a proper project from Pivot Gang, but Saba has plans of his own lined up for the summer. He’s set to appear at festivals like Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza, and Electric Forest, as well as J Cole’s Dreamville Festival.

"Track by Track is a new music feature in which we give an artist the opportunity to dig deep into each track on their latest record, one at a time.Animal Collective member Dave Portner, aka Avey Tare, has today released his latest solo record, Cows on Hourglass Pond. The entire thing is available to stream below via Apple Music or Spotify.The new effort serves as the follow-up to Tare’s 2017 LP, Eucalyptus, as well AnCo’s 2018 album, Tangerine Reef. He produced the LP himself and mixed it alongside Adam McDaniel at Asheville, North Carolina’s dropofsun. The sessions were captured on a Tascam 48 half-inch reel-to-reel tape machine.In his review of Cows on Hourglass Pond, Consequence of Sound’s Tyler Clark said of the album,“The search for intimacy and connection powers the best work of Portner’s catalog (the longing ‘Grass’, the anxious ‘Peacebone’, the lovestruck ‘Bluish’, among others), and on Cows on Hourglass Pond, it returns to the fore after a half-decade of sonic wandering. The record finds Portner fruitfully preoccupied with the contours of aging; whether he’s accentuating the positive (the bubbling ‘What’s the Goodside?’) or probing humanity’s fixation on the unattainable (‘Taken Boy’), Portner’s lyrics radiate a relatable combination of wary optimism and well-earned bittersweetness without ever tipping over into the realm of sanded-off platitudes.”The record was preceded by singles “Taken Boy” and “Saturdays (Again)”. You can stream the whole thing below. You can also snag more of Avey Tare’s catalog on vinyl here, and pick up tickets to his forthcoming tour here.For more on the album, Avey Tare broken it down Track by Track. “I’m usually more of a fan of the choose-your-own-adventure approach to my songs,” he told CoS. “Having said that, it’s nice to have a word in something you’re putting out there. For better or worse I hope this brings some light on the record.”Read what he had to say below.“What’s the Good Side”:
Feels like we are all bubbles made of bubbles made of bubbles and so on. All of material existence is like an aqueous foam spinning out of control in all directions. Also, we are not unlike the spaceship in the game Life Force (Konami 1986, check it out) floating from level to level with an infinitely black space background. We are also getting older. Not just my friends or I but all of humanity. I wonder if there was a time when we were better than we are now or if it’s always been this way. Whatever your reality is, I think it’s important to check up on the people around you and close to you. Ask them, “Whats the good side?” Make sure they’re doing alright.“Eyes on Eyes”:
The title of this one says it all. The act of making eye contact. It’s a thing most of us do time and time again everyday. I wonder if eye contact (I mean deep heavy eye contact) is one of the reasons people hold onto other people for so long. They enter the doorway to some other place inside people where they stick and stay for the duration.“Saturdays (Again)”:
“Again” because there are a lot of songs about Saturdays, songs by Elton John, Bay City Rollers, Grateful Dead, Cat Stevens, and Chicago. “Saturday Night” by the Bay City Rollers has actually been covered something like 12 times. I remember the version by Ned’s Atomic Dustbin from 1993. Really what “Saturdays (Again)” is about though, is the expectation a lot of people put on “special” days. Birthdays, holidays, or Saturdays. And how rituals create emotion.“Nostalgia in Lemonade”:
There are a lot of Traveler songs. Here’s another. Nostalgia is often a big aspect of songs I like. I’m not the first to say that it plays a big part in a lot of great songs. A big place for nostalgia is within a home or love left behind. Maybe the leaving was just temporary. Distance seems to be able to create both problems and joy, chaos and clarity. So I think that’s all in there.“K.C. Yours”:
The Robots are coming and I guess at this point there isn’t anything we can do about it. As the integration of robots into our life becomes more present each day, I wonder when someone crazy enough will come around and attempt to create a savior Robot. Or maybe a savior Robot will create itself and is doing so right now.“Our Little Chapter”:
This is one of my collage-style songs. I’ve probably learned most things from the long lasting relationships I’ve had/have. They have the ability to be everything all the time. These lines are just snippets of feelings or moments in time pulled from the history of some of these bonds.“Taken Boy”:
This is about those often unattainable things that we long for. Or the feeling that underlines having a crush on someone. We pine for an experience that may or may not be the greatest thing that ever happens to us. Those feelings that are based on the imagination or maybe something floating in the atmosphere. I also wonder if this is the day to day reality of a lot of us on this planet. If it’s some unattainable perfection or disaster that we pine for but may never reach.“Remember Mayan”:
A lost civilization that I think must inhabit some part of my sub conscious or dream state. Also dreams I had that I was sure existed. Being at the top of the world and then suddenly finding yourself some place completely different.“HORS_”:
The basketball game. “HORS_” is just an example to me of how language has twisted and contorted and multiplied something by its meaning. That is to say, there are many horses we have known and many to come. Perhaps a horse will one day only be robotic. I saw a horse playing with a giant rubber ball in a small pasture while on a train across the country. I could see the excitement and playfulness in its eyes and to this day it’s one of the more captivating visions that has stuck with me.

"Creed frontman Scott Stapp looked like he was in a dark place for awhile there. Back in 2014, he found himself broke and in the throes of drug addiction. Things got so bad that he had a full-on psychotic break, which eventually led to a bipolar disorder diagnosis. Now, however, with the help of MusiCares (and Scott Weiland’s ghost), Stapp is five years sober, a feat he’s celebrating with the release of his first new solo record since 2013’s Proof of Life.Due out in July from Napalm Records, the new album is called The Space Between the Shadows. It also follows 2017’s The Madness, an LP Stapp made with Art of Anarchy, a band that used to feature Weiland on vocals.According to a press release, the new material serves as a “manifesto of lessons learned in the six years since [Stapp’s] last release.” That certainly sounds true enough with the lead single, “Purpose for Pain”. Describing the track, the rock singer said,“’Purpose for Pain’ is about seeking a higher meaning, a spiritual mentality when dealing with our struggles and life’s painful moments. There are unexplainable, dark times that everyone goes through, and that pain is real. If we can dig deep and hold on to hope during the most difficult situations, believing there is a purpose waiting for us on the others side, we can find meaning and clarity that gives us the strength to keep fighting.”Take a listen below.In support of The Space Between the Shadows, Stapp will head out on a US summer tour.

"The wait is finally over: Sky Ferreira has announced a new song, “Downhill Lullaby”, and it’s due out next Wednesday, March 27th.The forthcoming track comes more than five years (!) after the pop singer’s breakthrough debut album, Night Time, My Time. Ferreira has been steadily working on and teasing new material since then, but record label drama and other professional matters led to a delay in its release.At one point in Summer 2018, Ferreira was denied access to her own SoundCloud account. “The point to all of this: don’t give your logins to record labels,” she wrote at the time, along with a note describing how rampant sexism in the industry has affected her ability to release music.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Pop Albums of 2019)After regaining control of her SoundCloud, Ferreira eventually put out a cover of “Voices Carry”, originally by the Aimee Mann-fronted outfit ‘Til Tuesday. The track came with an optimistic note about her future plans.“The only thing I can say is I am truly confident in what I’m making/capable of,” the singer tweeted, “it’s truly been a rollercoaster through hell in order to make it happen this time. It’s been a learning experience.”(Read: The 13 Scariest Pop Songs)Last November, Ferreira seemed to confirm on Instagram that there, indeed, was light at the end of the tunnel, and that new music was just months away. She previously listed Masochism as the title of her forthcoming record, and it’s believed she’s been assisted in the studio by Ariel Rechtshaid, in addition to executive producers Mike Dean and Rahki.As we await “Downhill Lullaby”, peep its official artwork below, which sees Ferreira ominously peeking out from a pitch-black background.“Downhill Lullaby”:Revisit her ‘Til Tuesday cover:<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>",articles40,"['Sky Ferreira', 'Ferreira', 'Ferreira', 'Ferreira', 'Til Tuesday', 'Ferreira', 'Ariel Rechtshaid']"
"Next month, Bruce Hornsby will reveal his first album in three years, Absolute Zero. For the effort, the Grammy-winning pianist and songwriter enlisted help from a number of special guests, including past collaborator Justin Vernon, who pops up on a track called “Cast-Off”.The song, also co-written by the Bon Iver genius, is one about “acceptance and even gratitude in the face of rejection, egolessness, patience and humility,” per a statement from Hornsby (via Pitchfork). He elaborated further,“This song was put together in Eau Claire, WI last April, starting with an unused film cue, developed and expanded upon in the studio with spontaneous contributions from Sean Carey (who just walked in and started singing), Jeremy Ylvisaker (playing guitar that doesn’t sound like guitar!), Mike Lewis and JT Bates on sax and drums, Brad Cook (and later Noisemaker JV Collier) on bass, and Justin and I taking turns in the vocal booth trading ideas and melodies. Pretty much, mostly concocted right there at April Base!”(Read: The 100 Greatest Movie Soundtracks of All Time)Musically, “Cast-Off” is a natural melding of both Hornsby’s and Vernon’s worlds. On the one hand, there’s a cinematic coolness to the tune, a nod to Hornsby’s acclaimed work for the big screen (see: all his material with 2018 Filmmaker of the Year Spike Lee); the song’s intricately layered arrangements also call to mind a less electronic version of Bon Iver’s 22, A Million.As an added bonus, “Cast-Off” also contains a pretty dope line that would’ve made for the perfect AIM Away Message: “I kinda ain’t sh*t, but I embrace it.”Listen in below.Previously, Hornsby and Vernon both appeared on the 2016 Grateful Dead covers album, Day of the Dead (Hornsby was considered a member of the Grateful Dead in the ’90s). Vernon also lent his talents to Hornsby’s track “Over the Rise”.Absolute Zero officially arrives April 12th; S. Carey, Blake Mills, and yMusic are also listed as contributors.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature which challenges artists to dig into the influences behind their newest track.Throughout the course of their 20-year career, Fujiya & Miyagi have never once forgotten their beginnings. From 2011’s Ventriloquizzing and 2014’s Artificial Sweeteners to their EP trilogy released throughout 2016 and 2017, the Brighton natives have always found a way to fold in their love of electronic music and all its sub-genres, be it electropop, disco, or even the Geramyn’s ’70s-era krautrock.For their forthcoming new album, Fujiya & Miyagi dig deeper into their roots perhaps more than ever. Aptly titled Flashback and due May 29th via Red Eye, it sees the outfit specifically engaging again with the music of their youth.The songs we loved during our adolescent years often stay with us for decades, or even our entire lives, almost like beautiful scars. (Please ask me about the five years I spent religiously worshipping at the Church of Pop Punk; I guarantee you I still remember every Drive-Thru Records song, word for word like a hymn.) Fujiya & Miyagi capture this almost spell-like experience on the new album’s lead single, also dubbed “Flashback”.“Flashback rattling round my eardrum/ It’s a psychological phenomenon/ Flashback coming from the right side of my brain/ I close my eyes and I’m transported once again,” sing Fujiya & Miyagi, “I’m in a trance, I’m in a trance, you got me caught up in a trance.” They clearly sound consumed, but they also perform a little bit of magic on their own listeners — the track’s hushed tone reveals itself to be of the hypnotic variety.In a statement to Consequence of Sound, Fujiya & Miyagi describe the new song as “a postcard sent to our younger selves.” They add, “It joins our first discoveries of different music and different cultures with every new discovery we’ve found since then and bounces back to the beginning again.”Hear it for yourself down below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Pre-orders for Flashback have already begun. In anticipation, you can also stock up on Fujiya & Miyagi’s past vinyl releases here.For a closer look at the making of “Flashback”, the electronic outfit has elaborated on the song’s other various influences, such as breakdancing and back-up vocals.Electro music:This record started life as our funk record but soon migrated closer to electro in feel. I suppose electro is funk constructed by machines. “Flashback” is like a postcard sent to our younger selves, it joins our first discoveries of different music and different cultures with every new discovery we’ve found since then and bounces back to the beginning again. I don’t think that taste gets better as you get older, and i don’t see it as a linear thing either. Every record I’ve ever loved is equally as important as the next.The art of breakdancing:Both myself & Steve grew up in satellite towns orbiting London. I think when you grow up in the suburbs you often feel outside of where the exciting things are happening, especially as a kid. Breakdancing & electro provided the background to those early teenage years. I really wanted Nike windcheaters and Adidas Shell toes. i remember other kids having those clothes and feeling jealous. It was a bit ridiculous as Hertfordshire and Essex are a long way from Queens or the Bronx. Growing up, there were a lot of poorly executed swan dives. Flashback is a snapshot of those times.The power of memories:I’m fascinated as to why some memories stick in our minds and some memories pass us by. It’s often the awkward or unhappy situations you find yourself coming back too. Flashbacks are often used in novels or films and, generally, are a slightly lazy or clumsy way to fill in a narrative or a back story. There are a few exceptions though. The flashback scenes in Nicolas Roeg’s Don’t Look Now appear as brief, occasionally jolting, glimpses, recalling the way memories often flash before us with no invitation. I like this non linear approach and try to do similar things within our songs.The complementary nature of backing vocals:I’ve always loved call & response style backing vocals, whose origins, i suppose, started with early rhythm & blues records from the 50s. You hear it through ’60s soul and ’70s funk, and it’s particularly noticeable in Velvet Underground songs, especially the VU collection that was released long after the group had split. “Flashback” backing vocals were inspired, in part, by White Light/White Heat. I like the process of taking ideas from the past and putting it into the present. Via new technologies and with a different environment, it becomes something else.Flashback Artwork:Flashback Tracklist:

"Arizona Americana act Calexico and indie folk stalwart Iron & Wine have announced their first collaborative album, Years to Burn. Due out June 14th via Sub Pop (City Slang in the EU/UK), the eight-track effort comes 14 years after Calexico’s Joey Burns and John Convertino first worked with Iron & Wine’s Sam Beam on 2005’s In the Reins EP.The trio had long desired to work together again, but timing was not in the cards until their schedules aligned last year. Armed with songs written by all three musicians, they entered Nashville’s famed Sound Emporium studio with Matt Ross-Spang for five days of recording sessions. They were joined by a number of familiar contributors, including Calexico’s trumpeter Jacob Valenzuela, pedal steel player Paul Niehaus, and Beam’s close cohorts pianist Rob Burger (Tin Hat Trio) and bassist Sebastian Steinberg (Fiona Apple)(Read: Top 21 Songs About Nostalgia)In a press release, Iron & Wine’s Beam said he was drawn back to the collaboration after “acknowledging how much impact the first record had for me in my life.” Speaking of the new LP, he added,“Life is hard. Awesome. And scary as shit. But it can lift you up if you let it. These are the things Joey and I write about now. And the title can encapsulate a lot of things. Years to Burn could mean you’re cocky, you’ve got it made. Or, our life is ours to burn, to be inspired. Or you’re burned by life, brutalized. It’s an ambiguous title, because life is complicated. Let’s not talk like teenagers about love, desire, pain, ‘cause we’re not teenagers. And that’s not a bad thing.”Lead single “Father Mountain” has been shared as a first taste of Years to Burn, and you can listen in below.Pre-orders for Years to Burn are going on now, and you can find the cover art and tracklist ahead.

"This May marks the release of Father of the Bride, the long-awaited new album from Vampire Weekend. On Wednesday, the indie rock vets promoted the LP with a live session on Steve Lamacq’s BBC Radio 6 show, featuring singles like “Harmony Hall”, “Sunflower”, and “2021”.It turns out Vampire Weekend also recorded a BBC Live Lounge set recently, in which they played “Sunflower” — that is, the Post Malone original taken from the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack. Post Malone’s “Sunflower”, featuring Swae Lee of Rae Sremmurd, is nothing like Vampy Weeks’ Father of the Bride cut, but still proved to be a rather fascinating choice for a cover song. As Stereogum point out, Ezra Koenig & co. also managed to slip in a few guitar melodies from their own “Sunflower” and “Harmony Hall” into the rendition.(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)Hear the cover for yourself below. Check out the entire BBC Live Lounge session, which featured a brief chat with the group, here.Father of the Bride, the follow-up to 2013’s Modern Vampires of the City, officially lands in stores May 3rd.

"The Belgian trio Brutus are back with their sophomore album, Nest, on March 29th, and the band has teamed up with Heavy Consequence to bring you the exclusive premiere of the new track “Django” (listen below).“Django” starts out with a pounding drum beat from singer-drummer Stefanie Mannaerts, who then delivers a powerful roar over a robust riff from guitarist Stijn Vanhoegaerden, making for an anthemic track from beginning to end. Regarding the song, the band tells us, “‘Django’ represents all the people we’ve hurt in a personal way, but who we never wanted to hurt for longer than just a few seconds. The story takes place in the Far West and is our version of a Western soundtrack, inspired by Italian composer Enio Morricone, Twin Peaks and Duane Eddy.”Brutus, who are rounded out by bassist Peter Mulders, have been garnering praise since releasing their debut album, Burst, in 2017. One of their biggest fans is Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich, who has championed the band and played their music on his Apple Music Beats 1 radio show.The trio’s music combines elements of post-rock, hardcore, metal, and even pop to form a truly unique sound, which is even more dynamic in a live setting. Below the stream of “Django”, you’ll find a clip of the band performing another new song, “War”, to give you a sense of Brutus’ live performance.The new album, Nest — which is being released via Hassle Records in Europe, and via Sargent House in North America and the rest of the world — is available for pre-order at this location.Brutus kick off a run of European dates on April 26th at the Groezrock festival in their home country of Belgium, with shows scheduled through mid-August.

"Australian producer Flume (aka Harley Streten) has dropped a new mixtape called Hi This Is Flume, marking his first collection of new music since his Grammy-winning 2016 LP Skin. The Los Angeles-based musician accompanied the effort with a visualizer created by friend, visual artist, and fellow Aussie Jonathan Zawada.In addition to a dozen solo tracks, the new mix sports a handful of collaborations from a wide range of special guests. Baltimore rapper JPEGMAFIA is featured on “How To Build A Relationship,” while slowthai spits verses on “High Beams,” which was co-produced with HWLS. Kučka, who was featured on Flume’s 2017 release “Hyperreal”, reunites with the producer on “Voices” alongside Scottish DJ and singer-songwriter SOPHIE. Notably, Streten also drew from SOPHIE’s debut LP last year, Oil of Every Pearl’s Un-Insides, teaming with Eprom for a remix of “Is It Cold In The Water?”. Eprom also co-created the album’s final song, “Spring”.Zawada’s visual for Hi This Is Flume spans 42 minutes, pairing the mixtape with striking visuals that draw from the natural world and urban environments. Much of the extended clip follows the producer traveling on deserted roads and exploring the desert, with occasional cuts to empty highways and run-down gas stations. Watch for yourself or stream the new effort below.Earlier today, Flume was announced to play Lollapalooza in August.Hi This Is Flume Artwork:Hi This Is Flume Tracklist:

"Sweden’s Amon Amarth will return with their 11th full-length album, Berserker, on May 3rd via Metal Blade. The follow-up to the 2016’s conceptual Jomsviking will include 12 tracks, and the band has shared the music video for the heavy lead single, “Raven’s Flight”, which has a deeper, sludgier sound compared to the melodic metal of their previous album.The video was directed by Roboshobo and is the first in a trilogy that romanticizes a night on the road for Amon Amarth. During this first chapter, the band pulls up the venue for an eventful soundcheck that literally evokes images of Valhalla and Norse mythology. What begins as a performance video — drummer Jocke Wallgren’s Viking ship drum riser is a highlight — ends with flashbacks to epic war sequences and the tale of the ‘Berserkers’, with ex-UFC fighter Josh Barnett as “The Beserker” and WWE wrestler Erick Rowan as “Thor”. The to-be-continued ending hints at further singles and videos to complete the trilogy and further expands the lore behind the band.Beserker was recorded in Los Angeles with Jay Ruston (Anthrax, Stone Sour) producing and engineering. To perfect the recordings and their performances, Amon Amarth recorded numerous professional demos of the songs with Peter Tägtgren and then later with Ruston himself prior to laying down the tracks properly in L.A. The result is “Amon Amarth 2.0” said vocalist Johan Hegg. “Raven’s Flight” has a driving low end and a death-metal vocal style that recalls the band’s older material, with Ruston’s production there to capture the performances in all their heaviness.“I think what we’ve done here is give ourselves the space to explore other parts of our musicality and who we are as a band,” Hegg said. “If you’re content with where you’re at, what’s the point of continuing? We always want to come up with new ideas and find new ways of doing things and to create bigger and better shows and really try to improve every aspect of what the band is.”Hegg added: “We want to try to keep growing and to do this for as long as we have the possibility to do so, because this is the best fucking job in the world.”Pre-orders for Berserker are available here.Berserker Artwork:Berserker Tracklist:

"Late last year, Morrissey announced plans for a covers album titled, California Son. The Smiths frontman offered more details about the record in February, confirming its release on May 24th via Etienne. Now, the singer has previewed the work with a new single.The 12-track effort finds Moz teaming with an array of artists — including Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, Broken Social Scene’s Ariel Engle, Petra Haden, and others — to cover artists ranging from Bob Dylan to Carly Simon and Phil Ochs. Following up his take on Roy Orbison’s 1964 hit single “It’s Over” last month, Morrissey has today unveiled his collaboration with Ed Droste of Grizzly Bear, a take on glam rock legend Jobriath aka Bruce Wayne Campbell’s “Morning Starship”.(Read: Ranking Every Song by The Smiths from Worst to Best)The new rendition of the 1973 number is slightly more psychedelic in its production, offering a fuller, electronic-tinged sound that updates it for the 21st century. Still, the song in essence remains true to its inspiration, closely mirroring its original form and melody. Perhaps the most striking difference is the use of harmonies, with backing vocals taking cues from Grizzly Bear’s own catalog and featured more heavily in the mix.Listen to Morrisey and Droste’s cover and the original “Morning Starship” below.In February, Morrissey revealed he would return to Canada for his first tour of the country in over 15 years. At the start of the month, he also announced a seven-date Broadway residency at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater in New York City during May. You can get tickets to all his dates here.The singer also recently released a deluxe edition of his 2017 album, Low in High School.

"Mavis Staples has announced her 12th solo studio album. Entitled We Get By, it’s due out on May 10th through ANTI- Records.We Get By serves as the follow-up to 2017’s If All I Was Was Black, which was written and produced by Wilco frontman and frequent collaborator Jeff Tweedy. This time, Staples has teamed up with Ben Harper, who composed 11 original tracks meant to offer “love, hope, and history during a politically divided era.”Appropriately, Staples looked to famed American photographer and civil rights documentarian Gordon Parks in creating the album’s cover. The powerful visual is part of a 1956 photo essay published in Life titled, “The Restraints: Open and Hidden”, which focused on exposing the effects of American racial segregation. In 2017, Staples won the Gordon Parks Foundation Award in recognition of her inspiring and creative body of work.(Read: Protest Music Disappeared in a Year of Protests)As a first listen of We Get By, Staples and Harper have released “Change”, a defiant blues number, characterized by an easy swing, rockin’ rhythmic guitar, and gospel-inspired harmonies. Throughout the song, the legendary singer frankly assess the state of freedom in the US with poignant commentary on shootings. In the number, she belts, “What good is freedom/ If we haven’t learned to be free?”, frequently punctuating her ideas with the energized refrain of “We got to change/ Around here/ Say it loud/ Say it clear.”Listen to the track below, and pre-order We Get By here.

"As if we needed more proof of Lizzo’s meteoric rise, she’s now back with the stamp of approval from a hip-hop legend. Her new song “Tempo”, the latest taste of the forthcoming Cuz I Love You, features an enthusiastic appearance from the Misdemeanor herself, Missy Elliott.The slapping ’90s beat is perfect for Missy, which is exactly what Lizzo thought when she first heard the track. “I was like, ‘I hope she blesses me with a verse,'” the “Boys” artist told Beats 1’s Travis Mills of reaching out to the iconic rapper. “Like, you never know, you send it to your idols, you never know if they gonna send it back.”(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Hip-Hop Albums of 2019)Send it back she did, adding bars like “Ice on my neck like brrr/ I’m big-boned with nice curves/ Look at me, I know I look grrrd.” Her lyrics fall right in line with the thick girl anthem that has Lizzo spitting on the chorus, “Slow song, they for skinny hoes/ Can’t move all of this here to one of those/ I’m a thick bitch, I need tempo.”Listen to “Tempo” below.“Tempo” follows the throwback party bopper “Juice” and the stunning ballad “Cuz I Love You”, with all three tracks well summarizing Lizzo’s breadth of talent.

"Cate Le Bon has announced a new album, Reward, her first release through new label home Mexican Summer. Due out May 24th, the effort follows last year’s Hippo Lite from Le Bon’s collaboration with Tim Presley DRINKS, as well as her 2016 solo LP Crab Day.Marking Le Bon’s fifth solo full-length, Reward came together during a year of solitary living in the Lakes Distrcit of UK. While her days were spent teaching herself woodworking by building tables and chairs from scratch, her days found her “going a little bit crazy and playing the piano to [herself] and singing into the night.” That piano happened to be an old Meers, the first she ever owned.Co-produced by Samur Khouja, the 10-track record features contributions from Stella Mozgawa of Warpaint and H.Hawkine. Speaking of the title in a press release, Le Bon said,“People hear the word ‘reward’ and they think that it’s a positive word, and to me it’s quite a sinister word in that it depends on the relationship between the giver and the receiver. I feel like it’s really indicative of the times we’re living in where words are used as slogans, and everything is slowly losing its meaning.”As a first listen, the Welsh singer-songwriter has shared “Daylight Matters”.

"After revealing late last year that he was working on a solo album, and releasing the single “Tenderness” last month, Guns N’ Roses bassist Duff McKagan has announced full details of the LP, which is titled Tenderness, and will arrive on May 31st. In addition, he has unveiled a new song, “Chip Away” (listen below).“‘Chip Away’ is somewhat of a rail against cable news and divisive agendas… all for the almighty dollar,” said McKagan in a press release. “The song also highlights the fact that history repeats itself over and over, says that we will all get past this, together.”As previously reported, Tenderness is being produced by Shooter Jennings. The album contains 11 tracks, with both “Tenderness” and “Chip Away” available as instant downloads when the LP is pre-ordered at this location. (While you’re at it, grab some more McKagan releases on vinyl here.)A limited edition 40-page deluxe book, complete with the album on 180-gram yellow-and-red starburst vinyl, the CD, and an exclusive lithograph numbered and signed by McKagan is also available. The book contains photos from the recording sessions and notes from McKagan detailing each song on the album.Following a special April 4th performance and Q&A at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, McKagan will be backed by Jennings and his band for a US tour beginning May 30th in Philadelphia.

"When a band drops a “Vol. 1,” it’s fair enough to expect a follow-up. Thankfully, Broken Social Scene are coming through on that eponymic promise. After releasing their Let’s Try the After – Vol. 1 EP last month, the Canadian indie rockers have now announced Let’s Try the After – Vol. 2. It’s due out on April 12th via Arts & Crafts Records.As a first listen to the new EP, BSS have shared “Can’t Find My Heart”, a driving track with reverberating textures swirling around indie Americana rhythms. Speaking of the song in a press release, band co-founder Kevin Drew said,“The theme is to continue. Sickness, suicide, uprise, love, death, betrayal, hurt, joy, sex, communication, battles and divisions… Let’s just get to their after and start building again. How do we do it within the isolation of self prescribe empty popularity? How does the ego revolt? How does the heart win? Can it? Maybe after we will find out.”Take a listen below. Vol. 2 will also be available alongside Vol. 1 in an exclusive vinyl package for Record Store Day a day later on the 13th.Let’s Try the After Vol. 2 Artwork:Let’s Try the After Vol. 2 Tracklist:

"It’s been nearly eight years since the last album from Dub Trio, the three-piece dub-metal pioneers whose members have studio and performing credits with mega stars such as Lady Gaga, Matisyahu, The Fugees, Mos Def, and Common. Now, the group is back with a new single and video, “Fought the Line”, featuring Mastodon singer-bassist Troy Sanders, and it’s premiering right here on Heavy Consequence.The track appears on Dub Trio’s forthcoming album, The Shape of Dub to Come (due April 26th), which features the band expanding their effects-driven, groove-based alt-metal, allowing more space for echoing, reverberating dub effects to slither and dissipate. They also bring in a handful of high-profile guests, including Sanders, guitarist-singer Buzz Osborne (Melvins) on the previously released track “World of Inconvenience”, and soulful singer-songwriter Meshell Ndegeocello.“Fought the Line” (watch the video below) opens with a somber, melodic clean riff before introducing Sanders’ raspiness and a mid-tempo sludge groove. The creepy, script-flipping video speaks to the song’s heavy lyrical theme.Regarding the track, Sanders says, “‘Fought the Line’ references struggle. It comes from a poem that I wrote inspired by a conversation I had with cancer itself. I stared at a face of beautiful, soft skin and assured this face, ‘I will take care of you.’ We’re fighting one battle together. I’m right there, if things fall into my hands. The verses were therapy venting my anger. When people are fighting for their lives, it’s very easy to go off the line. If death is reeling you in, then you have to fight and do anything in your power to overcome it. I just wanted to be there to support.”Sanders revealed in October 2015 that his wife, Jeza, was diagnosed with breast cancer.Dub Trio — comprised of Stu Brooks, DP Holmes, Joe Tomino — will be touring the East Coast in May, with more dates to be announced soon.

"Purveyors of extreme grind Full of Hell have announced a new album, Weeping Choir, out May 17th via Relapse Records. The Maryland quartet’s first LP for the label is teased as being their most “explosive album to date,” and the lead single, “Burning Myrrh”, reinforces that statement with its crushing drums and organized chaos — watch the music video directed by Cody Stauder below.The album was produced by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou at his GodCity Studio in Massachusetts. From the earliest incarnations of the group, band members Dylan Walker and Spencer Hazard have calculated a sound that bridges power-electronics with extreme metal and hardcore, with live performances that are as manic as their music.In an interview last year with Blessed Altar Zine, Walker addressed Full of Hell being labeled as a “powerviolence” band, but shrugged off any discontent at being mislabeled.“We definitely don’t define ourselves as a PV band at all,” Walker said. “We love the style and take influence from it, but it was never a label we used. We try to be casual about the genre labeling though. We don’t care what label people put on us, especially because no matter what genre you’re tagged with there will be people angry that you’re being labeled as such. It doesn’t matter. We are a band.”Throughout numerous splits and collaborative recording projects with artists like Merzbow and The Body, along with the contributions of band members Dave Bland and Sam DiGristine, Full of Hell have picked up cues and ideas from their interaction with likeminded musicians. “Burning Myrrh” indicates that Weeping Choir will be as brutal and complex as anything they’ve ever written.In support of the album, Full of Hell will headline a North American tour with labelmates Primitive Man and Genocide Pact starting May 24th with an appearance at Maryland Deathfest. It will be a busy run for the band, who will also depart on a European co-headling tour with The Body beginning July 4th at the Roskilde Festival, with collaborative sets between the two bands also scheduled.

"Chicago rapper Ric Wilson busted out of the Young Chicago Authors (see, Chance the Rapper, Vic Mensa, Jamila Woods, Saba) with last year’s BANBA EP. Now, ahead of his first-ever tour, the rising MC has dropped a pair of new tracks, “Yellowbrick” and “Dan Ryan”.The former song opens as a swaying R&B number before switching to a snappy hip-hop bop. During both sections, Wilson sings, “It’s the vibes that you bringing around/ The way that you smile/ You holdin’ me down/ That’s the yellowbrick road to my love.” ” As the lyricist tells Consequence of Sound, “I wanted to make a song about love, a song that reminded of the rom coms I watched when I was younger with happy endings. No one sings about love any more.”Check it out:“Dan Ryan”, meanwhile, takes its name from the expressway that cuts down the center of South Side Chicago. Passing cars take the listener into Wilson’s “thoughts in my car when I’m in rush hour Dan Ryan construction traffic,” scored by daydreaming piano notes. Take a listen below.The songs are in advance of Wilson’s US tour, which kicks off at Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho on March 23rd.

"Origins is a recurring new music feature where musicians are presented with the opportunity to explore the influences that led them to their latest song.Bobby Oroza is on the verge of breaking through. With his debut single, “This Love”, the Finnish up-and-comer established himself as an underground hitmaker, with the silky tune becoming an anthem among soul enthusiasts and eventually getting a nod from Earl Sweatshirt on his track “Hat Trick”. On May 3rd, the R&B vocalist will release his highly anticipated debut album, This Love, via Big Crown Records. In support of the forthcoming LP, Oroza has today dropped a second song off the album, “Deja Vu”, and shared its Origins.Oroza is simultaneously timeless and contemporary, as his sound is the unique product of his diverse roots. Born in Helsinki, Finland, he draws inspiration internationally, synthesizing his Bolivian grandfather’s Latin and Cuban guitar playing with his parent’s love of early jazz, Motown, gospel, and doo-wop. Add into the mix tastes of folk traditions from around the world, a dash of Nuyorican salsa, plus his early travels to Cuba to study percussion and singing, and you’ll find the wide-ranging foundation on which Oroza’s music is built.“Deja Vu” continues this lineage, offering a soulful ballad reminiscent of the crooners of the ’40s and ’50s. Produced by Timmion Records’ famed duo Cold Diamond & Mink and supported by the label’s tight house band, the song delights with its lo-fi leanings and brooding vibe, though remains fresh with the juxtaposition of crisp drums against unhurried guitar licks and atmospheric orchestral flourishes.Oroza explained the inspiration behind the the track:“‘Deja Vu’ tells of the moment of realization in a relationship when there are no means left to reignite the fire. It’s when you understand something fundamental about yourself and the other. After a blind cycle of repetitious situations where needs are not met, communication fails and frustration builds, the truth finally hits you. The force that’s been pulling you away subconsciously for some time, now sends you drifting back in to space. There’s pain for sure, but you know whats up.”Listen for yourself below.Oroza has shared with us the Origins of “Deja Vu”, outlining a few of the varied influences that helped shape the number. Read on below.The Naked Sun by Isaac Asimov:A man suffering from intense agoraphobia encounters a woman who at first is repelled by the idea of personal contact and face-to-face interaction. This sci-fi classic has a gloomy prophetic air to it. It deals with alienation in societies and the barriers of communication and opposing needs between individuals.“Tapestry from an Asteroid” – Sun Ra:Sun Ra took the harmony furthest without ever becoming academic or intellectual. He took music to space but kept it so profoundly human and sensitive. His music is beautiful and like for the imaginary and mythology he himself built around it, it is a strong provoker of personal visions and storylines for me.“Dream Walking” – Imogen Cunningham:A master photographer. Her work is often gently twisting reality and creating other worldly vibes but it’s pierced with deep humaneness. Im fixated with this approach. Surrealism is highlighting the human experience for me.Roland RE-201 Space Echo:This tape echo device never ceases to inspire. Roland Corporation has produced a plethora of analogue effects units and instruments that are still widely used. Many things are right here. In the first demo of “Deja Vu”, we had the drums leaking heavily into the vocal mic running through a Space Echo unit. The harmonics created were weird and strong and set the direction for the whole production of the song.To promote the new record, Oroza will team with veteran soul singer Lee Fields & The Expressions this spring with a number of European dates in April and May. The Finnish rising star plans to tour the United States in the fall, and you can find tickets here.Bobby Oroza 2019 Tour Dates:

"On the one-year anniversary of Dolores O’Riordan’s death, The Cranberries announced their eighth and final studio album, In the End. Due out on April 26th via BMG, the forthcoming LP was produced by longtime collaborator Stephen Street and features previous singles “All Over Now” and “The Pressure”. Today, the Irish rockers are back with another sample of the LP, “Wake Me When It’s Over”.The laidback number is built around a demo O’Riordan recorded, with the band working with Street to layer sounds around her distinctive voice for a classic Cranberries tune. Describing the song in a press release, the band’s Noel Hogan said, “It’s a fun song to play and it’s bright and quite uplifting. It’s very much a classic Dolores song with a soft verse and a massive chorus.”Take a listen below.In the End was largely recorded prior to O’Riordan death, with the group moving forward with its release as a way to honor their frontwoman. Explained Noel Hogan,“We knew this had to be one of the, if not the, best Cranberries album that we could possibly do. The worry was that we would destroy the legacy of the band by making an album that wasn’t up to standard. Once we had gone through all the demos that Dolores and I had worked on and decided that we had such a strong album we knew it would be the right thing and the best way that we could honour Dolores.”The effort follows The Cranberries’ 2017 album, Something Else, and last fall’s 25th anniversary reissue of Everybody Else is Doing It, So Why Can’t We?.

"Tierra Whack has been teaching fans about #WhackHistoryMonth over the last five weeks, sharing a new song every Tuesday. Things kicked off on February 19th with “Only Child”, followed by “Clones”, “Gloria”, and “Wasteland”. Today, she’s back with what is expected to be the last release in the series, “Unemployed”.The track is 100% dexterity, as the rising Philadelphia MC hits bopping bar after bopping bar. “Not on my level/ Not on your tippy-toes,” she spits at one point, and with cuts like this, it’s hard to argue. Take a listen below.Whack made her late-night TV debut earlier this month with an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.",articles40,"['Tuesday', 'Today']"
"Origins is a recurring new music feature where musicians are given the opportunity to unwrap the influences behind their latest track.Mark Mulcahy has today announced his sixth solo studio album, The Gus. Due out on June 7th via Mezzotint, The Gus follows up 2017’s The Possum in the Driveway and the celebrated Miracle Legion and Polaris frontman’s  2013 return record, Dear Mark J. Mulcahy, I Love You.For the ten-track collection, the singer-songwriter was inspired by George Saunders’ short fiction, pushing the acclaimed artist to “up his lyrical game” and further embrace his role as a storyteller. Mulcahy and producer Marc Seedorf originally conceived the project as an experiment centered around making an album entirely with strangers. After abandoning those plans, the duo instead turned to frequent collaborator Ken Maiuri, eventually securing an impressive list of guests including Rain Phoenix, Dinosaur Jr.’s J Mascis, Mates of State’s John Panos, and others. Recorded at the main studio and library at Barnhouse Recordings, the process became “an exploration,” frequently foregoing recording for “read and swim sessions.”Explains Mulcahy,“Wasted time with a purpose. Waiting for somebody to come with an idea. People would come by just to read. Then we started getting out of there. We recorded some piano at J’s, the cello at the Unitarian church, Rain did her tracks in LA, then down to New Haven for obvious reasons.  One day it was done. We could just tell. All the words fit. We had a cast party, listened, laughed, and cried. Soon it was mixed and mastered and voila, The Gus!”“Taking Baby Steps” marks the first single off the forthcoming record, highlighting the Mulcahy’s masterful lyricism and elegant songwriting. His voice is at the center of it all, offering wavering falsetto, rhythmic chants, and whispered harmonies alongside the number’s soulful and more straightforward rock-inspired verses. The track comes accompanied by a music video directed by Jason Mazzotta, which features Mulcahy and fellow musician Andy Goulet in a buddy comedy of sorts. In the clip, the duo is handcuffed together as they traverse the countryside, play tennis, and share ice cream.Check out the touching visual below.To complement the release, Mulcahy has shared the Origins of “Taking Baby Steps”, offering a glimpse into a few images that inspired the track. Check his thoughts out below.Making Things Up: I like to make up things about real people. Sometimes it’s just a grudge that hangs around and I need to make something out of it or give it up. Maybe there’s some satisfaction in setting that resentment to music or maybe turning that bad apathy to at least solicitude. I’d rather talk about the thing I love, but this time I didn’t.Maine… or Maybe Cape Cod:I was standing on some rocks, close to where the waves smash. It’s a game of come and go. I was counting the intervals, trying to avoid getting crashed. I found the in-between is like the pulse of the baby steps, real herky-jerky. In the studio, it had everybody confused where the one was. I’m a thrill seeker.The Holyoke Merry-Go-Round:Crazy, old, frightened wooden horses and maniacal mechanical Sousa music cranked. I don’t hardly ever go on the thing, but I’m there all the time. You just listen and get into the demented way. I wish it was open all night.Tuxedoes:They hardly ever get a chance. All that’s left for them are proms, and I’m not even sure about that. It’s amazing you can just rent one. Anytime you want one. But will you? Getting dressed up is good, getting all dressed up is better, and for that, you need to go to Don’s Formals and pick out something nice. Dark brown, powder blue, it’s not important. A ruffled shirt, cuff links, and a swash of plaid cummerbund is the yellow brick road to joy. All your troubles will turn to stardust.You can check out the artwork and tracklist for The Gus below.

"Chicago R&B goddess Jamila Woods is set to release her sophomore album, LEGACY! LEGACY!, on May 10th. Having previously previewed the 13-track LP with “Giovanni” and “Zora”, Woods has now unveiled a third teaser in “Eartha”.Each of the songs featured on LEGACY! LEGACY! is named after a person who’s made an impression on Woods over the course of her young life. In the case of “Eartha”, it’s “inspired by the badass spirit and wisdom” of singer, actress, activist, and author Eartha Kitt.Woods says of the song in a statement,“‘Who gonna share my love for me with me?’ These are the thoughts that play in your head after an argument with your partner. These are the pages you write in your journal the next morning. This is everything you wish you could have said, or everything you’ve said a million times without it being heard. The moment you realize you are worthy of more.”Take a listen below.Woods embarks on a supporting North American tour beginning in May.

"Lust for Youth are following up their 2016 album Compassion with a new self-titled LP. Due out on June 7th via Sacred Bones, the Danish duo have previewed the collection with lead single “Great Concerns”.Lust for Youth will add eight tracks to the project’s dance-driven and pop-inspired catalog. Since 2014’s International, Hannes Norrvide and Malthe Fischer have been refining their vision and drawing on the rich musical culture of their hometown of Copenhagen. The forthcoming LP promises that the duo have taken “some familiar strides, though to another place,” reimagining their past “disaffected balearia… into brighter pop compositions that bustle with intricate production.”Explains a press release,“No longer galvanizing us with hooks, but with a songcraft unhindered by anxiety, the album presents a cohesion not seen in the project until now. Lyrically, the apprehension still hangs like tinsel. Often garish and celebratory, the droll mischief is this time more pointed, more personal, and far more self-aware. A thread of reflections upon the state of the world is artfully wound throughout the album, casting a quiet force upon the detachment of Norrvide’s vocals.”Lust for Youth’s newest single, “Great Concerns”, highlights this new development, melding their more austere sensibilities with buoyant pop leanings. The tone of the song is hard to pin down, opening with an ambient instrumental introduction before settling into the grinding beat of the tune. While at times dark, the number surprises, interspersing brief shimmering synth interludes throughout the otherwise propulsive and heavy track.You can pre-order the record here and stream “Great Concerns” below.",articles40,"['Youth', 'Youth', 'Youth’s']"
"Michigan rockers I Prevail have unleashed a music video for their new song “Paranoid”, which will arrive on their upcoming sophomore album, Trauma.The song is the third to drop off the metalcore band’s new album — the previous two being “Bow Down” and “Breaking Down” — and deals with the difficult topic of mental health.The clip depicts frontman Brian Burkheiser as a surgeon who mistakenly takes the wrong medicine and goes ahead with his duties despite being completely out of sorts. Watch the full video below.Trauma will arrive on March 29th via Fearless Records, and can be pre-ordered via this link. It’s the band’s first album since Burkheiser underwent surgery for a vocal polyp, and themes deal with “the aftershocks of stress and anxiety” he went through at that time.“After my vocal injury, I almost gave up and left my band. I was in the worst mental state of my life and felt like everything we worked for was over,” he stated on Instagram last month.He added, “Early last year though, I told myself that if we were going to get back and write another record it needed to be done OUR WAY. No label telling us who to work with, or what our music should sound like. No negativity coming in from outside sources. No cookie cutter BS. Just us and our producer @tylersmyth making songs that came from a place of 100% authenticity.”In addition to the new album, I Prevail will embark on a headlining North American tour with support from Issues and Justin Stone.

"The release of Devin Townsend’s new album EMPATH is just weeks away, promising an amalgamation of heavy styles and musical exploration from the Canadian artist. Townsend has dropped a new single from the album, “Evermore”, along with an accompanying music video featuring a spacefaring cat that spends too much time on its phone and crash lands on a spooky planet Degobah-style (watch below).The song is indicative of the chameleon-like metal of EMPATH, with moments of massive orchestral prog and full choir arrangements opening up to spacious passages where Townsend’s clean vocals and guitar-work take precedence. The album traverses many of the songwriter’s various styles, essentially creating a genre unto himself for this record, which he credits to a free-form approach rather than pandering to any commercial expectation.“Those interested in the more artistic and free form side of what I do really seem to like and understand it, and those looking for the more commercial or rocking side of what I do are maybe not so convinced,” Townsend said of the reception toward the new material. “The album is meant to be of some help in a weird way.”Those who are curious of Townsend’s creative process can get an inside look, as he will be posting a series of “documentary episodes recorded as phone conversations” during the making of the album. The first episode can be seen here.EMPATH is out March 29th via InsideOut Records with CD and vinyl pre-orders now available. You can also catch Devin Townsend on tour with Avatar this spring. See the dates here, and pick up tickets here.EMPATH Tracklist:

"As anticipation builds for the new Deftones album, singer Chino Moreno keeps popping up on new songs outside of the band. The latest track comes from his supergroup Saudade, and features guest vocals from Chelsea Wolfe.Saudade is a supergroup comprised of Moreno, guitarist Dr. Know (Bad Brains), keyboardist John Medeski (Medeski Martin & Wood), bassist Chuck Doom (of Moreno’s band Crosses), and drummer Gil Sharone (Team Sleep). Dr. Know does not appear on this particular track, “Shadows & Light”, but it does feature veteran guitarist David Torn and percussionist Bobby Thomas (Weather Report).Wolfe — whose music can be described as gothic, doom, and folk — adds her vocals to the haunting song, which can be heard in the player below. She recently told Revolver of the track, “It’s really different from Deftones and really different than my music. It’s something special and unique.”Saudade released a self-titled single in 2016, but haven’t really been heard from until this release of the new “Shadows & Light” track, which is also available as a digital single through iTunes.Meanwhile, Moreno recently stirred up excitement for Deftones’ upcoming album when he compared the disc to 2000’s White Pony. As of yet, there’s no release date or title, but the LP is expected sometime in 2019.Moreno also appeared on a new Vowws track, “Structure of Love II”, and composed a score for an installment of Hulu’s horror series Into the Dark. The episode, titled “I’m Just F*cking With You”, premieres April 5th on the streaming service.",articles40,"['Deftones', 'Chino Moreno', 'Chelsea Wolfe', 'Dr. Know', 'Bad Brains', 'John Medeski', 'Dr. Know', 'Hulu’s']"
"Jack Antonoff has launched the third volume in his ongoing Terrible Thrills cover series. Past entires have seen female musicians reimagine albums from different points in his career; 2010’s Vol. 1 focused on his pre-fun. outfit Steel Train’s self-titled LP, while 2015’s Vol. 2 featured reworkings of Bleachers’ Strange Desire debut. Vol. 3 is being released as a series of limited edition 7-inches and consists of new versions of tracks from the most recent Bleachers album, 2017’s Gone Now.The A-side of Terrible Thrills Vol. 3 Pt. 1 hears Mitski covering “Let’s Get Married”. On Strange Desire, the track is a big, bright, bopper — ya know, a Bleachers song. Mitski rips away all the saccharine synths and thumping drums, replacing them with a gentle piano and cooing vocals. As Antonoff tweeted, this rendition actually “is how it sounded when i first wrote it.”Mitski’s “Let’s Get Married” is backed by an alternate version of Gone Now’s opening track, “Dream of Mickey Mantle”. Renamed “Mickey Mantle Comes Alive”, this new take is a shuddering bit of electro-nostalgia that’s 50/50 music and random conversation.Subscriptions toTerrible Thrills Vol. 3  have long since sold out and will never be repressed on vinyl, but Antonoff has given his OK for fans to upload the tracks and share them online. So thanks to this download link, you can stream both songs below.Mitski is currently on tour supporting the best album of 2018, Be the Cowboy. Buy tickets here.The second entry in Vol. 3 features Muna’s cover of “All My Heroes” matched with Bleacher’s “I Miss the Last Days of Disco” (a version of “I Miss Those Days”), a “Don’t Take the Money” demo, and a reworking of “Hate That You Know Me” dubbed “Hate That You Slow Me Down”. Then comes Julien Baker’s take on “Everybody Lost Somebody” b/w “Good Morning After a Breakup” (“Goodmorning”) and “Vietnam Documentary (presumably “Goodbye”). The series closes with Ani DiFranco’s “Foreign Girls” paired with “And, Nothing Is You” (“Nothing Is U”).Revisit Mitski’s episode of Kyle Meredith with… below.Listen and subscribe via iTunes | Google Play | Stitcher | RSS",articles40,"['Jack Antonoff', 'Steel Train', 'Muna’s', 'Julien Baker', 'Ani DiFranco’s']"
"Bay Area band Possessed are considered one of the originators of death metal. Their 1985 debut album, Seven Churches, is arguably the first album in the genre, even including a track bluntly titled “Death Metal”. Despite only releasing two full-lengths and an EP, they made a lasting influence during the mid-to-late ’80s, which was a fertile era for underground metal.Now, more than 30 years since their last LP, Possessed have announced that their third album, Revelations of Oblivion, will arrive May 10th via Nuclear Blast. Moreover, the band has shared the first single, the evil old-school thrasher “No More Room in Hell” (listen below).The new album comes years after the band was reformed in 2007 by founding member Jeff Becerra and members of Sadistic Intent, but the classic Possessed sound remains intact and as sinister as ever.“This album from start to release has been a fantastic experience,” Becerra said in a press release. “All of us in Possessed hope you enjoy this newest release and we look forward to touring and creating much more new music in the future.”The album was recorded at NRG Studios and Titan Studios, with Becerra acting as executive producer alongside co-producer Daniel Gonzalez. Polish artist Zbigniew Bielak created the artwork, which recalls the bleak, hellish environments of Dark Souls.Nuclear Blast has numerous editions of the album up for pre-order, including a box set that’s limited to 666 copies and includes the full album on double vinyl and CD, as well as a 2017 live performance on Blu-Ray, vinyl, and CD. The band also teased forthcoming tour dates, but nothing has been officially announced.Revelations of Oblivion Artwork:Revelations of Oblivion Tracklist:

"Origins is a recurring new music feature where musicians are dig into the influences that led to their newest track.When your world is literally in flames, it’s hard to find the bright side. Last year, millions across California saw the skies blackened and their homes lit ablaze during the deadliest wildfire season in the state’s history. Yet once the smoke dissipated, these people had no choice but to push forward, to find some hopeful prospects in the ashes.Its this idea of finding hope in the bleakest of times is what inspired the latest track from Black Pistol Fire, “Black Halo”. Stomping with the grit the garage rock duo is known for, there’s a surf-y vibe in the heavy guitar and vocal melodies, a reflection of the smoky darkness that enveloped so much of the West Coast in 2018. Though it’s not bluntly stated, there is a bit of weary hopefulness in the lyrics, cutting through like the bright riffs against the thudding drums. “Every road I go seems darker than one/ Before you get too close/ I never walk alone/ Got my shadow and a Black Halo,” goes the chorus, lines of resilience in the face of endless tribulation.Take a listen below.For more on how the track came to be, BPF have broken down the Origins of “Black Halo”. The single follows January’s “Level”, and you can also grab more of the band’s music on vinyl here.California Wildfires:“Black Halo” was inspired by the wildfires that took place in California in 2018. Written from a place of feeling helpless and heartbroken, while still trying to find something to hold on to.Smoke Above LA:The image of smoke rings or a “Black Halo”, drifting across California and finally finding a home above the city of angels, kept flashing in my brain.Silver Linings:That sparked the idea of trying to write from the perspective of someone who has lost everything, but yet still hold out hope for silver lining, even if their world is going up in flames.Banjolele:The track started out as folky stomp on the Banjolele that lived as a rough demo on my phone for months. Almost forgotten until a dark, West Coast, beachy guitar riff and some pounding drums breathed new life into the track.",articles40,['Written']
"Back in December, Jenny Lewis announced her first album in five years, On the Line. Now, following up “Red Bull & Hennessy” and “Heads Gonna Roll”, the indie folk artist has released a third single, “Wasted Youth”, before the record drops next week.Already, On the Line has generated buzz for its heavy-hitting list of collaborators. For the new song, the former Rilo Kiley leader is joined by Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers’ Benmont Tench, who plays Vox Continental and Mellotron organs on the tune. Famed studio producer Don Was also gets a nod, locking down the rhythm section on bass alongside studio drummer Jim Keltner.(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)On its surface, “Wasted Youth” is a feel-good romp through the sounds of the ’70s, tapping into the nostalgic singer-songwriter vibe of the iconic period. However, Lewis digs deeper as the track goes on, with the lyrics playfully hinting at a darker side to the sugary-sweet number. She croons, “Why are you lying?/ The bourbon’s gone/ Mercury hasn’t been in retrograde for that long.” In the chorus, she repeats, “I wasted my youth on a poppy,” before gleefully adding, “just for fun.”Take a listen for yourself below. Ahead of On the Line, stock up on more Lewis music on vinyl here.At the start of March, Lewis previewed her forthcoming collection with a star-studded and surrealist listening party, which saw cameos from Beck, Jeff Goldblum, St. Vincent, Mac DeMarco, Jim James, Natasha Leggero, and many others. Once On the Line is formally released on March 22nd, the singer will embark on an extensive tour spanning until November.

"In what is being called the largest scam in music labels ever prosecuted, wealthy parents, Hollywood actors, and actresses, and music label executives have been accused of carrying out a nationwide fraud to get music producers onto dance music's largest music labels. The scheme had a couple of major pieces. In the first part of the scam, parents allegedly paid ghost producers to write and produce Songs on behalf of their kids. Second, the organization allegedly bribed the largest music labels to help place the producer's songs on their labels, prosecutors said. Court documents also allege that some defendants created fake bios for producers to make them appear as successful music producers.In the $25 million scam, most kids said that they didn't even like the labels or dance music in the first place. The fallout was swift as many of the music labels have either fired or placed their employees on administrative leave.   ",articles9,['Court']

"Americans drink enough bottled water each week to circle the globe twice around. Due to this fact, motivated politicians in San Francisco have banded together to ban water bottles in the major metropolitan cities. Now it appears that music festivals are taking notice of this new measure. Music festivals across the globe have announced a new initiation to ban water bottles on all festival grounds. Although the National Association of Music voted unanimously to phase out the sale of single-use plastic water bottles, the rule originally was set to take place in 2025. The head of the National Association of Music declared a national state of emergency to ban all water bottles. When asked by the local media what will be used instead of single-use plastic water bottles, the board of supervisors encouraged its festival attendees to just use their shoes to drink water they get from the fountains moving forward.

"When Ultra Music Festival was forced out of the popular Bayfront Park in Miami, Beach location, the festival's organizers scrambled for a new location. After plenty of research, Ultra Music Festival landed on Virginia Beach only to find out another festival would be taking place the same weekend as well as the popular bike ride, Critical Mass.

"As we see hundreds of today's best artists head to Miami, Florida to perform at Ultra Music Festival, what better time than now to relive one of the most defining moments for the late Avicii. In 2013, Avicii shocked the world by introducing his brand new sound at the main stage during Ultra Music Festival. While the set originally received quite a bit of mixed reviews, the set has truly defined Avicii in his boldness to step out of the norm and produce what he had truly loved. Watch and relive the iconic set from the late DJ and producer. ",articles9,[None]
"It definitely sounded too good to be true when we first heard this hot bit of gossip, and sure enough – it has been officially debunked (for now?). After a rush of excitement around a new collaboration between ZHU and Disclosure, ZHU has stepped up and explained – at this point in time, no such project exists. This is obviously unfortunate as the mixture of Disclosure's out of the box, generational melding style of groove, and ZHU's masterful dark mysterious beats would be truly captivating. While there is still not explanation on how this rumor got started, we will keep an eye out for more updates as they become available. Still, even if ZHU x Disclosure is not a thing, we are sure to be hearing dozens of new collaborations from artists all across the dance music spectrum this coming weekend at Ultra Music Festival. Stay tuned for full and comprehensive coverage of the event, starting this Friday.

"Eric Prydz is a true mainstay of Miami Music Week. From his landmark performances at Ultra to his warehouse parties under his Cirez D alias, Prydz has continually raised the bar in both production and music during EDM's most important week. That is why Miami Music Week is going to be lacking a little bit of magic in 2019.Eric Prydz took to Twitter yesterday to explain that due to an acute medical condition, he was forced to cancel all his MMW appearances as he is unable to travel. This is incredibly unfortunate for fans, but in a day and age where the overall health of artists is paramount, we are so happy to see Eric taking self-care measures and not pushing himself. His event with Adam Beyer at the Wynwood Factory has been canceled. To make up for the shock, the venue is issuing refunds and free admission before midnight at all other show's during the week for all ticket holders. We hope Prydz gets better soon!I am really sorry but due to an acute medical condition I am unable to travel or perform in Miami this week. I am truly gutted to miss any shows but especially Miami as this is one of my favourite times of the year.— Eric Prydz (@ericprydz) ",articles9,['Eric Prydz']

"Just like the last few years, Pasquale Rotella just used the Night Owl Radio show to debut the EDC Las Vegas lineup in the form of several mega-mini-mixes. For those not in the know, Rotella combines a few seconds from artist's songs and mixes them into 3-4 minute mixes for each stage. It is up to fans to identify artists based off of only a few moments of their music. Obviously, it is impossible for any ONE individual to pull off alone. Even having worked in dance music for nearly a decade…I was only able to identify maybe 50 artists from the immense amount of track snippets played over the course of the hour. Lucky for us, Reddit exists. In brilliant nature, the sub /r/Electricdaisycarnival crowdsourced the track identification and created the most comprehensive list of artists from the lineup debut show I can find.

"One of the most anticipated storylines in the world of EDM this year is Skrillex returning with new music. While the producer has not been taking a break by any means, he has been working to produce for other artists rather than release under his own name for the past year or so. As 2018 began to wrap up, it was clear that Skrillex had several different new projects in the work. Artists all across dance music began hinting that Skrillex was working on original tunes once again, and then over the course of a few weeks, Skrillex was spotted in the studio with Boys Noize several times. This was the tipping point for the rumor mill around the return of Dog Blood. Sure enough, by the end of the year, the comeback of the supergroup was solidified when Buku announced their 2019 featuring none other than Skrillex's and Boys Noize's spectacular side project. This past weekend Dog Blood took to the stage for the first time in quite some time. While the duo has popped up here and there over the last several years, this was one of the first sets where new music could be identified. Lucky for us, one fan caught the first several minutes of the set – and they sound absolutely bonkers.

In short, we never really know what to expect from these guys. Over the weekend SLANDER debuted a new tune alongside Gryffin. Without even hearing this tune, we already knew it was going to be something special. Between SLANDER's incredible production ability, and Gryffin's almost inhuman ability to produce memorable melodies, this was a match made in heaven. Sure enough, this song sounds pretty gorgeous.

"I know many years ago when I was in high school, Deadmau5's first essential mix helped open my eyes to the brilliant world of dance music that existed just outside my knowledge. I still get goosebumps to this day, when I think of the closing line of the opening monologue – THE MAU5 SOUNDS LIKE THIS. It has been a long time coming for Deadmau5 to return to the essential mix decks. While Joel has of course been featured on Radio 1 many times since that debut mix over a decade ago, his return to Pete Tong's hallowed grounds marks something special. Just as Tong explains as he introduces him, Deadmau5 has been a busy man. Programming his new live show, scheduling a world tour, releasing new music, running a label, and getting himself into all sorts of trouble along the way, is enough to run anyone ragged. For Joel though, its just another day in the life. He still found the time to compile a two hour mix – one hour focusing on his techno alias Testpilot, and the other focusing on his classic Deadmau5 sound. Jump in below and enjoy the madness of this gorgeous mix, you won't regret it. Stay tuned for the debut of the cube 3.0 at Ultra this coming weekend. ",articles9,['Pete Tong']

"As one of the most esteemed dance music duos of their time, W&amp;W are looked up to by many up-and-coming acts and promising talents. In turn, the Dutchmen always seem to be willing to support fresh talent wherever they go, and their new release on their Rave Culture label fits the same bill. A collaboration with rising star Maurice West, who had already turned into a regular on W&W’s label,  is a perfect example of the quality stuff you get when established names team up with exciting prospects.Easily as sensational as slow-mo bullet dodging, is the first collaboration between W&W and Maurice West, and a monster tune like no other.

"Today marks the beginning of Miami Music Week. Which means Ultra Music Festival is only a few short days away. It has sure been a bumpy road this past year for the United States' premiere dance music festival. After being ousted from its near decade long home of Bay Front Park, Ultra was forced to relocate mere months before it was set to take place. Even after finding a new home, things continued to cause issues all over the place. After additional lawsuits from other events, as well as residents,  were filed and subsequently thrown out, Ultra finally had a clear path forward. In a way, Ultra's temultuous off-season paints a picture of the resilient nature of the dance music industry. We may bend, but we will never break. Now, with just days before Ultra opens its doors at its debut event on Virginia Key, we are starting to see the incredible new main stage for 2019. It looks quite similar to 2016's main stage, which was a fan and industry favorite. Check it out below, if you don't mind spoiling the surprise.  from  from ",articles9,[]

The cop is known for performing fake arrests in popular YouTube videos. So, it's easy to say that this was some sort of publicity stunt for the artist.Now, we're just wondering if the fans were mad their show got cut off.Malaa just got arrested mid-set in San Diego! — tori (@toristuht) MALAA JUST GOT ARRESTED Wtf  — Cookie Rojas 🍪 (@Vjordan_58) What do you think this could be a publicity stunt for?",articles9,"['Malaa\xa0', 'Cookie Rojas']"
"Flume has been cheekily teasing the release of new music on his social media for the past few weeks. Just when the teasing got to be almost too much, he hit us with an official announcement. Tomorrow, he will be releasing a new mixtape, aptly named – ‘Hi This Is Flume'.The mixtape marks the first release from Flume since the companion EPs to his Grammy-Award winning Albums, . The announcement was immediately celebrated by fans and peers alike. It doesn't matter who you are in the world of dance music. When Flume announces he has some new music dropping, you stop everything and start to hyperventilate with excitement. What the mixtape will consist of is still a secret, but we have to imagine that we will be getting a decent amount of unreleased, never before heard tracks. The countdown is on…less than 24 hours to go. Check out the official announcement below.  A post shared by  (@flume) on  ",articles9,"['Tomorrow', 'Albums']"
"Weeks after dropping their massive track “Synthetic”, Duke & Jones returned with yet another steamer for y’all to splurge on “Delusions”. Having received support from Zedd, The Chainsmokers, Drezo and many, many more, the sky has become hardly the limit for the duo. 2019 is set to be a monster year for duo. Zedd was even quoted as saying the lads are one of his favorite tag teams in the game! Zedd said it! Now, they have hit us with a MONSTER remix to Louis the Child’s track “Breaking News”Taking upbeat tracks and turning them into trap has become one of my favorite sound manipulations and Duke & Jones delivered. They maintain that eclectic sound. But then, BOOM the horns chime in with a different plan of business. They deliver us into a monster drop with that token D&J sound. These guys are not going anywhere and its about time you hop on the bandwagon!

"The Woodstock 50th Anniversary concert taking place at Watkins Glen in New York State has finally announced its heavily rumored lineup. While the public has known for some time that Santana was going to be apart of the reunion, the rest of the line up remained largely a mystery. Today, the final details have been released. The lineup is a crossover of modern day top 40 with some classic rock acts thrown in for good measure. Interestingly enough, no electronic acts were tapped to grace the lineup. This is not entirely surprising considering the nature of the original event, but still many were shocked to see such a mainstream part of music in 2019 to be snubbed by the anniversary organizers. While tickets are not yet available for the event, its  is teasing a presale. Despite the tickets not yet being sold…people are already listing them on resale sites for upwards of $700. Is this lineup worth it? In our opinion, it seems that Coachella or Lollapalooza could match it any given year but we will let you decide for yourself. Check out the final lineup below.

"Getter's latest full-length Albums release,  was truly a standout last year. It was by far one of the most impressive electronic Albums to be released in the last five years. That being said, it was quite different from anything that Getter had ever released before. This caught some longtime fans by surprise. Still, most were quite receptive to the artist's new found inspiration. Getter has worked hard to broaden his horizons past the dubstep he was associated with when he first broke onto the scene. After a long break in production, he returned producing a wide range of genres including ambient, downtempo tunes to full-on rap tracks featuring his alter-ego Terror Reid on the vocals. When Getter announced his Visceral Tour, which was in direct support of his new album of the same name, it was assumed that it would be a bit different than his previous tours. The city of Houston last weekend did not appreciate the obvious fact that Getter has gone in a new direction. In a display of poor taste, the crowd booed Getter for not playing a set of all-out dubstep bangers. It would probably help if the fans who decided to spread hate that night actually took the time to listen to anything Getter has put out in the last year. Of course, Getter had an excellent response to the haters – making it known that regardless of the poor opinion of a minority, he has found a type of music that makes him authentically happy to produce. No matter what, he is going to continue to create the music that makes him happy. ",articles9,['Albums']
"RIP. It was just announced that MySpace, one of the first social media websites to hit the internet, has lost over 50 million Songs that were uploaded from 2003 – 2015 which is pretty insane news to most people who grew up using that website. Personally I changed my song at least once a week on MySpace and the website started careers for countless musicians so to think that millions of songs are now lost forever is a pretty wild thought!",articles9,[None]

"This past weekend, Odesza hosted their very first destination festival in Mexico. Sundara Festival was a massive success and featured performances by the likes of Golden Features, RL Grime B2B Alison Wonderland, and so many more. While the weekend made less headlines than Bassnectar's “Deja Voom” event, which was held a week prior, by all accounts – that was a good thing. One of the most exciting moments from Sundara was Odesza debuting a new gorgeous VIP mix of their most famous tune – ‘iPlayYouListen'. Fans might be familiar with this track as the first song to ever feature a live drumline. Odesza brought out the USC marching band during their Coachella performance in 2015 and encored with this incredible song. This rework is a bit different than what you might expect but it will for sure become a true hit in the immaculate discography of Odesza. Check out the video below.

Earlier this year, we got a preview of a  that sounds incredibly insane. If it's anything like this collab with Blanke, we won't know what to do with ourselves.The second and final track on the EP, “Download the Future” brings the same hype and feel as “Hacker”.

"Illenium is on the rise again. From selling out  and , we know there must be tons of new music around the corner. Last week, Illenium released a pack of remixes of his newest single “Crashing”. Remixes come from DROELOE, KLOUD, and Rock Mafia.To start, DROELOE takes the first of the “Crashing” remixes by stripping down the vocals and adding dreamy undertones and sounds.Rock Mafia takes the track and adds a more tropical, dance vibe. The added beat and dreamy undertones have us wanting to blast this in our cars this summer. The remix segways back and forth between melodic and dance breaks, making it the best of both worlds.On top of all of the remixes, we also get a stripped version of Crashing, which sounds like a completely different genre. But, that makes the versatility of Illenium that much more appreciated.Kloud's remix is the stand out of the pack. Kloud takes the melodic dubstep track and turns it into a deep and dark one. Of all of the remixes, this one is definitely the most different.",articles9,"['Illenium', 'Illenium', 'KLOUD', 'Illenium']"

"About 10 months ago Armin Van Buuren struck gold with a crossover track known as ‘Blah Blah Blah'. On the nose, the song seemed to be relatively simple in nature. But the catchy earworm of a vocal hook and high energy vibe soon made it the main stage favorite at festivals all summer long. In his latest release, a single called ‘Turn It Up', van Buuren channels similar energy from his 2018 mega-hit but updates it with intense psytrance elements throughout. Psytrance continues to be a fan favorite across all areas of electronic music. The explosion in popularity of acts like Vini Vici helped bring the underground genre to the forefront of the mainstream. Armin knows how to utilize the intensity of psytrance perfectly to craft unforgettable show-stopping productions. ‘Turn It Up' will undoubtedly be another mainstay at festival stages throughout the entirety of 2019. Its release lands perfectly just before Miami Music Week and Ultra Music Festival. Be prepared to hear thing little gem for the next several months where ever you go in the dance music world.

Once everything was together, Porter and his team once again released tickets for Day 2. Again, in the pre-sale, the event sold out insanely quick. We are talking minutes here folks, not hours.

"DJ Snake is best known for his high intensity, rap crossover tracks like the 2018 anthem ‘Taki Taki'. But those who have only grown familiar with the French producer in the last year or so might not be aware that DJ Snake's production range is unbelievably sizable. He demonstrates this with his new single alongside Plastic Toy called ‘Try Me'.The track is slow, and chill. Almost to the point of downtempo. It showcases harsh, otherworldly synths that will give the listener the feeling of early Flume or Andrew Bayer. While the track never gets as complex as it might have it been crafted by the two aforementioned inspirations, it undoubtedly packs a serious punch in terms of production quality. The tune carries an excellent emotional weight to it. While this nature of release is certainly unexpected by Snake at this point in his career, it is more than welcome. ‘Try Me' is a rare chilled out gem in a library of works that seem to cater to the mainstream first. Check out the brilliant little tune below. ",articles9,"['DJ Snake', 'Plastic Toy']"

Well, this week he showed us just how much more serious 2019 is looking in terms of commercial success. Illenium took to his social media yesterday to announce a two night run at Red Rocks. This in and of itself is no small feat. Red Rocks is an enormous venue, and only the biggest acts in dance music can play back to back nights at the historic venue. But a two night Red Rocks run was not enough – Illenium also announced that he would be playing Madison Square Garden as well. This is a huge decision and truly a landmark accomplishment. The Garden has been notoriously difficult for electronic artists to sell out. Skrillex and Diplo failed to do so at their New Year's Eve show, and Steve Aoki was forced to cancel his scheduled performance outright due to low ticket sales. To date in EDM, only three acts have sold out MSG in a traditional fashion – Bassnectar, Armin Van Buuren and Above & Beyond. Does Illenium have what it takes to pack out this monster NYC venue?

"While Tiesto and Dzeko's new single is no doubt  trance, its melody will instantly give longtime fans a feeling of awe in the stomachs. ‘Halfway There' featuring Lena Leon on vocals is a gorgeous melody driven big room tune. While it is obvious that Tiesto has moved away from his roots in Relaxing Music trance, this track clearly is inspired by many of his past ventures. The main hook of the tune features synths reminiscent of those used in ‘Lethal Industry' and the overall melody can fit right at home on his last trance Albums, . For a long time Tijs fan like myself, this is as good of a tune as I can ask for. It seems that in recent years Tiesto has found a way to bridge the gap between productions which please both the hardcore and casual dance music fan.

But nowhere, absolutely nowhere in your mind did you ever think you would stumble across a hardstyle Bootleg of the most aggressively marketed Christmas track of the last 100 years. Well, my friend, I heard this through the depths of /r/EDM, and now you have to as well. Someone absolute lunatic who must be brought to justice decided that Mariah Carey's ‘All I Want For Christmas' was just asking for some Hardstyle kicks. And then went ahead and did it. Here is the most haunting part of the entire sonic experience. IT KIND OF WORKS. So while this post might have worked better 4 months ago or so…it has only just recently surfaced.

"Even though Porter Robinson's festival has been embattled in controversy , the iconic producer has pushed forward with a name change and has just announced the lineup for his debut event. The festival features a wide swath of talent across multiple genres of dance music. Kero Kero Bonito, Anamanaguchi, G Jones, Nina Las Vegas, Chrome Sparks, Cashmere Cat, and Wednesday Campanella have all been announced for Second Sky. To top off this incredibly diverse lineup of show-stopping talent, Porter will play a rare Worlds live set. Since Porter launched his Virtual Self alias in 2017, his Worlds live sets have become increasingly rare.

"“Hyperion” is Gesaffelstein's first Albums since 2013. To say it was highly anticipated is an understatement. Hyperion is a change of pace for the DJ, but the album has a variety that can be appreciated. Gesaffelstein signed to Columbia Records in November 2018 and many fans are wondering if that's the reason for the change of pace.We've had a few teasers for this album with  featuring The Weeknd and “Blast Off” with Pharrell. Features are definitely something new for Gesaffelstein. None of his past Albums feature any other artists, except for the occasional remix. But, he's proved his ability to bring a new sound to what could possibly be “mainstream” music.From an eerily beautiful “So Bad” featuring HAIM to deeper sounding “Reset”, Gesaffelstein keeps us guessing.

After some well deserved time off, the producer who got his start in the world of dubstep returned to the scene under his new rap alias – Terror Reid. Quite quickly Getter was once again making headlines for dropping some seriously amazing tracks under the alias. Then last year he released his latest album,  on Deadmau5's imprint, Mau5trap. It was easily one of the most impressive Albums of the entire year.

"There's no two ways about it. If you're a fan of Bass Music, you've heard of Calcium by now. Despite remaining predominantly anonymous behind his mysterious skeleton branding, Calcium is an artist who demands the spotlight in 2019 with his hard-hitting, face-melting dubstep records.Drawing influence from the darkest undercurrents of bass music, Calcium's sound is one you'll be quick to recognise after his “Skull Vault” Albums drops today on NSD's Black Label. Amongst the tracks on the EP is “Comply” – a bouncy, squelchy example of the producer's stand-out sound design. It's no fresh news that dubstep can be one of the trickier genres in which to push boundaries, but Calcium achieves just that with “Comply”.

"If Marshmello and CHVRCHES have one thing in common – it is that they both are more than familiar with topping music festival lineups. Both the masked producer/DJ and Scottish Synthpop group have seen massive success in the mainstream music scene by their multiple festival appearances over the last three years. That being said, nobody expected the two powers to team up together, but that is exactly what happened last week with the release of ‘Here With Me'.The crossover track is about what we have come to expect from a Marshmello collaboration. While formulaic in nature, the track still checks all the boxes needed to obtain mainstream hit status. Relying on CHVRCHES vocals and general vibe for the verse, and a Marshmello style accessible EDM break down, this tune has what it takes to rule the radio. That being said, it has been marketed considerably less than Mello's other mainstream collaborations and after over 4 days it stands shy of 3 million views on YouTube. While that number is nothing to be balked at, it is less than one might expect from a high-profile collab with Mello. Regardless of public perception, this tune is a gem in the growing discography of Marshmello. Check it out below. ",articles9,[]
"It is known that Southern Florida is a hub for retirees. Unfortunately, it seems that thousands of residents in the city of Miami have so little to do; they fill their time by filing somewhat laughable lawsuits. While at this point, all are familiar with the fact that Ultra was ousted from its longstanding home at BayFront Park and moved to Virginia Key due to a public outcry and subsequent city council vote, many residents of the city are still unhappy that the event is taking place at all. A new lawsuit was threatened last week by the Brickell Homeowner Association who claim the new Ultra contract is being deemed a license instead of a lease. The group which speaks for 35,000 residents (almost 7% of the city's population) claims that the event license is a lease. While the distinction might seem to be based in semantics, there is a very real legal difference. The Miami Herald writes, By making the Ultra contract a license, it forgoes public participation in the legal process. Above all, it is expected that this new case will be thrown out if it makes its way to the courts. While Ultra does cause some internal issues in Miami due to a massive influx of visitors, the festival does more good than harm. It stimulates the Miami economy more than any other event throughout the year. So while some residents may never be happy, for the time being, they will have to trade one week of noise for millions upon millions in economic benefit. ",articles9,['The Miami Herald']

"Sullivan King combines hard rock and dubstep in his new single “Save The World”. Following the release of ““, “Save The World” keeps in line with his stand out sound.The new track starts out with a more hard rock introduction along with vocals from Sully. Then, deep dives into a beautiful dubstep drop. This song really shows all of Sullivan King's talents, which is something I love to see from any artist.“One of the first electro house tracks I heard was Knife Party‘s remix of SHM‘s “Save The World” which was definitely a massive part of my intro into early 2010‘s dance music. For years I wanted to find a way to make that song my own for live shows. The day before the first show on this year's Apex Tour with Excision, I wanted to bring something different into my sets. I finished this in about 3-4 hours and drove to Las Vegas for a show the next morning to test it out.” – Sullivan KingI personally love how Sullivan King combines the genres to make a completely different sound. In a genre where it can be hard to stand out from the crowd, Sullivan King does a perfect job.Check out our interview with Sullivan King .",articles9,"['Sullivan King', 'Sullivan King', 'Sullivan King', 'Sullivan King']"
"Weeks after dropping their massive track “Synthetic”, Duke & Jones have returned with yet another steamer for y’all to splurge on. Having received support from Zedd, The Chainsmokers, Drezo and many, many more, there latest release “Delusions” is set to take the frigid winter months by storm. “Delusions”, released on Thrive Music, hits us with a dark yet beautiful sound, following their recent success including an official remix for Zedd’s international hit “Happy Now”, along with a highly-supported 4-track Albums on Deadbeats. 2019 is set to be a monster year for duo. Zedd was even quoted as saying the lads are one of his favorite tag teams in the game! Zedd said it! Gotta be fueg. Now, let's get into their latest display untz untz with “Delusions”.“Delusions” proves the ultimate diversity that Duke & Jones can bring to production. Teaming up with FJØRA on vocals really allowed for the message of this track to be driven home, on your interpretation. The intro quickly twists to a snar infused minimal tempo playing off the vocals of FJØRA. It sounds heavenly but with a stab of the dark. The build glides us through with more minimal bass dropping us into a banana’s drop. Not banana’s like you would normally describe something as banana’s, like, not extreme, but perfect. The drop bounces around seamlessly.It's a pure display of chill-trap. Another subgenre to add to the mix! I expect credit for it! Anyway, the second drop features some short pauses that really deliver even more vibes for the already masterful track. Outstanding work, yet again, from Duke & Jones. Peep the track below and follow the lads through their journey to stardom!

That’s what I felt (at first) when I saw that Mort Garson’s cult  (get it?) 1976 classic  would be reissued physically by Sacred Bones on June 21 — and also made available on digital platforms everywhere, RIGHT NOW: a sense of loss. But then I realized that I only discovered Garson myself after the world’s best DJ — DJ YouTube Sidebar — guided me to  one day two years ago, changing my life…so I guess I didn’t discover ; the magic of the thing was only made knowable to me through the wizardry of internet algorithms.Everywhere in my Brooklyn neighborhood now, there are hand-painted signs advertising the “Floraissance,” an age of great ecological awareness that has apparently reached such a zenith that it needed a name. As I walk by the signs, I wonder, have these “Floraissance” greats heard the wonders of ? Could Garson be the soundtrack to their calls? Perhaps, in the war against industrial decay, the plants can do more than sit back and hope for human help. Maybe they will rise in harmony with the ’s first arpeggios, ready grow alongside the “bucolic, charming, stoner-friendly, decidedly unscientific tunes” composed by Garson so long ago!Stream  now via  or your favorite streaming service, and pre-order the vinyl over at .

"What a wonder to hear the skin cells of Earth sing underneath the Spring skies! You can listen to them march along, despite the fact that (and this may surprise you) Big Bend is  a Texas geographical paradise — just as Laraaji is  an intercoastal warm-winds climate anomaly, Rob Nairn’s double bass is  a rolling thunder cloud, and Clarice Jensen’s cello is  a snow-spattered mountain range. Instead, Big Bend is a sonic project of Ohio’s Nathan Phillips. Underneath his feet on this premiere track, these three other artists meet in the studio like a humming under Mendocino.“Four” is the newest tremor from Phillips’s upcoming album, , releasing May 10. It is all-balmy improvising at its most motive, with master players at work and Phillips as the seismic force pushing them all together.If you want a more direct experience of the epicenter, you can of course   for yourself.

"Now that Anthony J Hart has  to a London demographic of which he arguably considers/considered himself a part, what’s new for the DJ/producer who has varying genre interests but whose enthusiasm for old-school pirate radio remains well-documented? Basic Rhythm has certainly been Hart’s project of choice when it comes to conveying more danceable tunes, and wouldn’t you know it, we’re actually getting into the season where rhythmic flailing is socially acceptable outside of the clubs, at any time of day. Hart recognizes the springtime opportunity, so he’s just announced the release of his next Basic Rhythm album, titled . It’s out May 10 on Planet Mu, and early listening suggests that this third full-length as Basic Rhythm continues what we’ve seriously dug from previous efforts, striking a delicate balance between the dance music of old and the modern bent that we all currently love.Check out the track “Edge of Darkness” below for a heavy taste of the blend, and  if you’re feeling it. tracklisting:01.

You know, where the not-quite-gothic and not-quite-pop like to meet up to share a nice hug? , right around the corner from the good pizza place! Served up like a tasty slice of your choosing, TMT has the pleasure to premiere “Crazy Diamonds,” the lead track, the  track off of Red Channel’s  EP —  if you’re not paying attention — out next month via Upset the Rhythm.Clocking in at just over two minutes, “Crazy Diamonds” acts as a pretty effective teaser for its namesake. The song pivots a handful of times during its run, each turn of angular drums, flowing guitar, and synth riffing carried through by the dueling vocal harmonies of co-singers (and synth-ists) Melody and Casey.

"Eight years on, and New York City-dwellers are suddenly less concerned about a warming-induced future that’ll have speedboats replacing ride shares and coral replacing bagels in the city’s collective breakfast routine. The clarity of that future persists, to be sure; but helping to mitigate the feeling of inevitable human/global catastrophe is the annual End Tymes Festival, which has been happening in Brooklyn since around the time that Al Gore was still vaguely synonymous with both cyborgs and climate change activism. Bob Bellerue — a.k.a. Half Normal — started the DIY festival back in 2011, and in an  that he did with us a couple of years later, he commented on how the festival continues as a congregation of all those noise/experimental artists that he personally wants to see perform.

And one can only assume by the  that the festival maintains its status as being sponsor and contract-free — and really, it would feel sort of paradoxical to have all these underground noise artists performing against a backdrop of Pabst Blue Ribbon posters, anyway.

PERFORMANCES WITHIN A SCENOGRAPHIC INSTALLATION BY JAMES FERRARO, FRANCESCO CAVALIERE, LIEVEN MARTENS MOANA, STAR SEARCHERS (SPENCER CLARK) is a color… James [Ferraro] and I talked about The Skaters making an alternative soundtrack to the movie  before it came out, like a Skaters new album… We never quite got to it… So after , I thought that it was time to go to that place. I remembered that  was coming out in 2020, so I thought that I should make an alternative soundtrack to that movie before it came out, to sort of send a speculative magical command. Like Earth to Jimmy Cameron, can you please hook it up….I started collecting materials to go into this world. I got a few books on the beginning of the Biosphere project. The original inventor of the Biosphere project intended to basically make a space ship that would run on its own. I got a few books on the Precambrian period, an introduction to Astrobiology, and a novel called  by Carol Severance.  is really cool, a Hawaiian women who goes to a far-off planet to harvest seaweed, she loses her arms and then gets prosthetic fish/human arms. Discovers the process of harvesting the fish is a malicious government agenda, and rebels… The water on the planet is gold and the dolphins are pink. So these books brought to a super Alternative Earth/Ocean vibe, and it sounds like that. [ ] has less of a story behind it than my previous records, but it’s sort of back to the Monopoly Child Star Searchers vibe, but with a new Earth Blue shine/haze. It sounds like OCEAN INSECT ACTION MUSIC…For the premiere of , which is being mixed and produced by Roman Hiele, I wanted to make a scenography, like an opera background. But of the  worlds juxtaposition of morphed  aliens, speculative Precambrian art, and Light Puddles. I made a collage of this scene, sent it to Francesco Cavaliere, Lieven Martens Moana, and James Ferraro. I asked them to make a piece to the scenography and then come play it live in Antwerp at Club Het Bos (Club Forrest). The club offered me a week’s worth of programming. Previously I had curated something similar at The National Museum in Brussels (Bozar). There I showed movies and had performances… I had a Congolese guitar player playing over Joel Vandroogensbrooks ALIEN music, after showing . I had Ernesto Gonzalez play a choreographed  game to a woman playing New Age classical harp. It was super adventurous, exciting.So, Boing!  is a night of concerts and a LASERDISC MOVIE THEATER, playing some early 90s cyber’sci-fi flicks that have really cool folie design, SFX that always inspire me to make my own adventurous samples. There is an exhibition, called , that will showcase all the art/props made for the scenography. The 70s scenographies for operas in Salzburg and Munich were super outerspace  Dion de Laurentis. I always wish that there could be exhibitions of opera props or even movie props. I tried to do an exhibition of all the props from , but my people skills with 20th Century Fox were just not effective… … I wish there would be more stuff like that to see. Sometimes I don’t get enough from museums or gallery shows… I want speculative and parallel world artifacts, 24/7…So it all comes down to me wishing for things to exist, and then figuring out Imagineer it! Like Big Walt… , was a cool event… James, Mark, and I went to the red carpet event the day before the movie came out. We saw Sigourney, Cuba, Encino Man, even Constanza… It was really special… And then the movie, it kinda didn’t come through all the way. I want to show realities that I could image being there in the sequel, before it came out. To wish it well. Flicks have a powerful impact on me, all the sprinkles on the side… The lights and colors and sounds — I want that to be in my music… And for this one, I want to grip one for Planet Earth… Hyper-Space and oceaned out!…. It opens next week, I am super excitedMore about: , , , , , , ",articles8,"['Monopoly Child Star Searchers', 'James Ferraro', 'Lieven Martens Moana', 'LIEVEN', 'The Skaters', '…', 'Biosphere', 'Biosphere', 'Astrobiology', 'Earth Blue', 'OCEAN', 'Roman Hiele', 'Lieven Martens Moana', '…', 'Boing!

"It’s no dream: an upcoming release from Trost captures the results of a nighttime jam from Lee Ranaldo and Jim Jarmusch, two of New York’s most iconic indie figures. Rounding out the ensemble is Marc Urselli on bass and laptop, and Balázs PándiIt (who has worked with the likes of Merzbow, Venetian Snares, and Keiji Haino) on drums.Everything was recorded live in single analog takes without editing. The results, which you can pre-order now over at  (mere cruel snippets of much longer tracks, including the 20-minute “Groa”) sound promising, full of processed guitars and deranged washes of sound situated within the world of Sonic Youth’s experimental output.It’s kinda crazy that Ranaldo and Jarmusch had never met before this, but we can thank Urselli for arranging the meeting-and-greeting-and-jamming. Let’s get Björk and FKA Twigs together next, yeah? Or how about Oneohtrix and Holly Herndon? Kamasi Washington and Lil’ Pump?

"The assembly line never slows at the . Helmed by Moveltraxx founder Big Dope P, the footwork compilation series has churned out ten EPs since early 2015, each featuring exactly six cuts of tightly-woven juke. There’s an art to the uniformity; when the mold for a new release has already been cast, expectations of cohesion and thematic structure can be tossed aside for pure artistic production. To dig into the London imprint’s prolific catalog is to inundate one’s self with creative output, standing at the end of the conveyor belt with arms outstretched.DJ Manny’s “Go Down,” our first taste of , is an appropriately propulsive track, hammering down its sampled commands () with kicks that hit like feverish keystrokes. The Chicagoan producer (an apprentice of footwork pioneer DJ Rashad) treats the human voice like a form of code, urging the factory’s staff of automaton limbs to bounce at 160 BPM. And if that’s not evocative enough, just wait for those bit-crushed chords to hit at 1:24 — for a moment, you become cyborgian just by  them., which also features contributions from Heavee, Crookers, Bastiengoat, Househead Samira and High Class Filter, drops in late March.

"Charlemagne Palestine and Rrose, two enigmatic personalities in that murky cloud of music known as experimental/avant/electronic, have joined forces. Their unholy union encompasses a rework of Palestine’s extended 1976 piano composition “The Golden Mean.” The release, cheekily dubbed , will come out April 25 on Rrose’s very own Eaux label.Palestine, one of the original guard of the blast-their-ears-off school of minimalism (though, true to any real artist’s modus operandi, Palestine rejects the term), is known for his flamboyant fashion sense and has collaborated with the likes of Pan Sonic, Swans’ Michael Gira, as well as the dearly departed Tony Conrad and Miko Vainio, among many others. Palestine has taught at Cal Arts, and it was in an academic context that he would first be connected to Rrose, who was studying at Mills College when he reached out to Palestine. Rrose (a moniker most likely appropriated from Duchamp’s alter ego ) has been working in what can best be described as “demented Berlin techno” for a while now, and the collaboration was an opportunity for him to stretch his sonic palette into a more minimal place.Check out just a snippet of the collaboration below, and mark your calendars for April 25, when the full album arrives via Rrose’s  label. tracklisting:01.

"Beach House have made a career out of releasing similar-sounding albums; but subtle differences add individual appeal to each of the duo’s seven albums since 2006, and my colleague Mr. Neale  something that tends to ring true when you dig into the background of their latest:  is arguably Beach House’s most realized album following years of pretty and meticulous flower-arranging. Victoria Legrand and Alex Scally did without a true producer during the atypically lengthy recording process, and they also indulged to their heart’s content when it came to the instrumentation. Prior concerns about live replication were also reportedly fleeting this go ‘round, which seemed to have a liberating effect.Except…no, wait, REALLY, though: what  that live replication?! Some might argue that Beach House already assuaged that concern by virtue of their lengthy international tour last year, but still others (who refuse to identify themselves) insist that  are needed to ensure ’s in-person transferability. They’re a strange, mysterious, very handsome, and unusually demanding bunch. And with an unusual amount of sway. Check out the dates below.

Sebadoh have announced a new album, their first in more than six years. It’s called , but to be honest, there’s no acting necessary for those of us here at TMT’s (very much real) undersea bunker newsroom — we’re genuinely surprised!The album drops May 24 on Dangerbird Records. Its recording process took place with producer Justin Pizzoferatto in western Massachusetts, where Sebadoh began in the late ’80s. In between presumable nostalgia benders to visit all the band’s favorite formative New England haunts, Lou Barlow, Jason Loewenstein, and Bob D’Amico found time to put together a voluminous 15-song tracklist. You can view that tracklist below, where you can also see the slate of tour dates Sebadoh has announced for the album and watch the video they’ve released for first single “celebrate the void.” Don’t believe me?

"Contrary to the short-lived refrain featured on the track “De Trop” (from her wonderful album ), I am  “so tired” of hearing Vanessa Rossetto’s ongoing efforts as an irreplaceable figure in the permanently esoteric scene sometimes referred to as “musique concrète” or “electroacoustic improvisation.” The NY-based artist has been in TMT’s purview ever since her work got picked up by Graham Lambkin’s now-defunct Kye imprint in 2010; and more recently, Rossetto collaborated with fellow Kye veteran Matthew Revert on  that’s more fascinating from a narrative standpoint than at least half of the “Best Picture” nominees at this year’s Academy Awards. Spoken word continues its reign as one of the most underused and underrated aspects in music recording.

Check the Revert-made video for the opening track “the dirt” below; the track begins with Rossetto’s mother recalling her experience living  in London during the Blitz of World War II.

" The London-based DJ Sherelle likes to go fast. She’s made that much clear over the last couple of years,splattering speed-demon breaks, high-intensity grime flips, and fluttery footwork tracks across her regular slots on the local tastemaking radio station Reprezent and in club gigs across her home country. Perhaps you know her need for speed from the grinding she’s been doing in those realms, but if not, and you follow basically any DJs on Twitter, you probably know it from her February Boiler Room set. Clips of the ripping tracks she played—and a raucous crowd response that verged on a mosh pit behind the decks—went viral on the techno-loving side of Twitter the night afterward. Standing in the middle of the maelstrom was Sherelle herself, grinning, swigging from a bottle and sporting a shirt that advertised her allegiances. In big block numerals it read “160,” a  Crank-worthy BPM, to say the very least. The rapturous social media response was, at first, full of effusive praise for a hard-working and well-liked scene leader. Bitten by the electronic music bug as a kid watching Daft Punk videos on MTV, Sherelle’s been spinning in various forms since her teens, over the years making friends and fans of lovers of heavy and heady tracks worldwide. The Boiler Room set was, and remains a crowning achievement, but curiously the aftermath also spawned this strange social media furor over a moment in her set. Caught up in the energy Sherelle was conjuring, another DJ who played the event Riz La Teef reached over and rewound the track she was playing—a traditional compliment in some DJ circles that read to some viewers as a man trying to take her spotlight. Riz deleted his twitter amid the uproar, but when he returned, he and Sherelle shared a photo as final proof that there was no harm done. Still, the incident spawned thinkpieces and podcast episodes. Not willing to let loud people on the internet ruin her moment, Sherelle now jokingly refers to the whole incident as “rewindgate.” It was an ordeal of a scale that was likely unfamiliar to Sherelle, which felt a bit unfair, because the set itself—and her work in general—feels worthy of the same attention. Though her blending of speedy sounds across genre lines has forebears (she specifically cites a Machinedrum mix as an inspiration), she uses the approach in this ecstatic way that makes it feel as though the whole world around you is getting motion-blurred. It feels pretty peerless, which is why, before the Boiler Room set, we asked Sherelle to put together this week’s Noisey Mix. It’s a little spacier than you might expect if you’re a close follower of her sets, but it’s still full of unreleased jams and jittery junglist freakouts. Listen to that below alongside an interview with Sherelle about her love for fast tracks and the complicated feelings that the aftermath of the Boiler Room inspired. Noisey: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting? Sherelle: There are 3 potential settings: 1. In a warehouse rave surrounded by friends.2. In the pits of your room. It's dark and you're alone. Netflix is boring you and need something fulfilling.3. In your office—post lunch … You need something to get you through till the end.  Was there any specific concept to the mix?For me, the mix is a constant build up to my last track. I have found a lot of inspiration re-listening to Lemon D recently. Mainly the way he lays out a track and the surprises that are in store when you listen to one. I feel the mix represents that. The mix is also very reflective of how I feel [after] my Boiler Room.   Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?Bringing in the real break-heavy tracks from both Mani Festo and Sully. They are really amazing UK producers who always manage to top every release they put out.  I haven’t seen that many interviews with you out there so I wanted to get some of the early parts of your story if possible. Where did you grow up? Did you have much of a musical upbringing?I grew up in East London with my mum and sister. Both of them have instilled a strong work ethic in me from young and always pushed me to think bigger. I didn’t really have a musical upbringing but I was always fascinated with music from a young age. I would switch between Cartoon Network and MTV. So that would be watching the  Powerpuff Girls and Daft Punk's latest music video. “Digital Love” is one of my favorite videos of all time.  I would stay up really late and watch all MTV party zone playlists and pretend I was DJing, picking up mannerisms by watching a UK TV show call  Ibiza Uncovered. I first fell in love with acts like The Chemical Brothers and Basement Jaxx through the party zone. I was the only child in my school playground singing ‘Romeo’ from the top of my lungs in 2001! When I was in high school I wanted to learn to play the drums but lessons were quite expensive so I found my way into DJing through Virtual DJ. I was playing football at the time but I gave that up due to my GSCEs and whilst studying I was listening regularly to BBC Radio 1 and 1Xtra. It was then I wanted to be on the radio and be a DJ too.  My first set was in an abandoned warehouse for my best mate Flo at her 16th birthday with my new controllers. Fast forward a couple of years and I joined Reprezent, CassKidd the producer and DJ first showed me how to use the CDJs and the rest is history. Little did I know I would find myself two and half years later opening for The Prodigy with fellow Reprezent DJ and my best mate Naina.   Your Reprezent show and time with the crew there seems to have been a big step for you. How has that community and platform changed the way you think about DJing or music in general?At Reprezent we’re all like a family, we’ve all grown together, we all support each other and aren’t afraid to tell each other anything! It’s an open forum and that makes things much easier. Without Reprezent I really would have struggle to get my sound out there. I came through the ranks, did a training course and within a year I had a daytime show. They pushed me to be different so I stood out from the rest. Reprezent also put me in situations that I really learned from such as playing Footwork and Jungle in the Tate, or doing my 160 set with Novelist at Lovebox, both of which drove home the importance of reading the crowd.   In your Boiler Room performance, you were wearing a shirt that said “160” and you obviously play a lot of footwork and other fast stuff. What is it about higher tempos that resonates with you so much?The T-shirt I am wearing is actually a label run by an amazing producer called Sideswipe. His Label is 160 Philly. And it’s dope! You should buy a T-shirt. I was choosing an outfit that day and I came across it and was like… That’s the one. Sideswipe has helped me out a lot by sending me tunes and supporting the show. To him and countless others like him who send me stuff, I am eternally grateful. Anything above 140 truly makes my ears wet. When I was a teen, dubstep and grime really made an impression on me. The whole dubstep movement with Skream, Benga, Kode9, Mala, and Loefah. And for grime, it was first hearing Fire Crew on Westwood’s show spitting their track “No” over Musical Mob’s Bongo Eyes.  My iPod Classic which I still have has all of my old tunes and DJ playlists on there. But I do remember being in the car when I was younger listening to pirate radio at night. I was listening to Renegade Snares which I later re-discovered on  GTA Liberty City’s radio channel MSX 98. Then hearing that made me download loads of jungle tracks. And the same can be said for the game  Fifa Street 2. Tracks from DJ Marky and Artificial Intelligence really affected me.  I would deffo say that Machinedrum’s mix for Mixmag really changed the game though. Hearing footwork and jungle together blew my mind. That mix is now my template for anything I do and that’s how I first discovered DJ Rashad, RP Boo, and Traxman.  I’m sure you are already tired of answering questions about your Boiler Room set, given the online hubbub it caused, but can you talk about the emotional experience of that whole thing?It was really weird from an outside perspective to first see clips first going around because of how much you smashed it and then seeing the conversation, essentially, become not about you.No, not at all. I will tell you though that it’s been the best and at times the worst experience. But overall it has changed my life for the better and I am excited for what’s to come. All I wanted to do was not clang. I wanted to be surrounded by my girlfriend and friends and have a fucking good time. I didn’t realize that it would blow up the way it did. I woke up the next day with my phone blowing up. I checked my socials and I had amassed thousands of followers through the Boiler Room clip going viral. Some of my new followers were DJs and producers who I love and have respected for years. My mind was blown. To read comments like ‘this is a legendary set,” makes all the hard work I put into DJing pay off. I’ve been grafting and pushing to perfect my craft for a while! I really love the music I play and I’m so glad that people got to see that.  Receiving all this constant praise was unexpected but then so was rewindgate... It’s weird to see people talk about you but not actually to you. So it felt like an [out of] body moment. The whole thing literally created a huge debate in the music world. For Green Velvet and Plastician to be have a discussion about the whole situation is proof of how quickly it spread. It was a lot and after a while it took its toll on me.  It was about a week after Boiler Room and I was going b2b with my good friend Big Dope P for his Moveltraxx night in London. After the gig, I didn’t want to stay and I got straight in a cab and went home. I woke up the next morning and broke down on the phone to my manager at work and told him that I needed a day to process everything. I ended up having a week off to clear my head, think about the next steps, and blitz my inbox. I did fuck all and sorted out hundreds of emails that came through after the Boiler Room.  Ultimately though the experience has deffo inspired me to have fun and love what I am doing. Having a conversation with Mistajam, my manager Cal, and Scully (Mistajam’s producer and friend of mine from Reprezent) made me realize that it really has all been worth it. Going through the hard times and coming out on the other end is fucking amazing and I am not stopping for anyone.

"Drew Daniel and M.C. Schmidt—the duo behind the Baltimore experimental project Matmos—are best known as sound explorers and musicians. But they’ve always been gifted storytellers too. The records they’ve made over the last couple decades reflect a boundary-pushing approach to composition, taking and twisting sounds into abstract playful shapes, but the band has never just been about experimentation for its own sake. They’re conceptualists, layering the sounds they choose with weight and meaning. They named their last record, 2016’s  Ultimate Care II, for a washing machine that they kept in their basement, and sourced the sonic material entirely from the noises it produced. Judging from the way they presented the sounds—in interviews and in their music videos—it was a statement, among other things, about the role that domestic work plays in a long-term partnership, parsing meaning and crafting narratives from rumbling metal and swishing water. But that album is just one example of many unique conceits they’ve adopted throughout their career. They’ve made records entirely from the sound of medical equipment (A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure), and recordings of quasi-psychological experiments they performed where they attempted a sort of E.S.P. on friends and strangers (The Marriage of True Minds).The thing is, as much editing and massaging as they do to their sounds, and as committed as they are to presenting them in a way that is more or less musical, you wouldn’t necessarily gather all this from the records alone. Their pieces are sort of like scrap sculptures in that way—you might be able to pick out a piece or two of the source material here or there, but it’s easy to get caught up into the dazzling, abstract shape of the thing as a whole. So to get at the heart of it, they talk.On a January afternoon, over the phone from their Baltimore home, they talk  a lot, excitedly jumping over one another to detail the themes that informed their new album,  Plastic Anniversary, which came out March 15 on their longtime label Thrill Jockey. “This is our first interview on this record,” Daniel says at one point. “We're both still full of ideas. We both just wanna talk all the time—that's part of our couple dynamic. It's an aimless desire to fill the air.”That dynamic is central to  Plastic Anniversary, which, as its name suggests, is in part a celebration of the longevity of their relationship. They’ve been together as collaborators and a couple for over 25 years now, and Daniel wanted to acknowledge that in some way. But conscious of the fact that doing something that openly celebrated that would be, as Daniel describes it, “like sucking our own dick in public,” they widened the scope. Rather than mark their silver anniversary, the traditional gift for 25 years, they turned their attention to another material: plastic. In some ways, plastic is tied to the story of their relationship—Daniel says that he was wearing a jock strap made from a plastic fish the night he met Schmidt while go-go dancing at a club in San Francisco. But it’s also universal. Plastic intersects with daily life in so many different ways, and its proliferation is one of the defining crises of our era. The day that we spoke, another  Washington Post story came out detailing the ways climate change is already affecting people around the world. Greenhouse gas emissions are obviously the biggest part of that, but it’s hard not to see the deposits of plastic across the world as visible reminders of the harm we continue to do to our planet.These themes are potent, and across the record, Matmos approach the material from all different sorts of angles, often naming the tracks for the materials from which it wrung. On one of them, they mull over the way we use plastics to shape ourselves, eking thumps, squeaks, and warples out of a “Silicone Gel Implant.” On another, “Thermoplastic Riot Shield,” they confront the use of plastics in weapons of the state through a caustic club track that feels akin to the mutant rhythms that Arca or Rabit might wrench from similar materials. “Breaking Bread,” sourced from shattered vinyl records from the band Bread, implicates us as listeners and them as artists in this whole process—a reminder that making a record generates its own plastic waste. Over the course of an hour-long phone conversation, I asked Daniel and Schmidt about how  Plastic Anniversary came to be and the tricky process of making an album like this without being too didactic. How do you make things out this material without celebrating it? How do you depict the terrors of plastic without turning consumers into bogeymen? As ever, they were ready to talk about it.  NOISEY: Drew, you’re a writer and a professor, and you’ve been working on a book about suicide for a long time. Does working on something like that shade your work as a whole, or are you able to separate it out from the other stuff? Drew Daniel: Yeah, I mean, as an intellectual, I work on very dark subjects. I think that is part of why Matmos remains perky. I think it's also that Martin’s sensibility is more comedic, and mine is maybe a little more tragic, so when we come together, there's this odd result. I think it's, hopefully, a plus for listeners that Matmos is a band that can't make up its mind. In some ways, by focusing on a sound force, we can kind of bracket the question of “what are we feeling emotionally” or “what is this about.” Martin's called me out a few times with that. I have an emotional goal, and he'll sort of stop me and warn me, like, ""No, that's not what we do. Back off."" Emotions are bad then? Daniel: Well, no. They're not bad, but there's a lot of music that I think is emotional porn. And we don’t want to make it. M.C. Schmidt: It's just not something that I feel like we're good at. There’s a song on  A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure that's made with a rat cage. We started working with the rat cage, and it made these beautiful, sad sounds. Literally, the bars of the cage were by chance tuned in a minor key. It sounds cosmic and stupid, but it's actually real. We make these recordings of these objects, and they tell us what to do. Do you have an example of how that worked on   Plastic Anniversary ? Schmidt: Here's the giveaway for this album: this riot shield [used on “Thermoplastic Riot Shield.”] We hate the cops. We hate the way politics are going right now. This riot shield is evil. We [felt the] need to make an evil, angry song. [But when we] started bonking on that fucking riot shield, it made [these sounds],like Caribbean fruity drink [music]. Oh my god, we worked that riot shield over. Daniel: Yeah, the problem with the riot shield was that it's completely ideologically overdetermined by it being a symbol of the racist terror force that the police are at present in Trump's America. You can't possibly make a piece of audio that's adequate to the emotional and political gravity of that situation. That challenge made it impossible to finish that song. I think it was because it was really hard to ignore, and bracket the real, and just think about the object and what the decent way to work with it was, whereas other songs on the record were quite immediate. “Breaking Bread” took a form quite quickly. As soon as Martin started twanging shards of vinyl, we laid out a sound, and it just became a dancehall number, even though that has nothing to do, obviously, with the sound of the damn Bread.  With the riot shield specifically, do you mean that there's no way you could have made a track evil enough to match the real-world evil it conjures? Daniel:  Yeah, and if you're trying, you wind up producing what is probably emotional porn—a kind of didactic music. I think that’s a bad strategy. We hope to just start from ground zero of an object, and see what it affords—then, once a form starts to emerge, maybe bring in other objects. “The Crying Pill” uses that container quite a lot, but it's also got an exercise ball. It's got a DNA kit from 23andMe, like the little thing that you spit into to analyze your DNA. That's in there, but heavily distorted. It was a weird, resonant object, because people are using that kind of stuff out of curiosity about themselves, and maybe out of a little racial panic about “who am I really,” and meanwhile [contributing to] this giant database [that’s] being used for God knows what. I don't think our song conveys that, but knowing [that it’s there] adds another way into the song, maybe. Do you think about the songs as this assemblage of those objects, or more in terms of the sounds those objects generate? Schmidt: That's sort of what I was saying before: The object sounds are usually the guide for the song. Stuff like breast implants or the weird plastic pill—their meanings are so diffuse or interpretable anyway. Like breast implants—do I feel like they're bad? Is it any of my business to feel like they're bad, or good, or what? I don't know. I would just as soon let the object be the guide, and that is the case for all those other things. Is a band  supposed to be a political thing? Are we folk singers or whatever? I don't know if that's our strong suit. Daniel: I mean, with plastic as the guiding principle of the entire album, there's a kind of sonic challenge, which is how do you make plastic sound resonant? How do you get bass? How do you get variety? How does it not all sound, frankly, kind of thin? That's the sonic problem plastic presents. Then, there's the question of, “Are you doing this kind of didactic shame fest about litter and ecology, or are you celebrating commodities while thinking that you're doing some kind of didactic shame fest about ecology?” That's the irony of it. If you slow down and pay a lot of attention to a plastic bottle, are you saying, “Isn't it terrible that they're all these plastic bottles everywhere?” Obviously, it is. It's terrible for wildlife. It's terrible for our planet.On the other end, if you make people sit around and listen to plastic bottles and go, ""These plastic bottles sound cool,"" in a weird way, that’s kind of commodity fetishism. You are sort of lighting up this object and getting everybody to worship it for a little while. I think maybe the record is a weird record because of those challenges. We're trying to solve a sonic problem, but we're also caught up in the problem everybody's caught up in. It's like, “What's my responsibility for this fucked up situation in which I'm enmeshed?” I'm curious about your relationship being at the core of this record, because it feels like this one and the last one have been pretty personally focused. Daniel: I think that part of what we do is this deflationary gesture. We’re not about mystique; we’re about reality. We're about looking at the reality of the conditions in which you live and making music out of those conditions. The washing machine is right in our studio, and it's something that Martin does all day—not all day, but pretty much every other day. I think, for him, it was a way of saying, ""Oh, I'm not going to pretend that music is this magic carpet to a fantasy world.""  Schmidt: Music is a magic carpet to a banal, everyday work life. Daniel: We were pretty inspired by Chantal Akerman and people who let their art get taken over by the noise, the sound of just being in the world. Not trying to falsify it.  Schmidt: It's a way to listen to the world in real life. The world makes a bunch of magical, beautiful sounds, and if you listen to them, it makes your life richer. Daniel: Yeah, that would be the Cageian other side: To just let the world into your art. I don't think of it as much as being about Martin and me as a couple, in the sense that we're not doing sick edits of couple fights, or or picking up the sound of us having sex. That strategy works for Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin, but we don't really feel the need to do that. Getting back to the plastics part of the record, I often look at all the records and tapes that I have in my apartment and think about the amount of plastic bound up in my music collection. It's just like, “Fuck, what are we doing as a community to the environment, through our love of this stuff?” Do you share that anxiety on any level? Daniel: Oh yeah, totally. We stare at our fireplace, which is filled with vinyl that doesn't fit in our giant shelf.  Schmidt: Liberal people are so good at beating themselves up instead of doing the work of beating up bad people. It's so much easier to make fun of your friends, to torture some poor guy who runs a cassette label, instead of marching down to Tesco's and demanding of some manager that they stop carrying baby food in plastic bottles. You're already at a party with your friend who runs the cassette label, so you can just treat him like shit, out of your general sense of anxiety about what's wrong with the world.This is, of course, horrible—and why we are so slow to take on what's really bad in the world. If you start to consider the volume of the plastics that are the problem in the world, all you gotta do is use the Internet, and look up, “What is that junk in the ocean?” The largest thing that's the problem with the ocean has nothing to do with the arts.It's fishing nets. I haven’t memorized the chart, but I assure you it's not avant-garde records. I'm not saying that now everyone can stop thinking about it, by any means, but it's a different kind of action. It's a larger action. It's not torturing the guy who runs the cassette label. It's about writing fisheries councils and pressuring the government and so on.Daniel: I think structural problems require structural solutions. Voting in electoral politics is part of it. Everyday questions of how you live your life—that's part of it too. I think it is true, though, that the rise of formats like bandcamp and the proliferation of digital-only releases is also forcing artists to ask themselves searching questions about, ""Well, what's my footprint?"" We’re aware that there’s a hypocrisy to be complaining about plastic while pressing vinyl. Schmidt: Literally in a plastic medium. Daniel: Which is part of why we had this pressing done entirely out of regrind. When you make vinyl, there's edges of vinyl that are regarded as waste and sort of cut off. We're trying in our own way, with the fabrication of this record, to address an aspect of waste in the way that records are created. I think it's interesting that a lot of what's happening in experimental electronic music is talked about in terms of plastic. Like the Sophie record from last year, and Arca—people invoke the sound of plastics when talking about their music. Is that something that informed this record at all? Daniel: I think those artists have a great sense of timing and of slipping the timing, and eluding your expectations of where the next rhythm will land. Plasticity feels like a good, juicy metaphor for that—that there’s something flexible in their approach that doesn't have the stiffness of previous generations. I think that dream of plasticity as the freedom to form things is appealing. We want more freedom. We want more options. We want more responsiveness. Those are good things. A lot of the ecologically focused music I’ve heard is based around field recordings of the environment; I tend to think of it as almost journalistic work. You guys still maintain this dedication to the music being song-like in some form. Why is that important to you? Schmidt: You mean, as opposed to a 40-minute drone or whatever? Sure.  When you go into the junkyard, what makes you pick something up in the junkyard, rather than record the junkyard itself? Daniel: I think it's the joy of transformation. I love to take something and make it into something else, and there's an expressive, childlike glee that I feel in chopping audio and restructuring it. It's a way of working with an object but also taking it somewhere else, imagining some other way it could be. It's also just true that for Martin and me, music-making is a social occasion: Getting the drum line from a high school in Montana to play along to a structure that we made, or getting waste containers from a recycling plant and having those kids drum on them, or having them drum on the riot shield, or having Greg from Deerhoof play plastic tape dispensers. There's something that happens when people work together, and it goes beyond what you can do on your own. Matmos songs are compressed accounts of a lot of encounters. I don't have the calm and the stillness to just go somewhere, turn on the mic, aim it in the right way, and capture something.I do a lot of listening to field recordings. I've got hours of them on my laptop, and it's one of my favorite things to sit and listen to. But Matmos is something else.  Schmidt: I dunno. I like to have fun. Yeah, and I don't think there's anything wrong with it. My God, so much of our right-thinking society reminds me of puritanism. There will be no fun!  Daniel: I spent 12 years writing a book about melancholy, so I have deep respect for melancholy aesthetics and the philosophical problems they engender. But when I'm an artist, it's just true that I'm not particularly good at channeling that emotion directly. It's something that I leave to people who really are born to do that, but that's not what Matmos is. Schmidt: Yeah, that's a better answer. We're not  good at that. That's why we don't do that. Inner peace is not something either of us have.Matmos' new album Plastic Anniversary is out now. You can also check out a recent article Drew Daniel wrote about Robert Ashley for Noisey here.

"Photo by Daniel Felipe Mangosing /  courtesy of the artist.The freaks are taking over New York City. The underground scenes of the city’s outer boroughs have always been a hub for vagrants and weirdos. But now, more than ever, there’s this collectivist energy—a sense that the club kids, punks, and noiseniks are all hanging together and working together toward a common goal. You can feel it in all sorts of lineups across the city, but the scale of it really crystallized to me on New Year’s Eve, at a giant warehouse party in Brooklyn that featured a handful of stages filled with dozens of DJs and live acts blending boundaries between scenes and sounds—hardcore met club met baile funk met straight up harsh noise. Everyone was united around the idea of raging, and toward putting their energies to a good cause. Proceeds from the party, which stretched well past sunrise, went toward Al Otro Lado—a legal aid group that works with deportees, migrants, and refugees. No undertaking of that scale happens without hiccups, but it felt inspiring to see all these corners of the underground community coming together under one roof. One of the organizers of that party was the label, blog, and staple of the scene, Sermon 3. Founded by a musician who operates under the name The 83rd, Sermon 3 has been a crucial resource for anyone curious about weird shit in New York over the last couple years. I originally followed their Instagram page when a friend related that curiously, someone he didn’t know was blogging about shows that he was throwing in his basement. Over the past couple of years that IG page, along with the S3R blog, has become a crucial source of news and jams from the underground scene. The 83rd has put a lot of energy into building this link between various sides of the scene, in building community and supporting friends. Today, though he’s sharing some more work of his own in the form of an EP called  patricia. Drawing both on his life spent in studios and the mutant energy coursing through New York, he crafted three short tracks of insectoid electronics. In total, they just barely break the four-minute mark, but they’re packed with ideas, full of chittering synthetic sounds, pitch-warped vocals, and subtle, creeping grooves. There’s a track that, over the course of just a minute and half, mutates from this freaky ballad featuring Eartheater’s Alex Drewchin to a footwork flip with vocals by Chicago legend DJ Slugo. It’s full of this jittery, genre-bending energy that feels of a piece with the scene that The 83rd has dedicated his last few years to covering. As soon as it’s over, you’d be well advised to dig through the blog’s archive for the music of similarly minded freaks. That whole EP is streaming above or available to purchase over at the Sermon 3 Bandcamp, and The 83rd has also shared a video for “Down Now” directed by Daniel Felipe Mangosing, which features some colorful abstractions befitting the song’s lysergic energy. Below, The 83rd opens up about how he found himself a part of this scene and how it’s shaped his own work as an artist.  Noisey: Who are you and how did you get into freak shit?The 83rd: Lawd you got time to read a novel? Cause I’ma write one, called 83 lives. Jesus gimme strength.Aight so boom. I'm The 83rd, I moved around a lot. [I was] born in Texas, grew up in upstate NY and Chicago area. Chicago is ultimately what kicked off my music career. I was the youngest member of Maurice Joshua's production team. Maurice had just won the Grammy for Beyoncé's “Crazy in Love” when I joined on at 20 to start doing remixes for Missy Elliot, Mariah Carey, Ginuwine, shit like that. Me and my production partner, Brad Siefert were called The Quest and made more hip-hop based remixes working with Maurice. Eventually I felt like I had hit a ceiling in Chicago so I moved to back to New York. Bushwick raised me the next decade and a half. And so did the highs and wailing lows of the music industry. I was constantly in and out of deals that wouldn't go thru, having to beat demons and dark energy that attempted to steal money, credit and my mind and health over the next furious season of my life. As I faced poverty, racism, [the industry’s] false promises and lack of character, my creative voice and mindset changed. What I create was and currently is a depiction of what I'm immediately facing/feeling. Noises became more abstract, more convoluted, experimental, fighting, shedding and ultimately... just more unapologetic. My art became a direct reflection of my life. And so that's how I create, and choose to surround myself with people who do the same—the other freaks bold enough to simply be themselves.  You have a handful of different releases as The 83rd out there, all with differing sounds and styles. Is there a sound or a feeling that you feel like is at the core of what you want to do with this music? Music to me is a mirror and output of how your life is always in flux. As I grow and change and feel different types of ways, the way I depict, heal, and choose to document what’s going on inside and around me changes. I'm a multi-instrumentalist, so I'm always speaking thru their different languages, shredding, growing, growing, shedding. I think at the core for me, the music has to have the root of innovation, pushing the possibilities of sound across multiple genres forward.  Tell me about “patricia.” Who are they and what were the things you were thinking about as you were making this release? Patricia was made out of a feeling of being under appreciated, and even with S3R,  still overlooked. I was creating so much space for the mutants I felt pushed out of the room. Not intentionally, there's only so much square feet. So between running the editorial site, throwing the shows, engineering, mixing, and managing the artists, I was setting everyone else's expression off but still had no one attempting to set me off. I was like damn can one of y'all look to foster my creative spirit too? I’m  nice. This is what I do. I ironically felt lost in the sauce. Mother's Day weekend I woke up and had to expel everything I was feeling, and 'patricia,' ultimately named after my mother, was born.  Can you tell me a bit about the decision to keep the tracks short? What inspires that? Also I’m curious specifically about the last track. Getting Eartheater and Slugo on the same track is an inspired choice.Nothing was or ever is intentional time-wise for me with music. If my creative spirit says 'bring it back' then best believe I’ma hitchu with that chorus again. In general, I'm more interested in moving linear, exploring, as long as the sound feels fresh I'm in. If it ever feels repetitive, that’s when I stop. Oh and with the hard cut [on the last track], the track just felt over. It was an instinctual and creative thing, a case where it loses its essence if drawn out too long. I had just seen Alex [Drewchin of Eartheater] play [at the Ridgewood venue] Trans-Pecos with Machine Girl not too long before making that record, and I imagined playing Trans-Pecos and that record going, and just switching to a footwork section and how that would set the crowd off. I was inspired by the thought of it, so it inherently became my reality.  You’re very supportive of New York’s community of music weirdos. What led you down the route to that scene and what broadly is exciting to you about the community right now?New York is historically psycho right now. I'm literally getting goosebumps writing this interview about it. Mutants wanting to control their narrative and deciding to curate what they've always wanted to see is the game changer. In the last three years alone, Sermon 3, Quo Vadis Productions, Melting Point, Haus of Altr, Discakes, HECK, The Glove, H0l0 and more have all been founded and are currently online and physical spaces where we can gang up, celebrate each other and our art and plot.What led me here is a combination of circumstance and necessity. I used to  always be in my studio. Just my studio. Working, engineering, writing, producing, the whole gamut, but my mental and physical health started to suffer, and I really didn't know people into the same viscerally-creative art as myself, only exposed to the artists/engineers that worked at my studio.I would go to Action Burger across the street from the studio whenever I needed some fresh air. My homegirl Lea used to work cashier and I told me, ""you need to get out more."" I took her advice and started venturing out. Eventually I met Bob Bellerue at one of the [New York noise festival] Ende Tymes in the early days of Sermon, he was hella chill man and let me cover Ende Tymes as one of the first live events at the magazine. It was there that I fell in love with the art of Timeghost (Adam Morosky). We quickly became kindred spirits and started visiting each others studios. Eventually, just like clockwork, another label did me dirty and ghosted on me with promise of $12K. Adam invited me to start working with him at Output to pick up the extra cash. Once I started working in clubs in New York, THATS when I found out where all the other mutants were hiding. NYC clubs and DIY spaces have helped employ the hyper-creative underground community for years, and is where me and my friends squad up and continue to get cash. Lastly can you talk to me about Sermon 3 both as an online platform and a label. What prompted you to start that and what’s the focus going forward? What’s next?Sermon 3 came out of the realization that I never fully banged with the cultures of the labels I was dealing with. Up to a point yes, but then inherently some negative pop-culture limited mindset would creep in the office and I'd find myself mentally playing dodgeball with their words and negative affirmations. I knew I wanted a place where the hyper-creative was safe and supported. A place where the label brand didn't try to elevate itself over the artist. So I started the label, Sermon 3 Recordings, to output me and my homies’ genius on records, and to also reissue the genius of those before us that never got their due. It’s why we focus on so many archive recordings from the past as well.But I also peeped from my past experiences with majors, that you can sign with a label but if they don't have media relationships to premiere and support the records... ain’t nobody gon’ hear that shit. The last thing I wanted to do was start the label and go thru the same headache of trying to get more gatekeepers—this time publications—to write about and expose us. So I started my own publication, the news media outlet side of Sermon 3 Recordings, S3R, so I could not only cover the label's releases, but other releases, events, people, art, and culture built in the same trenches, that weren't getting the proper coverage. I couldn't get S3R on Instagram and the full name, Sermon 3 Recordings was too long, so I just called it Sermon 3 and now they both work interchangeably with each other.I would love for Sermon to get to the place where it occupies a bigger commercial space, (right now I run it outta my recording studio), and can employ other mutants to cover some of the stuff I'm doing by myself. Contributing writers, PR people, studio engineers, show curators, you know...people to take over staff positions, and for the company to have enough money to pay them and expand our reach and opportunities would be  goals omg. In the meantime, we've been squadding up and throwing shows with other POC and queer prioritizing platforms like Melting Point, Discakes and the like. This year has a lot of potential for some of the craziest collective and artist collaborations, it’s actually unreal. We're also doing more single deals with artists and releasing short movies/videos. Got somethin’ up my sleeve with Alex (Eartheater), along with Frank/ie Consent and PVSSYHEAVEN.

"The New York-based party Disco Tehran has only been throwing events open to the public for a little over a year, but to hear co-founder Arya Ghavamian tell it, the energy and community that it attempts to capture goes back far further. The name and the sound of the party—which often celebrates Persian pop, funk, and disco (though other regions and genres are well-represented)—is a nod to the vibrant scene that formed around these sounds in pre-revolution Iran, which Ghavamian and his co-founder Mani Nilchiani, obviously never got to experience firsthand. Their collective exists in part because of borrowed nostalgia for generations that preceded them, but its spirit precedes even that scene too. Ghavamian points to celebrations like Nowruz—a new year’s celebration that’s taken place for over three thousand years in Iran and across Western and Central Asia—as a reason he started the party. “In Iran, Nowruz celebrations were the most beautiful to me, because they made me feel connected and whole,” he says. “You can celebrate it with everyone, even people you don't know. There is energy all around, because the excitement of Spring and the moment of rebirth is here.”Feeling lonely after moving to the States, he wanted to do his part to feel some of that communitarian energy again. So he started throwing parties. First they were intimate affairs for friends, in his apartment, where he’d make stews and play music, but over the past year they’ve blossomed into these big, beautiful happenings that draw together bands and DJs from across genres and international borders. This year’s Nowruz party, which sold out a nearly 300-cap room, illustrates the idea well. DJs bounced between elastic funk and disco from around the world, as well as blistering techno tracks and acidic strains of dance music. But in between them there were also psychedelic live sets from acts like the Morroccan folk group Innov Gnawa and the brassy Balkan band Slavic Soul Party! “At these parties we realized that we are the energy we were seeking to kindle a feeling of community and home,” Ghavamian says. “This realization gave us such joy that still lasts. Nobody should feel without a home and alienated. At Disco Tehran we open doors and share our home with everyone.”This week’s Noisey Mix is a window into the inclusive community that Ghavamian and co have created. In some notes he shared with the mix, he says that while he compiled the set, he reached out to the vast network of collaborators and co-conspirators—one of which, full disclosure, works at VICE (hi Charlotte!)—to source tracks. Like their parties, it dives from airy pop songs to muscular dance tracks, and it’s basically the perfect way to celebrate the slow thaw of these early spring days. Below, Ghavamian explains how Disco Tehran came to be, and how the crew has sought to bring communities together into their shared joy.Noisey: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting?Disco Tehran: The perfect setting for this mix is in a dim lit room with colorful lights, a pot of tea, and a good friend. Was there any specific concept to the mix?Disco Tehran is about the feeling of home. It is important for both Mani and I to create a wholesome, inviting environment that creates a sense of belonging. In putting together this mix, I asked our artist collective to share tracks with me, then I compiled them together in a way that creates the experience of a journey through a day in Spring.This mixtape includes original tracks ""Der Trauma"" by Da Book (Börft Records), ""Ahvaz"" by Makan Ashgvari, ""Talagh (Remix)"" by Nick AM, ""Vita Char"" by SADAF, and track suggestions by Charlotte von Kotze (Brooklyn English), Jonny Oso, Jared Proudfoot, and Luisa Montoya. Our Nowruz mixtape was recorded at Studio Mamdos.  Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?I really enjoy the beginning of the mix. The mix begins with a poem by Jalaludin Rumi, a 13th century Iranian poet. However, the poem is recited by Ahmad Shamloo, a contemporary Iranian poet. These poets were different people who lived centuries apart, yet their concerns were similar. The Sufi master and contemporary pioneer both express their yearning for freedom and the recognition of the ephemeral nature of life. The parallel between the poets is similar to the endeavor Mani and I have with Disco Tehran, which mirrors discotheques from 1970s in Tehran. Is synesthesia a real thing? If so, what color is this mix?I believe so, and some people experience it viscerally! This mix is green with splashes of white and red. Can you give me a little bit of your backstory and how it intersects with the birth of Disco Tehran? Basically, how did you get interested in music in general, and then this music specifically.Tehran in the 1970s had a vibrant Disco scene that faded from public spaces after the 1979 revolution and entered people's private homes. Even though we didn't experience this scene directly, the collective memory of our parents embodied experience was passed onto us. With this, a great sense of nostalgia emerged for an unexperienced memory.In the summer of 2016, Mani and I started hosting dinner parties at my small apartment in NYC. I cooked Ghormeh Sabzi, a traditional Iranian stew, and we invited all our friends. Slowly the community began to grow and soon enough, the parties were packed with friends from all over the world.In Spring of 2018, we decided to integrate the parties into the public sphere to celebrate Nowruz, the Iranian new year. This time, we extended the invitation to the NYC community. The response was so overwhelmingly joyful that we decided to keep the party going.My background is in filmmaking, photography, and music, Mani's background is in technology, design, and music. I always enjoyed putting playlists together for my friends, but I never had a proper platform to share my music. Disco Tehran became an opportunity to share my music and my cooking, as well as a possibility to exchange different sounds from a number of diverse backgrounds.  What makes you want to share this music with New York and the world more broadly? Basically, in the broadest sense, why do you do what you do?For more than 3,000 years, celebrations like Nowruz have brought communities together to celebrate the new year along with the birth of Spring. In Iran, Nowruz celebrations were the most beautiful to me, because they made me feel connected and whole. You can celebrate it with everyone, even people you don't know. There is energy all around, because the excitement of Spring and the moment of rebirth is here.The first years in the USA were very lonely for me. I was away from family, living in the suburbs of the California Bay Area. In this foreign landscape, I didn't feel that I had a community to celebrate Nowruz with. Because of tough visa restrictions, I couldn't go back home and nobody could come visit me.Outside [of] a few Iranian friends, I felt that there was no room for my culture, so I never celebrated it. The feeling of detachment from my roots was very alienating. Every Nowruz, I wished for everyone around me, including the strangers on the street to celebrate it with me. Suddenly, an external and communal event became internal and solitary.It all changed when I moved to NYC. Since the summer of 2016, I started inviting friends to my tiny apartment to share food and music together. On Nowruz 2018, [when] Mani and I decided to take the party to the public, it was wonderful to see everyone, Iranian and non-Iranian alike, celebrating as a community. There are obviously all sorts of different genres and regions of music that you draw on as a DJ and that the other DJs that play with you play during your parties. Are there any specific qualities in these sorts of music that excite you most?Yes, we look for visceral experiences in music. The sound that can move us both emotionally and physically when we are sitting alone in a room. Music that is soulful in rhythm and harmony makes the cut. Whatever the cultural background, and whichever era the music came from. After his trip to Iran, Mani brought a lot of old vinyl back. We love going through these old sounds and fantasize about where these records have been played: maybe a sunny day in a room overlooking a garden in Tehran, or at a discotheque that has faded away.  While we do look back to find and re-introduce musical treasures from the past, we are equally interested in introducing new sounds. Disco Tehran has become a broader collective of DJs and thinkers since its birth, can you give me the full rundown of who’s involved? What do they bring to the table that one person couldn’t bring on their own?We are interested in seeing how our old vinyls or 70s/80s Iranian pop hits fuse with tracks from different eras and backgrounds. Since collaboration is important to us, it is interesting to see how the non-Iranian family interacts with our familiar sound.Typically, a night at Disco Tehran is a multicultural soundscape that includes music from Iran, Iraq, Africa, and Latin America. We also integrate live performances that range from international bands to local NYC musicians. On special occasions, Mani’s band Tan Haw opens for the headliners we host.The night transforms into electronic and techno sets towards the end. We enjoy playing music that the audience hasn't heard in other places, it is exciting to us to see how our music relates to the audience. We believe that music has the power to transcend boundaries and borders. What does the future hold for Disco Tehran? More parties, surely, but do you have any broader ambitions that you want to share?Yes, more parties surely. As we continue to celebrate with Disco Tehran, we would like the space to become a more immersive experience by integrating elements of performance and visual experience. We would still continue to host more intimate dinner parties together.By building this collective, we wish to create more opportunities to transmit the work of artists that we love, as well as continue to create safe spaces for people to enjoy the multicultural dreamboat. It just so happens that it is a deeply rewarding one; in that it brings people from all backgrounds together. We see parties as one manifestation of our mission. We are definitely interested in expanding into producing and releasing music soon.Disco Tehran's next party is April 11 at Public Records.Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles2,"['Arya Ghavamian', 'Nowruz', 'Nowruz', 'Nowruz', '”This', '""', 'SADAF', 'Disco Tehran', 'Basically', 'Slowly the', 'Nowruz', 'Nowruz', 'Nowruz', 'Nowruz', 'Disco Tehran', 'Tan Haw', 'Disco Tehran']"
"Halfway through the 2018 indie platforming game  Celeste, the main character, Madeline, suddenly stops all of her wall-jumping and air-dashing to say something to her friend: “I can’t breathe.” She’s beginning to suffer from a crippling panic attack while trapped aboard a gondola hundreds of feet in the air; as gnarled, pixelated tentacles encroach on her from both sides, the music swells into a spiraling web of paranoid synth stabs. It’s one of the most intense scenes in a game that is full of them, and if it weren’t for Lena Raine, it wouldn’t even exist. “When I got the music in for the ‘Anxiety’ scene, I remember Matt Thorson was like, ‘I just realized I need to completely change this, because it doesn’t live up to the experience you’ve created with the music,’” Raine tells me via Skype.  Celeste is a video game about overcoming struggles both internal and external, telling the story of a girl named Madeline who challenges herself to climb an increasingly punishing mountain while confronting her own anxiety, self-loathing, and depression. Its powerful statements on growing and persevering through life’s hurdles made it one of the most celebrated breakout games of the year, and much of the acclaim has circled around Raine’s dreamy, 8-bit-inflected score.When I hop onto our call, she’s curling up with her cat Bobbin after assembling an entire new set of IKEA furniture all by herself. “I’m a big nerd, so I mostly stay inside,” she tells me with a laugh when I ask her how she likes to spend her free time in her hometown of Seattle. (Her other current hobbies include filling out the gaps in her extensive collection of CDs by anime composer Yoko Kanno and replaying through the  Kingdom Hearts series—a personal favorite). The day we speak, she’s in the middle of preparing for her trek to San Francisco for this year’s GDC, where she’s been nominated for this year’s “Best Audio” award. A week after our conversation, she’ll be holding the award in her hand.“It was the most surprising thing to me, especially as someone who’s worked on fairly small-ish games,” she says of the massive response to  Celeste. But Raine’s real journey is only just beginning; this week marks the release of her official solo debut LP,  Oneknowing, an enveloping album that takes her soundtrack sensibility into luscious new realms, positioning her as one of the most exciting modern composers to emerge from the gaming sphere.Music and video games have been a huge part of Raine’s life ever since she was a child, but it took a little while for her interests to finally cross paths. As a kid growing up in the 90s golden age of the NES and the SNES, Raine vividly remembers playing  Chrono Trigger as a teenager for the first time, and realizing that video games had the power to tell complex stories beyond the  Ninja Gaiden-style beat-‘em-ups she had been playing up to that point. “It was definitely one of those first games that showed me what video games could do,” she tells me, citing  Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda as an enduring source of inspiration. Nevertheless, Raine was raised in a traditional musical family that put her on the classical-music-and-choir track from an early age, sending her to symphonies and recitals with the design that she would eventually go to music school. “Those symphonies were amazing, but they were things that my parents and my grandparents were ushering me into,” says Raine. “Soundtracks were kind of how I got into actual modern popular music in a lot of ways.” Her early favorites in high school included the techno-heavy remix album for the soundtrack to Square’s nightmarish urban RPG  Parasite Eve, and the soundtrack for cyberpunk anime series  Serial Experiments Lain, which she describes as her first two entry points into electronic music. “I was just extremely antisocial, in my shell, not really going out to clubs or anything,” she remembers. “But then I got these albums that were very much drawn from that scene, and I was like, ‘This is amazing. I want to find more of this!’”Although Raine continued her track through music school at Cornish College of the Arts, she found it difficult to pursue her growing ambitions as a soundtrack composer while going to classes which mainly focused on teaching her how to write grants and arrange for orchestras. Professors tried to pawn her off onto the school’s film scoring program, which Raine describes as depressingly Hollywood: “If I wanted to write something super by-the-books, I would prefer to write a symphony than do a film score that sounds like every other film score.” The indie game market was nowhere near as expansive as it is today, leaving Raine without a clear avenue to pursue her musical dreams. “I was like, ‘Where do I go as a video game composer?’” she says. “There [was] no route for this.”After school, she spent a few years working her way into the game industry, first as a contracted certification tester for Nintendo and then as a designer for  Guild Wars 2, where she made her first big musical splash with her holiday bell choir mini-game. During this time, Raine started producing scores for indie games like  hackmud,  PANIC at Multiverse High!, and  Dead State. She also began releasing her own solo music on Bandcamp under the name Kuraine, with hard-driving releases like  Singularity; it was through these solo works that she eventually caught the eye of Matt Thorson, creator of the indie multiplayer hit  Towerfall. Thorson liked her fusion of ambient music, techno, and 8-bit sounds so much that he decided to bring her on to compose the soundtrack for a new platformer he was developing: a game called  Celeste. Celeste was made with a core team of six people who all shared various responsibilities, making its development a highly collaborative process. “I think everyone on the team kind of brought their own experiences,” says Raine, who strongly related to the game’s themes as someone who’s also struggled with anxiety and depression throughout her life. While recording the soundtrack, Raine found herself pouring her own emotions into the game; looking back, she recalls one particularly intimate moment she had while recording the music for the for the Mirror Temple level. “I wanted there to be something almost unintelligible, but something spoken in the background. So I took my handheld recorder, shut myself in the dark in the closet, and just kind of talked to myself,” she says. “I improvised a little internal monologue, putting myself in the character Madeline’s perspective, and tried to vocalize what I related to in the struggles she was having.”The resulting piece is one of the most transcendent songs in the entire game, distilling all of Madeline’s feelings of failure into a mystic, funereal hymn worthy of  Super Metroid or even her beloved  Chrono Trigger. “I didn’t make that recording with the intention that people would go out and find out what I was saying, but people did anyways,” she says with a knowing laugh, well-acquainted with the obsession that a good game can inspire in its fans.When  Celeste finally dropped in early 2018, it was an immediate hit. “I was literally on a train on my way up to Vancouver to celebrate with the team when it launched,” says Raine. “I had to be on my phone to launch the soundtrack album at the same time, so I was just waiting for 9 o’clock to hit and hoping my internet didn’t drop out.” By the end of the day, the team was already getting reports from Nintendo that the game was selling like crazy. As 2018 came to a close,  Celeste received some of the most prestigious award nominations in the video game industry—an incredible feat for an indie title in a year loaded with gargantuan hits like  God of War and  Red Dead Redemption 2—and Raine finished off her year performing alongside Hans Zimmer at the 2018 Game Awards. “That was just a completely surreal experience,” she says. “I still don’t think the actual scope of that has really set in for me, and I don’t think it ever will.”In the aftermath of  Celeste’s runaway success, however, Raine found herself dealing with mounting stress, and it was starting to interfere with her work. “After  Celeste released, I was finding that while I was just doing everyday things, I was starting to get really, really stressed out and wound up,” she says. “I had a lot of pressure on myself to live up to people's expectations of me. Whenever I'm put in the spotlight, a lot of my self-antagonizing anxiety comes out.” As she struggled through this time, music emerged as a way to channel her anxieties into something meaningful. “I wasn’t initially intending any of this to be an album,” she says. “But once I started writing a number of tracks that had the same vibe to them, I started unofficially calling it my ‘Relax’ album.”Raine recorded  Oneknowing entirely in her 300-square-foot apartment, using the highest-quality samples she could find. After completing a batch of recordings she was happy with, Raine left them untouched for a while before eventually returning to them and constructing a second act to the album, as a kind of therapeutic interrogation. “It kind of became a call-and-response format for the album, where the first half was like, ‘Here’s all the things that I needed to decompress from,’ and then the second half was, ‘How am I dealing with all of these things?’”The resulting LP comprises some of Raine’s richest music yet, wavering between angelic computer pop songs like “Wake Up,” trip-hop head-nodders like “Momodani,” and softly glowing synth sketches like “A Chance to Rest.” Raine made use of Vocaloid effects throughout the record in an attempt to challenge the Hatsune Miku-style artificiality the software has come to be known for. “I essentially created this custom setting for the voice that sounded as close to me as possible,” she says. “So in that way, it’s me, but it’s not physically me.” While the music carries the same kind of animated, synthetic tones that defined Raine’s  Celeste score,  Oneknowing is a much headier listen; if her  Celeste soundtrack was like an acrobatic, ever-climbing voyage,  Oneknowing is a deep, meditative sink into Raine’s headspace, wavering in the uneasy territory between encroaching panic and hard-earned peace. While it’s incredibly difficult to establish oneself as a solo artist coming from the world of video game soundtracks (not usually a realm where one spends much time in the limelight), Raine’s completely at ease not defining herself one way or another. “I definitely hope to continue not just writing one type of music, or just doing soundtracks, or just doing solo work,” she says. “I want to experiment with doing as many different kinds of music as I can.” Raine’s come a long way since her early days of struggling to find a proper outlet for her love of video game music, but it’s that same sense of perseverance and adventure that drives her to keep pushing onward. “I always try to tell a story with my music,” she says. “I always try to go somewhere. I always want to bring listeners in and have them experience something. Some sort of transformation, or journey.”Cayce Clifford is a photographer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

"Every month, Philip Sherburne sifts through vast quantities of online mixes to find a few that are truly worth your while. This month, there’s breakneck techno from rising Copenhagen star Courtesy, woolly weirdness from Fever Ray collaborator Peder Mannerfelt, sandblasting industrial techno from Vatican Shadow, and even a dash of Japanese philosophy from the Hiroshima ambient producer Meitei.Bassiani in Tbilisi, Georgia, currently has a reputation as one of the world’s best techno clubs, so it’s a place where DJs bring their A-game. Copenhagen’s Courtesy describes her recent two-hour set as a showcase of the ways her mixing style has evolved in recent years. She tends to favor big, barnstorming tunes possessed of a single monster hook or drum groove, and the way she layers them squeezes the maximum energy out of each selection. She also takes risks with tempo: After a speedy opening hour split heavy on mid-’90s cuts—including Vapourspace’s proto-trance epic “Gravitational Arch of 10,” Underworld member Darren Price’s tumbling “Lose No Time,” and K-Hand’s hypnotic “Not Tellin You”—she drops the beat out halfway and starts all over, building slowly from an ambient crawl to a breakneck finale of heart-in-mouth techno.Whether solo, in the group Roll the Dice, or co-producing for Fever Ray, Peder Mannerfelt has had a hand in some of the darkest, most hair-raising electronic music of the past decade. But the Swedish producer’s work also reveals an understated sense of humor—just check the bonkers “Sissel & Bass,” a recent collaboration with Sissel Wincent—that comes to the fore on his  mix. At its core, it’s a cracking club set with an irresistible through line that cycles through decades’ worth of diverse club cuts (plus outliers from John Coltrane, Glenn Branca, and György Ligeti) with ease. But it’s the head-turning details that really set it apart, like a shift from rubbery techno into PJ Harvey’s “Rid of Me” and a seamless, beatmatched blend into vintage breakbeat rave. Right at the mix’s midpoint, too, Schneider TM & Kptmichigan’s unlikely Smiths cover “The Light 3000” injects a potent dose of nostalgia just when you least expect it.The Dutch producer Upsammy’s floor-filling single “Another Place” was one of last year’s techno/bass highlights; her upcoming album , also for the Nous’klaer label, trades club intensity for a more sedate style of beatmaking. Her Truancy mix is a third thing: an hourlong set of 170bpm drum’n’bass and IDM. Breakbeats have been on the upswing in left-field dance circles lately, but they rarely sound like this. Switchbacking across squirrelly drill’n’bass, bludgeoning tech step, and classics from labels like Moving Shadow, Upsammy eventually alights on more distant sounds, like a chiming tune from Struktur and a flickering, technoid roller from Russia’s Nocow. Brisk and refreshing, it arrives just in time for spring.Few DJs have the finesse of Kompakt’s Tobias Thomas; over years spent opening the label’s parties, he’s developed a sense of pacing that’s second to none. He shows those skills here, gradually and almost imperceptibly building up from a Bruckner symphony, gathering steam across gentle ambient-house tracks from Thomas Fehlmann and Farben, cresting with Soundstream’s classic Rhythm & Sound remix and closing with an acid-soaked finish by Donato Dozzy. Two emotional peaks stand out: Halfway through, he makes a recent Aleksi Perälä track feel like sunlight piercing clouds, and just a few minutes in, Talk Talk’s “The Rainbow” pays low-key tribute to Talk Talk’s Mark Hollis, who died the day before Thomas recorded the mix.The gothic dread that Dis Fig (aka Felicia Chen) summons on her new album Purge is nothing compared to the bleakness of the New Jersey-bred, Berlin-based artist’s set for the  Impact series. Drones sizzle, noise grinds, and at one point, the industrial-metal crunch of Godflesh’s “Gift From Heaven” goes off like a grenade. But what makes the mix so captivating is its ebb and flow: Amid all that heaviness, she also makes time for softer sounds, like a delicate lament from the Iranian duo 9T Antiope. Halfway through, Portishead’s halting “Mourning Air” even turns up, like a seedling pushing hopefully through cracked pavement; then classic dubstep from Pinch & Shackleton elbows its way into the frame and pulls the curtains shut again. Stick it out through the end, and you may never hear Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young the same way again.The Canadian producer Dylan Khotin-Foote has an unusually whimsical take on ambient music, full of dewdrop synths and misty-eyed optimism. Much like his 2017 album , this easygoing mix is carried aloft on drifting keyboards and laced with vocal samples—a scrap of guided meditation, an answering-machine message, a lecture on essential oils set to a wistful snippet of Debussy. Playing spongy synth pads off the occasional piano or guitar, it mostly lingers in the background, though one selection—“W’tashiwei Kiku,” a fetching slice of Japanese-language synth pop by the German group Computerjockeys—may have you scrambling for Shazam; the same goes for the naïve riff on Auto-Tuned sad trap that closes the set, with steel drums and dripping-faucet percussion in place of the customary 808s. It’s a delightful finish to a dreamlike hour.Nobody embodies the grey area between noise, industrial, and dance music better than Dominick Fernow. As Prurient, the New York musician has spent two decades exploring the nuances of ear-piercing feedback and gut-wrenching howls; as Vatican Shadow, he hammers that menace into techno, like a blacksmith forging wrought iron out of molten metal. In recent years, Fernow been better known for techno than for noise, but his mix for Ostgut Ton’s Berghain series—the mix-album arm of the famed Berlin club—travels a reverse path, plowing through an hour’s worth of dark, steely techno. It’s all pummeling drums and sub-bass shudder until he pulls the rug out from underneath. A loop of Genesis Breyer P-Orridge intoning “and this is ritual music” gives way to an extended comedown of ambient, harsh noise and terrifying whispers. A haunting, slow-motion cut from Hospital Productions’ Virile Games closes things out on an appropriately dramatic note, rising from the wreckage like a blood-red sunrise.On his recent album , the Hiroshima producer Meitei attempted to recapture what he termed “a lost Japanese mood,” flipping field recordings and traditional instruments into hazy ambient and shape-shifting beat music. On this mix for the Vinyl Factory, he unpacks that album’s influences, weaving together koto music, film dialogue, field recordings, and his own music into a graceful exploration of the concept of wabi-sabi, a philosophy that celebrates imperfection and impermanence. With warm melodic tones suffused in the crackle of dusty vinyl, it’s a meditative and immersive trip into the distant past.",articles4,"['Philip Sherburne', 'Vapourspace’s', 'Darren Price', 'Roll the Dice', 'John Coltrane', 'Glenn Branca', 'PJ Harvey', 'Soundstream’s', 'Rhythm & Sound', 'Donato Dozzy', 'Aleksi Perälä', 'Talk Talk’s', 'Dis Fig', 'Felicia Chen', 'Purge', 'Impact', 'Portishead’s', 'Nash & Young', 'Foote', 'Computerjockeys', 'Vinyl Factory']"

"“There’s a part of me that’s like, nah, come on, if you were 15 you’d think ‘fuck this.’”The Cure were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame tonight. After performing and being honored with a speech from Trent Reznor, frontman Robert Smith answered questions from the press about his feelings post-induction and the band’s plans for the coming year.Regarding the new album, which he’s been teasing for a long time, Smith gave a progress update. “If I’m optimistic it will be finished before the start of this summer,” he said. “It will get mixed through the summer and get ready to be released towards the end of the year.” He also claimed said he’s “sure” the Cure will play North America “before the end of the year.”Smith was then asked how it feels to be inducted into the Rock Hall. After saying “it’s been a really good experience,” he shared some ambivalence about the experience.The other half of my head is like, “I’m not quite sure about the whole
thing.” Because it’s a cultural thing. I just don’t know. I think it’s
like the piece that they showed that’s taking really old interviews,
it made me think about what I was saying—that I never wanted us to be
part of what’s going on. So it’s funny, I was asked on the red carpet
tonight, was I “super excited,” and it’s funny because I feel like
we’ve been  into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, so there’s
a part of me that’s like “nah, come on, if you were 15 you’d think
‘fuck this.’”Smith then came back around to offer some words of appreciation for the Rock Hall:But at the same time, there are people in it who are my heroes, so,
you know, I’m not gonna… I think it’s great. You know, there are so
many people that’ve done this, that I admire so hugely, that have
inspired me so much, that it would be really, really wrong of me to be
anything other than delighted to be part of it. How’s that? I’m going
to run for office!",articles4,"['’”The Cure', 'Robert Smith', 'Rock Hall']"
"Listen to the track belowIn hindsight, Isaac Brock was overambitious when he promised that the next Modest Mouse album would be released “as quickly as it’s legally allowed.” That was four years ago, and there’s still no word on a follow-up to 2015’s . But in the meantime, there’s “Poison the Well,” the raging A-side to the band’s forthcoming Record Store Day release, which proves they’ve managed to stay current on alternative radio. The track is so caked in the retro fuzz and amplified stomp that it plays like a test run for an upcoming tour with the Black Keys.Of course, none of Modest Mouse’s rock festival contemporaries are quite as acid-tongued. “Poison the Well” is filled with dour musings on an indifferent/callous/malevolent system: “Medicine makers they are trying to kill us/They know how to cure us, but they bet that’s bad for business,” Brock yowls, half incensed, half flabbergasted. The outrage suits him. At just two and a half minutes, “Poison the Well” is more compact and fired-up than anything on .

"Phil Selway: “Radiohead can be an awkward and difficult band to be in, but it’s also very rewarding.”Tonight, Radiohead were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame at tonight’s induction ceremony in Brooklyn. Ed O’Brien and Phil Selway were in attendance to accept the award while the rest of the band’s members were unable to make it. David Byrne gave a speech inducting the band.https://twitter.com/rockhall/status/1111790771575902208In his acceptance speech, Phil Selway said:Thank you! So, first off, I think I’d just like to set the record straight. In the film, Thom said: Phil was the only drummer. I think what he meant was: Phil was the only drummer. So thank you. This is a real honor. And it’s particularly special that David Byrne has inducted us. As David said, we borrowed a band name from him 30 years ago and luckily for us he hasn’t asked for it back yet. I’d just like to say a little bit about what being in Radiohead means to me. It can be awkward and challenging sometimes. But I guess that’s what kept us all interested for the past three decades. I’m beyond proud of what the five of us have achieved together, and I know that Radiohead wouldn’t have become what it is without the five of us.I can easily place myself back in my first rehearsal with the band at the school we all went to, and that band is still very recognizable to me, whenever we play. We’ve learned all our musical chops together. Each new song has been like a lesson and our albums act as a chart of that learning process. We may not be the greatest musicians around and we’re certainly not the most media-friendly of bands. But we have become very adept at being Radiohead. And when that connects with people, it feels amazing. I’d never take any of this for granted, so thank you, thank you, so much.Ed O’Brien added:I just want to say this is such a beautifully surreal evening for us and it’s very far from where we come from. But thank you for inviting us, inducting us into this Hall of Fame. It is a big fucking deal. I wish the others could be here because they would be feeling it. So thank you. Obviously a band like ourselves have a lot of thank-yous to make and I don’t want to spend the next 10 minutes name-checking everybody — although I’d love to — but you’d be bored. I want to thank our families, who encourage us to go on these musical adventures. Our kids, our wives, our partners. They let us go swan around the world doing our thing. I want to thank everybody who’s ever been touched by our music. For everyone who comes to the shows and participated — it’s not just us on stage, it’s everybody. We’ve had some amazing, glorious nights with you. I’d also like to thank everybody who’s worked with us. We’re a very blessed band. We’ve worked with some incredibly talented, inspiring people who not only do the best for music but the best for us as human beings, and that’s a really important part of Radiohead.But my biggest thank you is for my brothers, Thom, Colin and Johnny. All musicians know and fans know: It’s an incredible journey. It’s truly extraordinary. We’re not doing run-of-the-mill stuff. It’s amazing. We’ve been doing it for 34 years and are still doing it. I want to thank them for their integrity, their authenticity, their commitment. None of these things you should take for granted. I also want to thank them for the musicians they are. That thing when we play together; that collective sound that we make. Some of the nights we have in the rehearsal studio where they’re like transcendental moments. I thank them for that. But most of all I want to thank them for this deep, deep friendship. We could’ve done this without this love for one another but there’s such a deep, deep bond and it’s a beautiful thing. So thank you. I love you.In an interview with  following their induction, Selway and O’Brien clarified why their bandmates couldn’t attend. “They actually had other shows all booked,” Selway said. “But yes, I think they would’ve been blown away by this evening as well.”They were also asked about Thom Yorke’s reaction to being inducted. “The last time in January when we were all together he was pleased that Philip and I were able to go because he wasn’t able to go,” O’Brien said. “Not just him, but everybody felt like it was a big deal. And even if three people couldn’t be there, at least two of us could go. Like Philip says, he gets it.”Yorke had previously revealed he would not attend because he has to be in France for the premiere of a piano piece he wrote for the Paris Philharmonic. (The concert is on April 7.)The band, nominated last year too, has been indifferent about its induction. “The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame... we’ve always been very blasé about that stuff,” Yorke said recently. “So we don’t want to offend anyone. We just think that we just don’t quite understand it.”In 2017, Jonny Greenwood said, “I don’t care.”Perhaps most disappointing, however, was the absence of Colin Greenwood who, prior to induction in 2017, said,  “I’d be grateful if we got in. Look at the other people that have been inducted.” He added, “I don’t know if everyone else will go though. It might be me just doing bass versions of everything like, ‘Come on, you know this one!’ I’d have to play the bass part to ‘Creep’ five times.”Follow all of Pitchfork’s coverage of the 34th Annual Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony.",articles4,"['Radiohead', 'David Byrne', '!

"Listen to the track belowOne of the highlights of Rosalía’s rapid ascent from alt-flamenco niche figure to world-conquering pop icon was her appearance on the Colombian reggaetón superstar J Balvin’s 2018 album . With her voice dancing over Balvin’s irresistible alto croon, “Brillo,” which she co-wrote with Balvin’s longtime producer Sky, showed a new contemporary whimsy to her singing. Far from the flamenco standards of her debut or the weighty historical references of her breakthrough album , it was a bubbly look at digital flirtation.Like “Brillo,” the singers’ new collaboration “Con Altura” is meant to be playful, but this time, instead of a ballad, it’s a straight-up reggaeton banger, courtesy of a snapping dembow beat by the Canadian producer Frank Dukes and Spain’s El Guincho, Rosalía’s collaborator on . Lyrically, it’s a lighthearted mix of boastful tropes: There are nods to the singer’s flamenco roots, references to jewels and flashy cars, and even a riff on living fast and dying young (“Vivo rápido y no tengo cura/Iré joven pa’ la sepultura”). El Guincho gets a few lines in too, but his choruses are mainly there to set up Balvin, who sidles into the frame with his typical swagger; not since Gang Starr’s Guru has a rapper had such an appealingly sandpapery voice. If anything, the contrast between the two is even more pronounced here than it was on “Brillo,” where Balvin’s voice was cocooned in Auto-Tune. Her coo and his rasp make perfect complements. Over and done within less than three minutes, it’s a high-flying trifle of a song whose video and title (“Con Altura” is a reference to great heights) show both artists at the top of their game.",articles4,"['Rosalía’s', 'Balvin’s', 'El Guincho', 'Balvin’s', 'Auto-Tune']"

"The veteran director and pioneer of the French new wave has died of cancerAgnès Varda, the pioneer of the French new wave who made inventive films and art for nearly six decades, died Thursday of breast cancer,  reports.

In 1962, she released her first major film, , about a pensive singer who drifts through Paris while she awaits the results of a cancer test.

"The women saunter into frame, one foot daintily placed before the other. “We at the ,” they call out, in accents of all kinds. And then, when the beat drops, so do they, dipping and twerking and clapping ass cheeks in videos posted across Instagram.This is the general premise of #BigOleFreakChallenge, a new dance challenge in support of Megan Thee Stallion’s buzzing single of the same name. The Houston rapper, beloved by a growing fanbase dubbed the Hotties, introduced the challenge a couple of weeks ago, inspired by a gas-station twerk video posted by the DJ and influencer DJ Duffey. Megan quickly bested it with her own clip, in which she dances at a gas station in a cropped white tee and biology-defying short-shorts. Her joy is palpable and contagious, and it can be felt in so many #BigOleFreakChallenge clips. “I love seeing women do what they do,” Megan said in a recent interview. That sentiment feels like the driving force of much of her current upswing.
            Loading
          In late February, Megan released the official video for “Big Ole Freak,” a bombastic single from last June’s  mixtape. The appropriately glossy and technicolor video shows Megan at her best: surrounded by women, dressed for maximum sexiness, and shaking her butt miraculously. It’s gotta be a fortuitous combination of careful engineering and pure luck that the week of the video’s release was when things started to ramp up for her, with a lot more chatter and the beginnings of a steep incline in interest. Across the web, new fans expressed awe, old fans doubled-down on devotion, and haters offered misogyny-tinged questions about her skill. There was even the telltale sign of imminent success: rumors of a beef, quickly quashed, with Cardi B.It’s exhilarating to watch an artist’s rise in real time, especially during this era, when so many appear as if they’re airlifted from a label conference room directly to the front page of Apple Music, or are vaulted from a TikTok meme to the Billboard charts. Megan progressed from a slow build into a crescendo over the last couple of years, thanks to the grind of social media and radio station freestyles, two projects (2017’s  and 2018’s ), and a record deal with a Houston label, 1501 Certified Entertainment. Her success was local first—so much so that, as recently as last month, she told an interviewer she was surprised to learn that anyone outside of Texas had even heard of her. Late last year, she announced that she’d signed with hip-hop powerhouse 300 Entertainment as the label’s first woman rapper. This spring, she will release , a release perfectly timed to build on her momentum.Her music is both lustful and menacing, presenting a world in which women’s pleasure and ambition are paramount and inextricable, where men can either get with the program or “hit that door, go ahead, leave,” as she raps on her new single “Sex Talk.” But, as she said in a recent radio interview, “It’s not just about being sexy, it’s about being confident and me being confident in my sexuality.” One of the show’s hosts, maybe a little condescendingly, suggests this answer might be the result of media training. And while Megan’s emphasis on confidence could sound embarrassingly cliché coming from someone else, there’s something especially appealing about her brand of feminism, which takes misandry to its logical conclusion: the utter irrelevance of men outside the bedroom. “Men are objects to me,” she continued. “[Men’s] opinions, it’s not even the icing, it’s the sprinkle on the cake.” Listening to her rap feels a little like that old self-help practice: figure out what you want and then perform the action that will lead to that outcome.There’ve been plenty of other women who rap in this vein—the Miami breeze of Trina, the candor of Cardi, the controversial feminism of City Girls—but Meg attributes her inspiration directly to the city of Houston, to the sedated, slab-rattling boom of Three 6 Mafia and Pimp C. You can hear it in her selection of sparse, sturdy beats, and in the Herculean flows she delivers, effortlessly. In interviews, she often says that when she was coming of age in the 2000s, she’d listen to her favorite rap songs and think, There were, of course, some women who rapped in the unique styles of the South, including Megan’s own mom. The late Holly Thomas rapped under the name Holly-wood, and had some success in the 1980s with airplay on a local radio station, according to Megan. It’s impossible to find any of her music on the internet—she never uploaded anything online, instead distributing mixtapes via CD—but it’s easy to imagine her impact on her daughter’s work. She’s often referenced in Megan’s interviews, a warm, supportive, pragmatic momager who lurked from a safe distance. Days after her mom’s death last week, Megan tweeted that she plans to stick to her current show schedule because “Holly would not want me to stop.”Megan’s story is as compelling as her music. As a child, she spent a lot of time in recording studios with her mom. But when Megan realized she had inherited the gift and love of rapping, her mom put a wise, strict plan into place: Her daughter would only be allowed to pursue a music career after she turned 21, and she’d have to finish her degree. Endearingly, Megan obeyed. She’s now 24 and in her last year at Texas Southern University, where she’s studying health administration. She now has what she refers to as two Plan As: becoming an “icon” through rap and opening assisted-living facilities throughout Houston.That second plan is admirable, and also understandable. As a genre, rap has proven itself to be inhospitable to most artists expecting longevity, often for reasons beyond their own control. But with the increased overlap between hip-hop and pop—Cardi B, for example, has gone from rapper to bona fide household name in just a couple of years—it’s becoming easier to imagine a future in which fans could actually get to watch more than just a handful of male rappers age and grow and experiment with their art. That’s a scenario that seems deliciously within reach for Megan Thee Stallion, one twerk at a time.",articles4,"['Instagram', 'Thee Stallion', 'The Houston', 'City Girls', 'Three 6 Mafia', 'Megan’s', 'That’s']"
"Listen to the track belowThe London-based songwriter/producer Georgia (not to be confused with the New York electronic duo of the same name) creates her music from a melange of styles including grime, dub, and post-punk. She began her career as a session drummer for Micachu and Kwes, releasing her self-titled debut album—a collection of experimental pop songs à la M.I.A.—in 2015. But Georgia’s breakout single came last November with the UK sleeper hit “Started Out,” which matched the bright electro-pop of CHVRCHES with a groovy ‘80s Chicago house bassline.Georgia continues to ride the line between club music and pop with her new single “About Work the Dancefloor.” It’s charged with the nostalgia for the golden age of ‘80s electro-pop, calling to mind both the romance of John Hughes movie soundtracks and the acrid nightlife of New Order’s famed Hacienda warehouse. But if you come for the throbbing synth-pop, you should stay for Georgia’s disarmingly tender vocals, which split the difference between Robyn’s vulnerability-as-strength philosophy and the xx’s plain-spoken intimacies. “I don’t have much in terms of money now/I don’t have material gifts for you/You want me to stay a while/To be in a moment with you,” she beckons, until she launches into the perplexing hook: “I was just thinking ‘bout work the dancefloor.” At first listen, it seems grammatically incorrect (is she talking about “work the dancefloor” as a concept, the function of a DJ to get people moving in a crowd?). But as she turns the phrase over and over in her mouth, the obliqueness eventually disappears, like the slippery moment in the club when you stop  about the beats and just start letting the sounds flow through your body. Nobody knows quite knows what it means, but it’s provocative. Georgia gets the people going.",articles4,"['New Order’s', 'Robyn’s']"

The incident occurred yesterday (March 27), while Her’s were traveling to a concert in Santa Ana, California.The group’s record label Heist or Hit broke the news in a Facebook post earlier today. (It has since been deleted or made private.) “We are all heartbroken,” it reads. “Stephen and Audun were on their second tour of North America playing 19 dates of sold-out shows to a fanbase that adored them. The pair were one of the UK’s most loved up and coming bands. Their energy, vibrancy and talent came to define our label. As humans, they were warm, gentle and hilarious.

"Last year band members were cleared of similar charges following a tax investigation by the Icelandic governmentMembers of Sigur Rós have been charged with new counts of tax evasion, the Associated Press reports and Pitchfork can confirm. According to documents viewed by the AP, Jónsi Birgisson, Georg Holm, Kjartan Sveinsson, and Orri Pall Dyrason collectively evaded a total of 151 million Icelandic Krona ($1.2 million) from 2011 to 2014. The new charges arrive after Birgisson, Holm, and Dyrason were accused of previous tax evasion charges, which were cleared last year. The band ultimately claimed that their accountant’s mistake led to $8 million worth of assets being frozen by the Icelandic government.The new charges are being levied against the band by local authorities as opposed to the Icelandic government. The current indictment was issued today (March 28) by Reykjavík’s District Prosecutor. The charges reportedly stem from an investigation into the band’s finances that was launched three years ago.In a statement shared with Pitchfork, Sigur Rós said:Individual tax returns for the members of Sigur Rós in Iceland have been under investigation for 2011-2014.  Last December the Internal Revenue Directorate accepted all numbers and arguments sent in on behalf of the band for this period, and therefore no disagreement remains between them and the Icelandic tax authorities.
However, the Reykjavík district prosecutor has decided to indict the members of the band for incorrect tax returns during the same years. The members of the band regret that this matter needs to go before the courts, but at the same time they hope that their point of view will be understood. They have always had the full intention to comply with their financial and tax obligations and they thought they always did.Bjarnfredur Olafsson of LOGOS Legal Services added:The members of the band are musicians and not experts in bookkeeping or international trade—let alone delivering tax returns and related data. That is why they hired internationally recognized experts to take care of the books and all necessary reports to the Icelandic authorities. But it has come to light that wrong returns were delivered to the internal revenue and/or they were delivered too late. At the same time the members of the band thought these matters were in order and in the hand of professionals. It will now be up to the district prosecutor to prove that the individual members of the band were grossly negligent in filing their tax returns. In light of the facts of the case I cannot see how that can be done and therefore it is disappointing that the district prosecutor has decided to indict them.”According to the new charges, assets belonging to the four members of Sigur Rós (including houses and apartments appraised at $6.5 million total) will remain frozen while the tax case is pending trial. A court date has not yet been set for the case.",articles4,"['Sigur Rós', 'Georg Holm', 'Orri Pall Dyrason', 'Pitchfork', 'Sigur Rós', 'Sigur Rós', 'Sigur Rós']"

"Listen to the track belowKornél Kovács has a knack for counterbalancing slick house grooves with moodier atmospheric moments. On “Marathon”—the closest thing to a title track from his upcoming album —the co-founder of beloved dance label Studio Barnhus maintains that same ambiance amid an understated pop-house heater. A classic bassline/hi-hat combo and choppy synth riff outline a steady pocket with nary a kick drum in sight. By the time any four-on-the-floor action finally happens, the hook is already in.This relatively minimalist production would be merely serviceable without the vocals of Rebecca & Fiona, fellow Swedish dance music figures and former Robyn tourmates who sing across much of . Instead of being relegated to another sample source, Rebecca & Fiona’s hushed whispers take center stage: “The television kept on claiming I could get there without dreaming/Could I move my mind and my body like I moved you?” It’s a testament to Kovács’ club knowledge and lack of ego; he knows good drums make the people move, but enchanting voices keep them coming back.",articles4,"['Rebecca & Fiona', 'Robyn', 'Rebecca & Fiona’s']"
"Listen to the track belowPhoebe Green styles herself on social media as the “shirley temple of the north [of England]”. But in case you missed the sarcasm, the Manchester-based singer-songwriter is no one’s little darling. “I don’t want to compromise myself for you,” she announces over shuffling drums on her debut single “Dreaming Of,” a synth-filled indie-pop song that grows ever more biting. (She sighs on the chorus: “You make me feel like I’m anyone/Does it make you feel less insecure?”)On her self-released 2016 mixtape 02:00 AM, Green showed an uncanny ability to move between power-anthem choruses and moments of tenderness. “Dreaming Of” offers more of the same with a self-reflexive twist: Despite the song’s uplift, her lyrics reflect on how bittersweet it is to finally get what you want, only to discover that it’s not as perfect as you imagined it would be. For Green, though, this is empowering: As she sings the final chorus, the band swells to a new size and her radiant voice fills the enormous space around her. In a world that attempts to make young women feel small, Green finds the fuel to make herself sound huge. Or, as she put it on Twitter: “she is releasin a fuckin tune”.",articles4,"['I’m', 'Does', 'Green']"

reggaeton playero. When I was younger I loved listening to reggaeton
and it could have been natural for me to make a song like this before,
but I don’t like to force anything. As a musician I let myself be
guided by my intuition in every moment. It wasn’t until a few months
ago in a studio in Miami where I started writing in this direction: I
proposed to my cowriters that we work with a Dominican sample I found,
then Frank Dukes added his own sample, and El Guincho added
percussion, and the record was born, a Barcelonan-American-Latin pop
vibe. Once the beat was built, I wrote the hook in less than five
minutes, and when that happens it’s for a reason. I am very proud of
this song and believe in it so much, because there is inspiration in a
genre like reggaeton, but in a subjective and personal level, from a
place of power and strength. I didn’t hesitate to show the song to my
friend Jose (J Balvin) and he loved the track and sent over such a
fresh and raw verse. I think all the pieces of this puzzle came
together and are there for a purpose. I really hope that everyone who
listens to it receives it with the same love with which it was made.",articles4,"['El Guincho', 'El Guincho', 'Scroll', 'Sean Paul', 'Camila Cabello', 'Young Thug', 'Arturo Sandoval', 'El Guincho']"

"Lanita Carter remained anonymous in the charges that led to Kelly’s arrest. “I was sexually abused by him and I live after that,” she told CBS.On February 23, R. Kelly was arrested on charges of criminal sexual abuse. The 10 charges stemmed from cases involving four different women, including a woman who was identified only as L.C. The woman in question, Lanita Carter, has now gone public with her story in an interview with “CBS This Morning”’s Jericka Duncan that aired Thursday morning.Carter said she was Kelly’s hair braider for two years. “I was sexually abused by him and I live after that,” Carter said. “I try to pick up the pieces every day. It’s hard but I know I’ll get through it. I’m not ashamed of my past any more.” She said she’s been “carrying” her story since 2003.Carter says she had defended him against earlier accusations before experiencing the assault. “February 18, 2003, I get a phone call to come down and do his hair. When he came into that room and he asked me for that head massage, and I told him I didn’t do massages, I laughed it off, and I didn’t know he was for real. If I could change that day I wouldn’t have been there. He pulled my braid down by him, and he said, ‘Suck it for daddy, suck it for daddy.’ And I said, No.” She describes the alleged attack, saying he pulled her head down, sexually assaulted her, and verbally abused her after somebody knocked on the door.Carter claims she filed a police report that day and a subsequent DNA test revealed Kelly’s semen on her top. She received two settlements from Kelly, one in which Kelly denied the claims but paid $650,000 for Carter to keep quiet, another in which he agreed to stop performing a 2009 song about having sex with a woman who braids his hair, according to CBS. Carter adds that seeing Kelly’s CBS interview contributed to her decision to come forward.In previously released documents that detailed the charges, Carter alleged that Kelly exposed himself to her and attempted to force her into oral sex when she was 24. “Robert Kelly then masturbated and ejaculated onto the victim and spit in her face several times,” the bond proffer reads. “The shirt the victim was wearing was submitted to [Illinois State Police] for DNA testing and semen was identified on the shirt. The male DNA identified in the semen sample is a match to Robert Kelly’s DNA profile.”Following his arrest, Kelly sat down with Gayle King earlier this month—an interview that aired across two episodes of “CBS This Morning” and a Friday night primetime special. In the interview, he angrily denied allegations of sexual abuse.

"The man who slapped a side of pork on  and played machetes on  reflects on decades of collaboration with the uncompromising iconAlasdair Malloy, longtime percussionist for Scott Walker, has added his voice to the many honoring the late icon, who died this week at age 76. Principal percussionist with the BBC Concert Orchestra for more than 20 years, Malloy is also a regular collaborator of Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker, played the glass harmonica for Björk on her 1997 album , and has worked with a host of film composers, including Ennio Morricone and Vangelis.Malloy collaborated with Scott Walker on the singer’s three final solo albums: 1995’s , 2006’s , and 2012’s . They also worked together on 1999’s  soundtrack, as well as Pulp’s final, Walker-produced album, 2001’s . But his instrumental prowess may be best known from the time he punched a slab of meat in the studio during Walker’s sessions for , as documented in the 2006 film .In his genial Scottish burr, Malloy spoke to Pitchfork over the phone this week about Walker’s painstaking studio process, the notorious meat incident, and the career of a true musical trailblazer. “I never, ever heard any of the tracks that I worked on, in any shape or form, before I turned up to work on them,” he recalls. “It was always quite a voyage of discovery.”What was it like working with Scott Walker?Alasdair Malloy: It was really intense. Scott wanted everything to be absolutely in the moment. He wasn’t interested in using studio trickery. There were a number of times when I’d be three, four minutes into a track, and he’d suddenly stop, and he’d say, “Ally”—he used to call me Ally—“that one you, you dropped it a wee bit there.” And we’d we go right back to the beginning. What he wanted was everybody he was working with to be in the moment and to perform and deliver with the same kind of intensity that he did. And that was quite extraordinary.How was that different from others you’ve worked with?It was his integrity. And it was also the strength of his vision, which frankly, I didn’t always understand. I knew that he always had a vision. He wasn't experimenting. He would have a very clear idea, and he wouldn’t stop until we’d got it.There’s that scene in  of you punching meat. I have a lot of questions.Well, I can give you the honest answer. We’d been working in the studio, and I went into the control room to listen to something, and then I looked around and realized that everybody else had left the control room. It was just Scott and myself—which was unusual, really. He said, “Hey Ally, I have something to ask you.” I said, “Yeah, what is it Scott?” He said, “Come with me.” We went through into the kitchen, and he opened the fridge and he pulled out this kind of polystyrene box. He said, “I want you to play this.” And he opened it up and there was a side of pork in there.I said, “Well, Scott, what do you mean?” He said, “I need the sound of punching, and I’ve been experimenting and this kind of does it.” And then he demonstrated it. And I said, “Oh, right. OK.” Now, I knew that whatever sound I managed to get out of this lump of meat, I would have to be absolutely consistent, and he wouldn’t stop until I’d absolutely done that. There was one other thing he did say to me before we opened the box. He said, “You’re not vegetarian, are you?”It took ages before we worked out exactly the sound he was after. I was using punch techniques. I was using slap techniques. I was using glancing blows. And eventually we came up with the technique that produced the sound that he clearly wanted. It wasn’t just a question of punching it. He knew a particular sound that he wanted.What did you end up doing with the meat afterward, after the meat-punching?Wouldn’t it be lovely to say we had a fantastic barbecue with this lovely tenderized joint of meat? I honestly can’t remember.Did Scott ask you to use any other percussion instruments that people might not expect?Using machetes on a track [’s “Tar”]. I had to swish these razor sharp machetes together consistently on the same beat of every bar. And that was quite a dangerous thing to be doing, but once again, I knew that he had an end result as part of his vision.What do you see as his legacy?To break boundaries. That’s something which is said all too often, about all sorts of musicians, but Scott genuinely did break boundaries. In the same way as a contemporary classical music composer, he gave us information to create what he wanted from us and to interpret it. For Scott, it was actually in the creation of the recording. That was what it was for him. And he was always absolutely sincere.",articles4,"['Scott Walker', 'Björk', 'Scott Walker', 'Pulp’s', 'Walker’s', 'Walker’s', 'For Scott']"

"Listen to the track belowIf God is in the details, then consider Kevin Morby a believer. Across his four solo albums, the former member of Woods and the Babies has occasionally drawn on spiritual themes, gospel-style backing vocals, and stately folk-rock instrumentation that blossoms with horns and percussion. “Nothing Sacred/All Things Wild,” the second single from Morby’s forthcoming album , pares this mode of Morby song down to its barest essentials, leaving plenty of room for headphone listeners to luxuriate in little nuances. Here, he addresses the concept of the divine all but directly, and the absence of his customary acoustic strums opens a space that percolating congas and humming organs wisely don’t attempt to fill up completely.The accompanying video, which starts at a greenhouse, suggests an environmental undertone that Morby amplifies, with beguiling ambiguity, when he murmurs, “Bitter blue, bitter green/Bitter you, bitter me/Sorry for poisoning you with my song/I’m sorry now, but I won’t be sorry long.” Stately female harmonies and billowing saxophone hint toward the astral works of Spiritualized and Van Morrison, although Morby’s breathy, half-spoken vocals remain his biggest limitation. The song turns neatly on a simple flip of the title phrase to “all things sacred/nothing’s wild.” Viewed as a subtle commentary on climate change, or humanity’s shared failure to stop the warming process, it’s a deceptively peaceful reminder: The devil’s in the details, too.",articles4,"['Bitter', 'Spiritualized', 'Morby’s']"

"New provisions would hold platforms like YouTube responsible for copyright infringements if “best efforts” are not made to prevent themYesterday (March 26), the European Parliament voted to pass the EU Copyright Directive, which includes two controversial rules: The first, Article 11—colloquially referred to as a “link tax” by detractors—would require aggregation platforms like Google News to obtain a license in order to hyperlink or quote from a news article. Anything beyond “individual words or very short extracts” would fall under this provision. The second rule, Article 13, known as the “upload filter,” requires content-hosting websites, such as YouTube and Twitch, to take active measures (described as “best efforts”) to acquire licenses for all uploaded content, or possibly be held liable for copyright infringement.Before the final vote on the EU Copyright Directive, Parliament voted on whether to allow amendments, which could have allowed for the eventual removal of the controversial rules (Articles 11 and 13). The vote failed, 312 to 317. Thirteen Swedish members of European Parliament, however, have said they voted incorrectly, according to The Guardian. Had they voted correctly, the vote would have passed. Although the official record was changed, the initial result will not, meaning there will not be an amendment vote and that Articles 11 and 13 will seemingly pass with the rest of the EU Copyright Directive.As writer Richard Smirke noted in Billboard earlier this month, the final text of Article 13 caused division among figures in the music industry. Some praised placing the onus of policing copyright infringement on tech companies, while others expressed concerned over ambiguous language in the directive that would potentially hurt rights holders in the longer term.Here’s why Article 13 matters to music listeners: Even with licensing agreements in place, it is impossible for large sites like YouTube to obtain authorization for every single piece of music ever uploaded to their servers. This fact, coupled with their possible liability under the new rule, will lead to stricter “upload filters” when it comes to these platforms. This will have consequences for all manners of music that might be difficult to obtain a license for: DJ mixes, remixes, music that is out of print, and other music could be blocked as a result of the filters.",articles4,['European Parliament']
"A Billboard spokesperson claims the decision “had absolutely nothing to do with the race of the artist”Lil Nas X is an Atlanta artist who has risen to prominence thanks to his viral hit “Old Town Road.” In recent weeks, Lil Nas X has signed with Columbia Records, earned a Justin Bieber co-sign, and has seen his single reach Billboard’s Hot 100, Hot Country Songs, and Hot R&B/Hip Hop Songs charts.Now, “Old Town Road”—a song that features lyrics about horse-riding and cowboy hats, in addition to banjo samples and hip-hop sub bass—has been removed from the Billboard Hot Counry Songs chart, Rolling Stone reports. Billboard told :Upon further review, it was determined that “Old Town Road” by Lil Nas
X does not currently merit inclusion on Billboard‘s country charts.
When determining genres, a few factors are examined, but first and
foremost is musical composition. While “Old Town Road” incorporates
references to country and cowboy imagery, it does not embrace enough
elements of today’s country music to chart in its current version.In addition, a Billboard spokesperson told Genius, “Billboard’s decision to take the song off of the country chart had absolutely nothing to do with the race of the artist.” Reacting to the news on Twitter, Lil Nas X wrote, “😔.”As  notes, Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” is classified as “country” on platforms like SoundCloud and iTunes. Columbia noted in a recent press release that the song topped the Apple Music Country chart and described it as a “country-inspired rap track,” “a country song,” and “a country trap song.” Columbia representatives offered no comment when contacted by Pitchfork.Update (03/30 8:14 p.m. ET): Today, Time published an interview with Lil Nas X, during which the artist discussed his origins and the inspiration for “Old Town Road.” Toward the end of the interview,  reporter Andrew R. Chow asked Lil Nas X if he considers “Old Town Road” to be a country song. “The song is country trap,” the artist replied. “It’s not one, it’s not the other. It’s both. It should be on both.”When Chow asked the artist if he thinks the removal of “Old Town Road” from the Billboard country chart had “racial undertones,” Lil Nas X said: “I believe whenever you’re trying something new, it’s always going to get some kind of bad reception. For example, when rap started, or when rock and roll began. But with country trap, I in no way want to take credit for that. I believe Young Thug would be one of the biggest pioneers in that.” Read the full interview here.",articles4,"['Nas X', 'Lil Nas X', 'Rolling Stone', 'Lil Nas', 'X', 'Lil Nas X', 'Lil Nas X’s', 'SoundCloud', 'Today', 'Lil Nas X', 'Lil Nas X', 'Lil Nas X']"
"Not many music festivals would take cues from Pauline Oliveros, but at Big Ears in Knoxville, Tennessee last weekend, the late electronic-music pioneer’s presence was everywhere. Her words even made their way to the official merch: “Deep Listening is experiencing heightened awareness or expanded awareness of sound and of silence, of quiet, and of sounding…” appeared near the wrist of a T-shirt, as to constantly remind the wearer. Before her death in 2016, Oliveros regularly held Deep Listening workshops at her retreat in upstate New York, featuring a series of exercises that combined group meditation, journaling and discussion, and sound-making games. She brought those practices to the initial Big Ears in 2009, asking attendees to both create noise and appreciate it. The ethos has stuck ever since.Ten years later, perhaps the most surprising thing is that Big Ears isn’t alone in asking folks to slow down and listen. Last year Moogfest, held in Durham, North Carolina, featured a workshop on listening to silence and booked artists whose work demands sustained attention, like experimental percussionist Midori Takada and Sunn O))) drone lord Stephen O’Malley. FORM Arcosanti, which likens itself to a creative retreat in the Arizona desert, has guided meditations and sunrise ambient sets tucked among a more conventional lineup of mostly electronic music and indie rock. In Upstate New York every fall, Basilica SoundScape curates a weekend of literary readings and dark, thoughtful performances in a former foundry; in the past that has included ambient producer Haxan Cloak and meditative guitarist Grouper. Le Guess Who?, in the Netherlands, might be Big Ears’ closest analogue, sharing a number of acts and a focus on drones and improvisation alongside indie rock acts like the Breeders and Mudhoney.As people’s attention spans are challenged by the constant tug of digital distractions, a focus on meditative experiences is one way festivals can stand out. At Big Ears, much of what might distract you from pure listening is removed. Sponsor logos are rare. There isn’t even a Big Ears banner behind the stage to remind you where you are (could you be at any other festival, though?). If you want to cut a rug, you’re in the wrong place: besides a few folks at Jlin’s late-night set, sound waves are the only thing really moving. The dominant posture is something like arms crossed, head bowed in concentration, eyes closed. In many ways it is a festival experience designed for solitary enjoyment, but there are plenty of chances for collective moments as well. Most attendees I encountered while traversing Big Ears alone this past weekend seemed eager to swap notes about standout sets, either in line or on the free trolley bus between the 13 Knoxville venues that play host.The festival’s panels and workshops guide the readjustment to deep listening. Bluegrass musician Abigail Washburn led two late-morning sessions called Sound and Silence, comprised of 10 minutes of silence, 20 minutes of music, followed by 10 more minutes of silence. Jazz guitar great Bill Frisell provided the session’s music one day, while Iranian  musician Kayhan Kalhor played the other. For me, the invitation to settle in for the better part of an hour without moving, leaving, or checking my phone was both welcome and terrifying. Even in silence, the squeaking and groaning of the old floors above created a wavelike pattern. It took the full 10 minutes to focus and once that feeling of calm became the norm, the music’s interruption was abrupt. Frisell's icy, clean guitar sound cut through the room with gentle arpeggiated Americana. After getting acclimated to that, the final silence seemed impossibly quiet. At the post-event discussion, one person likened the whole experience to listening to music as a kid in their room with the door closed, holed up in a kind of isolation. But another remarked on the togetherness they felt, likening the group and the old building to one single organism creaking together.Several sets I witnessed opened with short meditations. The room was calmed with 10 minutes of gonging before multiple performances of Harold Budd’s music, preparing the crowd for his own glacially paced compositions. If that wasn’t enough, you could go much longer: At midnight on Saturday, a 12-hour concert kicked off with a bang: the long, resonant cello notes of Clarice Jensen. In theory, the all-nighter could have been a great chance for extended, focused listening; in reality, I slept through almost the entire thing. When I awoke around 9 a.m., Nief-Norf, the fest’s resident chamber collective, was filling the space with bowed marimba, cello, and synthesizer tones, creating a rich overlay of harmonics. Several musicians positioned around the room shook sleigh bells, creating a sheen of assertive noise that was still several times more pleasant than an iPhone alarm.Harold Budd and Nief-Norf with Mary Lattimore at Church Street United Methodist Church in Knoxville during Big Ears 2019. Photo by Eli Johnson.Overall, cell phones seemed to be away or quietly used to check the schedule (the app was a necessity). The audience that came to see the debut of a collaboration between outsider blues musician Lonnie Holley and the Messthetics (Fugazi's Brendan Canty and Joe Lally along with D.C. guitarist Anthony Pirog), even got complimented from the stage. “You all the audience are making me proud of your listening ability,” said Holley. The band backed up Holley perhaps more gently than you’d imagine of punk heroes: dubby grooves, textural drums, and atmospheric guitar loops underscored Holley riffing on emotional mantras about family, heaven, and the universe.On Sunday afternoon, Holley hosted a walking tour of the city, even though he’s from Birmingham and lives in Atlanta. “Walk around Knoxville and see the city through Lonnie’s eyes,” the schedule said, “We honestly have no idea what will happen here… so be prepared for improvisation and surprises.” Leading the group to the nearby train tracks, Holley, an acclaimed visual artist who didn’t record his first album until the age of 62, opened up the art-making process to the group, asking us to pick up string, bottles, pieces of metal, and anything else we might be able to tie together. As he taught, Holley riffed on phrases about the environment, accompanied by guitar and fiddle. The small bundles went into a collective box that he tied off at the top, creating one piece from the individual efforts.That element of collective discovery was something you could feel evolving over the course of the fest. Many of the musicians played more than once: Once you saw virtuoso vocalist Joan La Barbara perform her own work and that of Alvin Lucier, you could catch her with Meredith Monk’s ensemble. UK saxist Shabaka Hutchings led two of his groups (the Comet Is Coming and Sons of Kemet) and you could still find him taking notes in the crowd at Mitchell’s workshop. Moor Mother performed with her laptop and a violinist on the first night, then with her jazz combo Irreversible Entanglements and finally as part of the Art Ensemble of Chicago, each giving different resonance to her gutsy poetry. The slightly more standard rock-festival performances by Spiritualized and Nils Frahm favored huge, enveloping sounds that you could get lost in and made the rooms themselves a key part of the experience (in the case of Frahm, the city’s massive, ornate Tennessee Theatre). In four short days, Big Ears offered the chance to listen, then relisten more closely, over and over again—a simple act, but for a music festival, a revelation.",articles4,"['Deep Listening', 'Oliveros', 'Deep Listening', 'Big Ears', 'Midori Takada', 'Stephen O’Malley', 'Sponsor', 'Kayhan Kalhor', 'Harold Budd', 'iPhone', 'Mary Lattimore', 'Photo', 'Lonnie Holley', 'Pirog', 'On Sunday', 'Meredith Monk’s', 'Kemet', 'Moor Mother', 'Irreversible Entanglements', 'Spiritualized', 'Nils Frahm']"

"In his 76 years, Scott Walker lived many lives, all bound by an uncompromising vision. He was a former teen idol who obscured his appearance for most of his adult life; a purveyor of Jacques Brel standards who also wrote gravely of impending fascism in America; an avant-garde provocateur who took great measures to sing as beautifully as he could. His catalog is vast and it evolved in sweeping movements, with each album usually followed by a long silence. Here are 20 songs that illustrate the inspiring grace, grandeur, and depth of Scott Walker’s darkness.Scott Walker leaves behind an impossibly large musical footprint. Take this bit of rockabilly-pop he released as a fledgling 15-year-old actor/singer in California. Accompanied by the peerlessly named Count Dracula & the Boys, “The Livin’ End”—released under his birth name—reveals Walker’s boyish voice before it deepened into that signature baritone. It also might be the only song he sang to shake hips instead of pulling heartstrings or jarring the senses. –Jeremy D. LarsonEven the swooning pop songs from Walker’s tenure in the Walker Brothers have darkness at their edges. “My Ship Is Coming In” sounds like traditional ‘60s pop: genteel blue-eyed soul and finely aged lounge cheese, blended until smooth. But Walker’s voice opens a black hole in the center: Trembling near hysteria, it melts Bill Medley’s rich tone into Roy Orbison’s fervor. It hints at Walker’s enormous sound to come. –Jayson GreeneWalker would later distance himself from the realm of pop idols, but as “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore” proves, he made a damn good one. The Walker Brothers’ biggest hit inspired Beatlemania-level frenzy in their teenage fans, and it’s not hard to see why. The Frankie Valli version, released one year earlier, had modest success, but here it achieves new grandeur; some of the credit goes to the sweeping Wall of Sound-worthy orchestration, but Walker’s burnished baritone steals the show, utterly captivating as he confides his loneliness. –Marc Hogan“Montague Terrace (In Blue)” turns a simple musical trick into something magical. Its creeping, orchestral verses are interrupted, like a door kicked down, by an explosive refrain. Walker’s lyrics were getting grimmer and more visceral (he narrates from inside someone’s guts) but his vision as an arranger remained pure fantasy: strings, gongs, chimes. The chorus crashes in like a wave and Walker asks, “We know, don’t we? And we’ll dream, won’t we?” It’s the first time his music sounded like a secret world. –Sam SodomskyThe Belgian singer-songwriter Jacques Brel was a strong influence on Walker, who discovered Brel’s music while dating a “German bunny girl” at the Playboy club. Brel’s music brought out a rakishness in Walker’s baritone; his spectacular performance of “Jackie” remains a hallmark of his catalog, a troubadour’s ode to virtuous and licentious women, to a life well-loved and therefore well-lived. It also contains perhaps the first and best use of the compound adjective “stupid-ass” in song. –JDLFew performers combined the glorious and the grotesque like Walker. “The Amorous Humphrey Plugg” tells the story of a mild-mannered husband quietly, absently enduring his own life (screaming kids, noisy neighbors, the ill-fitting suit of his responsibilities) only to slip out and spend the night with prostitutes. The lyrics scan as confessional, even apologetic, but Walker sings it with unbridled pride. It’s the sound of a man who has transfigured his shame by embracing it; here among the waste, the lust, and the transactional garishness of it all, he finally comes alive. –Mike Powell“See the dwarfs and see the giants/Which one would you choose to be?” This seems like a good old Faustian question, the kind a lot of forbidding, capital-A Artists—Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Webern—posed to themselves in the 20th century. Walker asked it in song at the end of the 1960s, just before he disappeared into self-imposed obscurity. He was sending a message, maybe, about what might be driving his increasingly inscrutable muse. He would soon enter into a long transformation, one that would last the rest of his career: This song, less than two minutes long, is like a telegram sent out to the world just before the cliff plunge. –JGOn the fourth of his solo albums, Scott Walker took control of nearly every aspect of his work and tiptoed his way into the void—a world populated by only the most severe Ingmar Bergman movies, full of lyrical references to plagues and fires and witch trials. The pitilessness that would become central to his later music was still soft-pedaled here, surrounded by gentle and conventionally gorgeous sounds. “The Seventh Seal” might have been built entirely around the “playing chess with death” scene from the titular Bergman film, but it was leavened with orchestral arrangements that could have worked in a Morricone score.  Right down to the mariachi trumpet, “Seventh Seal” feels ripe enough to split open; the intoxicating sweetness of rot had entered Walker’s work. –JGWomen often darkened the doors of Walker’s songs, but he was never finer than when he sang of true love and affection. On , after sprawling epics about the Vietnam War and the ghost of Joseph Stalin, Walker becomes quiet and light-headed for every thrilling second of “Duchess.” Listen to the way his burgundy baritone quivers at the end of “Put all your love back in me”—it feels like a rare moment of weakness for Walker, a tremble that strengthens one of his most direct and elegantly drawn songs. –JDL was a bitterly funny title for the Walker Brothers’ 1975 reunion album and comeback single—the return statement from a group led by a man who clearly didn’t want to be there. And look, there he is on the album cover: shirtless, beer in hand, hiding his face as if to say, “Please don’t let anybody see me like this.”Around this time, Walker was in his wandering phase. He was releasing albums of covers that did little for his legacy, and the strange music brewing in his head hadn’t yet become realized. But against all odds, “No Regrets” is no cash-in. The former boy band’s take on Tom Rush’s folk song makes lush, understated use of Walker’s voice, communicating a new kind of sadness. “I don’t want you back,” he sings, almost distractedly. “We’d only cry again.” It’s like he could see a black hole forming in the distance, somewhere he could escape into and never return. –SSWhen the Walker Brothers reconvened for their final album, , each member took a stab at writing songs—but there’s no question who made the most of the opportunity. The album’s highlight, “The Electrician,” stands at an exhilarating divide between Walker’s pop past and his avant-garde future, with eerie dissonance and tortured lyrics—it’s a few short breaths from “kill me” to “thrill me”—interrupted by a radiant instrumental section. Though decidedly in sync with late-’70s Bowie and Eno, and an arguable inspiration for early-’80s synth pop, “The Electrician” still sounds like no one but Walker—though Laurie Anderson’s even more abstracted 2009 cover version is also highly recommended. –MHStories about Walker’s career are usually separated into a neat timeline, distinguishing his sweeping early work from his stark later experiments. But what about his sole release of the 1980s, , a record that was melodically bold and sonically sleek yet undoubtedly weirder than anything that came before? “This is how you disappear,” he howls in its opening song, “Rawhide,” and his words are not to be taken lightly. The album itself seems to be in the process of vanishing; half the tracks are untitled, as if disintegrating in real time, stripping away any extraneous signposts. Walker is often remembered for his statements of purpose, but it’s important to remember how stunning he looked in motion. –SSWalker’s twelfth album, , propelled him beyond the clutches of anything resembling a casual listenership: Each of his songs would now bristle with foreboding and melancholy, with Walker the victim, witness, and narrator of terrible historic events. On “Farmer in the City,” he laments the life and death of filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini—though, as ever, his inscrutable lyrics conjure not only one man’s life but seem to symbolize the thwarted hopes and fantasies of all civilization.The vessel for these omens is Walker’s dire wail, a sound like a loved one choking up mid-sentence. On “Farmer in the City,” his voice seems to inhabit that vulnerable moment and draw it out into a monstrous spectacle. But while each note sounds like a personal tragedy to be conquered, the song’s finale speaks to the wonder of a tragic life worth living. –Jazz MonroeBy , Walker had given up on pop for something that sounded more like opera, or the nightmare ballads of Broadway villains. Not that such distinctions really mattered anymore: Anyone who finds solace or meaning in the disjointed convulsions of “Patriot”—in a solitary flute trilling in a gray wasteland, in Walker wailing the name of a Swiss-German newspaper as though it’s a secret being extracted from him by torture—probably doesn’t care about genre divisions. As for the subtitle, “A Single”—well, he could be funny, too. –MPIt’s easy to get lost in the footnotes of Walker’s music—the references, the allusions, the extra-textual stuff that can enrich the experience but also put you at a distance from it. It’s a paradox—am I listening, or am I researching?—that makes listening to Walker’s post- music as vexing as it is fascinating. Does one have to know, for example, that the 13-minute “Clara” was supposedly inspired by the public executions of Benito Mussolini and his mistress, Clara Petacci? Probably not; the violence is plain enough without annotation. That said, if you were wondering what the percussive pitter-patter sounds are around the two-minute mark, they’re punches to a side of meat.In the song’s waning seconds, we hear the sound of Walker talking, telling the story of a swallow flying desperately around his room, flinging itself on his bed in exhaustion. “I picked it up/So as not to frighten it,” he says, his voice trembling. “I opened the window/Then I opened my hand.” Then the music stops short, on a rare moment of hope. –MPAlthough Walker’s sonic palette was vast, he didn’t need many hues to make obvious a work was his. With a romantic title and a bare-bones arrangement—just solo acoustic guitar and voice—“A Lover Loves” arrives as a superficial respite at the end of Walker’s dense, notoriously difficult album . But Walker’s musings on eyeball parts and dance styles, punctuated with hissing interjections, make for an experience every bit as singular as his excursions into noise rock and modern classical. Perhaps the love being portrayed here isn’t between intimate partners but between an artist and art itself. –MHWalker and Natasha Khan, aka Bat for Lashes, never met during their collaboration on “The Big Sleep,” from her album . But artistically, they were clearly inhabiting the same space, trading emotional vocals over spectral piano plinks to cap Khan’s aptly ambitious conceptual work. (It involved philosophical fables and an alter ego named Pearl.) When  hit No. 5 on the UK album charts,  Walker told Khan, “I must be losing my edge.” –MHIf Walker sometimes grounded his experimental impulses in base appeals, he rarely did so more overtly than on the  standout “Corps de Blah.” That is to say: This 10-minute exhibition of unpredictable sounds and portentous crooning also includes a fart joke. “A sphincter’s tooting our tune,” Walker moans right after notably flatulent trumpeting. If the room clears, that’s all the more space for curious listeners to stay and grin at the richly detailed absurdity. –MHOn “Epizootics!,” from , Walker spins visionary terror from religious fanfares, steel guitar, and thundering percussion—and sets it in the less-than-hellish landscape of Hawaii. Decaying flowers mirror stomach-turning evocations of rotted flesh, the corpse of a corrupted society where death is close and the devil is real. Our only human company is Walker’s voice, resonant and evocative, compressing the real and the impossible. –Anna GacaIt sounded like a bad Twitter joke: Scott O))). But the maximum darkness of late-era Walker and the maximum volume of Sunn O))) yielded incredible results on their collaborative album, . Their gnarly, pitch-black excursion ends with “Lullaby,” a song Walker originally wrote in 1999 for the German singer and actress Ute Lemper. The rework is a kind of Kurt Weill-meets-doom-metal piece about the moral quandaries of assisted suicide. “The most intimate personal choices and requests central to your personal dignity will be sung,” Walker closes, a fitting eulogy. –JDL",articles4,"['Scott Walker', 'Jacques Brel', 'Scott Walker', 'Walker’s', 'Walker’s', 'Walker Brothers', 'Roy Orbison’s', 'Walker’s', 'The Walker Brothers’', 'Walker’s', 'Terrace', 'Walker’s', 'Jacques Brel', 'Brel’s', 'Walker’s', 'Walker', 'Scott Walker', 'Right', 'Walker’s', 'Walker’s', 'Tom Rush’s', 'Walker’s', 'Walker Brothers', 'Walker’s', 'Laurie Anderson’s', 'Walker’s', 'Walker’s', '–MPIt', 'Walker’s', 'Walker’s', 'Benito Mussolini', '–MPAlthough Walker’s', 'Walker’s', 'Natasha Khan', 'Bat for Lashes', 'Khan’s', 'Pearl', 'Khan', 'Walker’s', '“Lullaby', 'Ute Lemper']"
"Frontman of iconic ska punk band died following health complicationsRanking Roger, longtime frontman of British ska punk band the Beat (billed as the English Beat in North America), has died. Roger passed away at home surrounded by family members, according to the Beat’s Facebook post. “Roger’s family would like to thank everyone for their constant support during this tough time. More to follow in the coming days,” the statement reads. In a video from January, Roger opened up his health complications, including brain tumors and lung cancer. It’s unclear what the cause of death is at this time.Ranking Roger was born Roger Charlery in 1963. After a brief stint playing drums in the Dum Dum Boys, he became a founding member of the Beat, joining the group as a teenager.

Alexakis says he was diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) three years ago following a car accident, though doctors said he’s had it for “anywhere between 10 to 20 years.” Read the full letter here.“One of the reasons I wanted to be more public about my disease is that I have been hearing a lot of people say that I am drinking again or back on drugs because they have seen me look unsteady on stage or around town,” Alexakis continued. He’s been sober for almost 30 years. “So, if you see me stumbling… sweaty, looking both tired and anxious at the same time, maybe a little more confused than usual, or forgetting lyrics yet looking happy (which is weird for me), please know that I have not fallen off the wagon.

"Making  into a movie was never going to be easy. Music journalist and icky-guy whisperer Neil Strauss’ 2001 book turned hours of interviews, as well as photos, found texts, and a scanned telegram from Lita Ford, into a mostly definitive autobiography of Mötley Crüe, the hard-living quartet that ruled the Sunset Strip for the bulk of the 1980s.The book’s lengthy road to Netflix's ever-expanding content repository (it debuted there Friday) began in 2006, when MTV Films and its corporate sibling Paramount Pictures bought the rights. Studios and directors played hot potato with the property until 2017, when the streaming-video giant plucked it, and director Jeff Tremaine, out of turnaround. Tremaine, along with screenwriters Tom Kapinos and Amanda Adelson, had a lot to work with; then again, carving 431 pages of detailed yet drug-and-orgasm-addled memories from multiple narrators into a studio-length biopic is a daunting task.Strauss’ tome veers from high highs to low lows as vocalist Vince Neil, guitarist Mick Mars, bassist Nikki Sixx, and drummer Tommy Lee—as well as various friends and foes—recount the band’s come-up and subsequent redemption cycles (there were quite a few) in almost pornographic detail, which Strauss relays with enthusiasm. Try to take in this passage, in which Neil recalls the culinary offerings of their flophouse near the Sunset Strip rock mecca Whisky A Go-Go, without feeling at least  sensory reaction:The kitchen was smaller than a bathroom, and just as putrid. In the
fridge there’d usually be some old tuna fish, beer, Oscar Mayer
bologna, expired mayonnaise, and maybe hot dogs if it was the
beginning of the week and we’d either stolen them from the liquor
store downstairs or bought them with spare money. Usually, though, Big
Bill, a 450-pound biker and bouncer from the Troubadour (who died a
year later from a cocaine overdose), would come over and eat all the
hot dogs. We’d be too scared to tell him it was all we had.That’s the sixth paragraph of the book.So it seems inevitable that , condensed to 108 minutes, would be something of a disappointment. The details Strauss wrung out of his subjects are, for varying reasons, too much for a band-approved, mass-produced movie, whether it’s the seedier sexual encounters that would immediately provoke #MeToo-era cancellation, the intricacies of band politics and solo-project adventures, the identities of women in the guys’ lives, or the fact that Netflix has yet to add aromatics to its on-demand options.The abridging has a cookie-cutter effect on the band members, whose distinct voices criss-crossing made the book feel like a winding, sometimes contradictory, post-show bullshit session. The narrations are clearly the writers’ way around this problem, but they often land clunkily, and only reinforce the broad-stroke portrayals on screen. Take Mars, who is played by Iwan Rheon as a brooding, ghostlike figure, his ankylosing spondylitis arthritis hovering over him like a death sentence. But in the book, he reveals himself to be a bit more of a weirdo (even in this conspiracy-theory-heavy age, you don’t encounter Titanic truthers too often), balancing out Sixx’s thorniness, Lee’s endless exuberance, and Neil’s petulance in a way that made the band’s appeal more prickly than MTV brethren like Twisted Sister or Quiet Riot.When Mötley’s catalog was good, it was at the pinnacle of hard rock, slicing arena-rock bluster down to its essentials and adding just enough gutter-sourced grime to make every riff pack a punch. , the band's first album, shimmies at the vortex of glam, punk, power pop, and metal; , their 1989 post-getting-clean comeback, pairs parade-balloon-sized versions of Mars’ riffs and Lee’s drumming with hooky anthems. , however, lacks the sharp focus of those two Crüe pinnacles. It can’t seem to decide between being a smirking send-up of rock-star and rock-movie excess, or a love letter to the band’s collective youth. The impeccable recreations of Crüe live shows and MTV-beloved videos would suggest the latter route. As for the former, the moments that break the fourth wall are too few and far between, although they’re often satisfying: There’s a glorious sequence where Colson “Machine Gun Kelly” Baker takes the viewer on a first-person-perspective travelogue of a typical day in Tommy Lee’s life—complete with 5 p.m. wake-up call, unasked-for blow job, hotel room destruction, and wiry, speed-spiked adrenaline—that both revels in the vacuity of the band’s decadence and makes it feel kind of terrifying, until it forcibly stops.With the exception of scenes like this, the movie follows a familiar arc: Band of seeming misfits gets together; band succeeds against some (but not all) odds; band loses itself up its own collective asshole; tragedy strikes; rehab trip; rinse; shuffle those last three and repeat. It opens in the early 1970s, when Sixx—then using his birth name, Frank Feranna—leaves Seattle for Los Angeles; it ends in the ’90s, after Neil’s return to the fold but before Lee’s departure for rap-rock pastures. In between, there’s tons of sex, thousands of dollars’ worth of drugs, and too much infighting, all of which function as workplace perks and/or annoyances would in a more mundane on-the-job flick. Sex is viewed like sustenance that can also give the guys and their associates bragging rights; the women in the movie mostly exist as eye candy, to the point where Neil’s first two wives are collapsed into a single character. Lee’s later-in-life domestic violence toward Pamela Anderson, meanwhile, isn’t in the movie (its timeline doesn’t span that late), but it is foreshadowed by an incident where he punches a girlfriend who repeatedly called his mother a cunt.Ultimately,  resembles one of those re-recorded greatest-hits albums that the Crüe’s hard-rock compatriots released during their lean years: trying to recreate past glories, only to sound like a tribute band’s game. The first set piece in the Mötley House, featuring a woman whose Lee-coaxed orgasm very nearly soaks her fellow partygoers, feels like Tremaine nodding to his past as a co-creator of MTV's gross-out fest “Jackass.” (While the  might have been exaggerated, the woman in question was very real, and dubbed “Bullwinkle” while dating Lee.) The car accident that killed Razzle, drummer for Finnish glamsters Hanoi Rocks, brings to mind the crash in , and downplays the searing effect it had on the hard rock world. And the band rehearsing in a studio that's festooned with a larger-than-life Pearl Jam poster brings to mind the scene in Warrant's “Behind the Music” episode, where late frontman Jani Lane recalled seeing a label-office poster of his band replaced by one touting the new album by Alice in Chains.A biopic is, of course, going to cut corners and refocus lights, particularly when band members are involved in its production. And  does have a few points that indicate just how high-stakes and bizarre the day-to-day lives of these four guys had become, from Ozzy Osbourne’s poolside ant-hoovering to Lee finding himself on the cover of the . But the broad, tone-shifting portrayal of Mötley Crüe’s first two-ish decades results in a movie as internally conflicted as a band meeting after a blown gig—only with way less fire.",articles4,"['Lita Ford', 'Mötley Crüe', 'Tremaine', 'Amanda Adelson', 'Vince Neil', 'Mick Mars', 'Tommy Lee', 'Big\nBill', 'That’s', 'Titanic', 'Lee’s', 'Neil’s', 'Twisted Sister', 'Quiet Riot', 'Lee’s', 'Tommy Lee', 'Neil’s', 'Lee’s', 'Neil’s', 'Lee’s', 'Crüe’s', 'Tremaine', 'Pearl Jam', 'Mötley Crüe’s']"

"Users will be served customized versions of mood and event playlists based on listening historySpotify is continuing to roll out developments to its Spotify for Artists platform and playlist ecosystem. In an announcement today, the company revealed two new changes: The first is that some editorial playlists will now be partially algorithmic and “personalized,” using data to inform certain song placements in addition to the pre-existing human curation. This means that for those specific playlists, no two versions served up to different listeners will be the same.Spotify references mood and event (“making dinner,” “working out”) playlists with regard to this development, and a representative confirms that only Spotify’s own playlists will be affected by this change. Artists will be able to use the Spotify for Artists and Spotify Analytics platforms to check which of their playlist adds are algorithmic versus human-curated.The second development is that the Spotify for Artists and Spotify Analytics platforms will now also provide artists and their teams with unique hyperlinks whenever songs are added to editorial playlists, which will place the artists’ song at the top of the playlist. This is useful for artists looking to share their playlist adds and highlight their own music (as opposed to having listeners scroll down to find it). Read more on both of the changes here.Earlier this month, Spotify accused Apple of “discriminatory” and “unfair” business practices when it came to premium accounts purchased through Apple’s App Store.

"The “Empire” actor had been charged with 16 counts of felony disorderly conduct in connection with an allegedly staged attackFelony charges against “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett have been dropped, according to the ’s Madeline Buckley, TMZ, and The Blast. In addition, the judge has agreed to seal the case, and Smollett’s record will be expunged, CBS Chicago reports.Smollett made a statement after it was announced that the charges would be dropped. “I have been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one,” he said. “I would not be my mother’s son if I was capable of one drop of what I have been accused of.”Smollett’s attorneys Tina Glandian and Patricia Brown Holmes released the following statement:Today, all criminal charges against Jussie Smollett were dropped and
his record has been wiped clean of the filing of this tragic complaint
against him. Jussie was attacked by two people he was unable to
identify on January 29th. He was a victim who was vilified and made to
appear as a perpetrator as a result of false and inappropriate remarks
made to the public causing an inappropriate rush to judgement.Jussie and many others were hurt by these unfair and unwarranted
actions. This entire situation is a reminder that there should never
be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion. That is
wrong.  It is a reminder that a victim, in this case Jussie, deserves
dignity and respect. Dismissal of charges against the victim in this
case was the only just result.Jussie is relieved to have this situation behind him and is very much
looking forward to getting back to focusing on his family, friends and
career.During a joint press conference with CPD Superintendent Eddie Johnson, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel condemned Smollett and the dismissal, calling it a “whitewash of justice” and criticizing the actor for not showing remorse for the “moral and ethical wrong of his actions.”  reporter Megan Crepeau reports that the prosecution and defense in Smollett’s case reached an agreement “at some point awhile back” that the actor’s charges would be dropped “if Smollett did community service and forfeited his bond.”In an interview with CBS Chicago, First Assistant Cook County State's Attorney Joseph Magats—the prosecutor—said that the dropped charges do not vindicate or exonerate Smollett. “I do not believe he is innocent,” he said.https://twitter.com/cbschicago/status/1110634951484035074Jussie Smollett had been charged with felony disorderly conduct for allegedly filing a false police report. He turned himself in to authorities in Chicago on February 21 and was released on bond the same day. He later pled not guilty. Days following the charges, “Empire” producers announced that he would be cut from the final two episodes of the show’s current season.According to Deadline, in a joint statement following the dismissal, 20th Century Fox TV and Fox Entertainment said, “Jussie Smollett has always maintained his innocence and we are gratified that all charges against him have been dismissed.”On January 29, it was reported that Jussie Smollett had been attacked in Chicago by two men. Police initially treated the incident as a hate crime in their investigation. Smollett claimed that his assailants called him homophobic and racist slurs, put a rope around his neck, poured bleach on him, yelled “this is MAGA country,” and fled.Two men (identified as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo) were arrested and questioned by police in connection with the alleged attack on February 13. Two days later, Smollett was categorized as a suspect in the case after the Osundairos were released from police custody without criminal charges.Jussie Smollett’s family initially released a statement calling the incident an “inhumane act of domestic terrorism.” Smollett later appeared on “Good Morning America,” where he said of the alleged incident: “I’m pissed off. It’s the attackers, but it’s also the attacks.”In a new statement, Smollett’s family said, “Our son and brother is an innocent man whose name and character has been unjustly smeared.” They added, “While many were quick to rush to judgment before hearing the actual truth, we are grateful that the truth about Jussie has come to light.”Officials from the Chicago Police Department called for Smollett to apologize during a press conference held after the actor’s arrest, saying that “absolute justice would be: an apology to this city that he smeared; admitting what he did; and then be man enough to offer what he should offer up.” Authorities claimed the actor sent himself “a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic, and political language” before paying the Osundairo brothers to stage the attack on him.Update (03/30 6:02 p.m. ET): Tonight, the Chicago Police Department’s Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi tweeted a new statement from Superintendent Eddie Johnson.  Guglielmi tweeted in response to a recent New York Times article that claims Smollett’s charges were dropped due to the uncertainty of the conviction. In his statement, Johnson insisted that “front-line prosecutors were present during interrogations,” and that he stands behind “the professionalism of the detectives who worked on this case as well as the conclusions of the independent grand jury.” Read Johnson’s full statement below.https://twitter.com/AJGuglielmi/status/1112104497684377602",articles4,"['Jussie Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Today', 'Jussie Smollett', 'Rahm Emanuel', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Deadline', 'Jussie Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Abimbola Osundairo', 'Smollett', 'Jussie Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Police Department', 'Smollett', '6:02', 'Police Department', 'Guglielmi', 'Smollett']"
"In her first editor’s letter, Patel reflects on new digital cover story musician Sky Ferreira and the publication’s missionI’m usually asked the same few questions when someone learns that I’m the editor of Pitchfork.  Well, we choose an editor at random, blindfold them, spin them around three times, and have them throw a dart at a chart that is numbered from 1 to 10, meticulously, by tenths of a point.  When I buy a ticket!  It was definitely one of them, neck and neck with Snail Mail’s “Pristine.”  Exciting as hell. An impossible dream come true.When I had my first conversations about taking the helm of Pitchfork last spring, it was as a wave of overdue reckoning was just hitting the music industry. Kesha had performed “Praying” at the Grammys, a powerful anthem for silenced, wearied women everywhere. She stood on stage flanked by musical icons who, like so many others, believed that her claims of abuse against Dr. Luke were true. In the following months, it seemed like new, horrific stories came to light with a disconcerting rhythm, and necessary conversations that had once been readily swept under the rug were suddenly laid bare. Women abused by R. Kelly spoke out, which reenergized journalists to report on the singer’s alleged crimes from decades before. Label executives and music media honchos were outed for harassment, and the webs of complicity they built from manipulation and fear were exposed.It felt like a sea change, as if women in the music industry were finally being heard, as if archaic systems were crumbling under the weight of purposeful action. I was the editor of a different music publication at the time and wanted to create stories that would make an impact on a larger scale. I knew that Pitchfork was uniquely positioned to deal with the balance of thoughtful music criticism and this new landscape that was swiftly coming into view, and I knew I could help forge that path.It’s our mission at Pitchfork to serve as the “most trusted voice in music,” and doing so means doubling down on what matters to our readers. We will elevate original reporting and in-depth feature writing, create editorial packages that highlight the intersection of music and culture, raise the voices of innovative artists, and peel back the curtain on the site via our social media. We’ll also bring the same thoughtful analysis that has made our reviews section so powerful to the daily conversation around music’s biggest stories. Music is a universal language in part for how it echoes social issues, community, and identity—music shapes the way we engage with the world. This era of Pitchfork will strive to reflect that.To that end, the decision to feature Sky Ferreira for our new quarterly digital cover story was an easy one. She’s so beloved by fans and critics that the years of musical silence following the brilliance of her 2013 debut album, , felt deafening. There’s a reason for that silence, of course—there were the personal dramas, ones that stemmed at least in part from her adjacency to the bad behavior of men in her orbit, men she was then asked to account for. There were label struggles and ongoing creative tensions, daily walks down the invisible tightrope strung between anxiety and perfectionism. Sky, now 26, is returning to the spotlight cautious and resilient. As you will see in Camille Dodero’s cover story, Sky is a woman who is adamant about pursuing her work on her own terms, no matter the hurdles or industry obstacles that come her way.I’m excited to bring this story to Pitchfork readers. It’s a sign of the reporting and visual storytelling that we plan to bring to the site in the future. The story was a massive effort, requiring the collaborative energy from nearly everyone who works here, and I encourage taking a moment to watch the videos and explore the social stories for the full effect. I hope it’s as fun for you to read as it was for us to make.",articles4,"['Patel', 'Dr. Luke', 'R. Kelly', 'We’ll']"

Heaven forbid they suggest the sad, boyish charm that suited him to magazine covers in the first place.From a formative age, solitude defined Scott Walker, born Noel Scott Engel in Hamilton, Ohio. “Loneliness is the cloak you wear,” went the opening lyrics to one of his first hits, 1966’s “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore,” and those words forecast the art that followed. Whichever of his roles you’re most interested in—the ’60s British teen idol, the depressive crooner drifting toward the avant-garde, or the shadowy figure whose influence grew with each provocative release—the figure at the center is the same ghost, the same brilliant voice seeking an escape. “I’m not a recluse; I’m low key,” he told the BBC in 2006. The interviewer prods, so you’re not consciously avoiding people? “No,” he laughs. “Well,  people...”The pivotal moments of Walker’s career all speak to this elusive tendency. Around the height of the Walker Brothers’ fame in 1966, Scott retreated from the public eye to study Gregorian chant in a monastery. At the end of the decade, he returned changed, his music smokier and stranger. This became his signature trick: a disappearance back into  solitude, which would serve as the creative well for new, vivid material. In 2006, on his first album in more than a decade, he released a song called “Jesse,” which he identified as a response to 9/11. Invoking Elvis Presley’s stillborn twin as a symbol for the fallen towers, it culminated in a shaken, unaccompanied refrain: “I’m the only one left alive.” Walker’s music swallows you whole like that. It’s masterfully orchestrated to leave you alone, in the dark, without a guide.Walker was always so masterful a singer that his voice often eclipsed his other gifts. He was attractive enough to exist simply as an object of affection; literary enough to warrant a collected lyrics book; and daring enough a composer to get consistent work scoring films. And yet, Walker’s voice seems to embody all of his talents. He could have spent his whole career earning comparisons to Sinatra or charming audiences with Jacques Brel covers, but he preferred treating his baritone like the romantic subplot in a gruesome horror film. Don’t get too comfortable here, he suggests. Something terrible is about to happen.This ominous feeling connects the seemingly disparate corners of Walker’s work. He always gravitated toward string arrangements that hover in their upper registers, buzzing and vertiginous, only for his voice to swoop in like a heavy black sky under flickering stars. He loved using words and phrases you’re not supposed to sing beautifully: “jack the handle,” “stupid-ass.” On his later records, like 2006’s The Drift and 2012’s , he took this fascination to extremes, wailing about severed gonads, pretzeled intestines, tumor balloons squeaking against windows. To accompany his visions, he became increasingly abstract with his arrangements. In the 1980s, this meant instructing bandmates to record their parts before even learning the chord progressions. In the 2000s, he was demonstrating to his percussionist how to pound a slab of meat, in step. On , his final solo album, inevitably Walker conducted a symphony of farts. “A sphincter’s tooting our tune,” he sang. And so it did.If his methods sound a little like a joke, it’s one that Walker was in on. His records seem to move suite-like through fits of overwhelming bleakness and acknowledgements of the humorous absurdity therein—a juxtaposition I’ve always heard as wisdom. “It’s a strange thing,” he told  in 1966. “Things that make some people laugh, I don't laugh at at all. I go to a movie and everybody is howling away and I just sit there.” It’s not that he has no sense of humor, he insisted, but rather that his favorite jokes were the ones that no one else could see. If the world around us is pure darkness, it’s up to us to provide lightness.For all his mysteries, though, Walker’s career tells a fairly straightforward story, one of burrowing further into his vision, uncompromised and uncharted. A part of me always wondered if he would ever return to song structures as simple and beautiful as those of 1969’s , or play with contemporary aesthetics like he did on 1984’s brilliant pivot point . On that last album, Walker went through the major label motions of attempting a hit for the final time. He even made a music video, bemoaning at the time that if he were to do it down the line, he’d have to direct it himself. But he never went that route again. Like his public obligations and melodic sensibility, Walker sanded away everything he deemed unnecessary.  This meant not looking back or repeating himself. And what would there be to say? In his own words, his last full-length album was “pretty perfect” anyway.Photo by Jamie HawkesworthStill, over the years Walker seemed to grow more comfortable as a public figure. He produced Pulp’s 2001 album, , and remained a friend to Jarvis Cocker. He participated in , a 2006 documentary about his career that featured Radiohead, Brian Eno, and Sting. His final releases found him collaborating with the drone metal band Sunn O))) (on 2014’s ) and the pop singer Sia (on last year’s  score). In 2009, he recorded a song with Bat for Lashes’ Natasha Khan about a drag queen’s final performance, a collaboration that took place entirely via email. “He went away for a few days and left us to wonder what would come back,” Khan told Pitchfork. “When I heard what he did I couldn’t believe the fragility and beauty in his voice.” For a notorious hermit, he answered a lot of fan mail later in life.Walker’s legacy has thrived, in part, through these voices. During the long gaps between his releases, his influence only seemed to grow, reaching new corners and unexpected genres. Among his most notable disciples was David Bowie, who covered the Walker Brothers’ “Nite Flights” and took audible inspiration from Walker on his own final releases. In the late ’90s, BBC Radio 6 DJ Mary Anne Hobbs famously surprised Bowie with a taped message from Walker, wishing him a happy birthday. “By the way,” Walker concluded, “Mine’s the day after yours, so I'll have a drink to you on the other side of midnight.” It’s always moving to hear legends like Bowie reduced to stammering fans, but there’s a deeper poignance to the recording, indicative of the direction Walker spent his career moving. He started as an icon and only grew more human.",articles4,"['Pop Star', 'Scott Walker', 'Walker Brothers', 'Walker’s', 'Walker’s', 'Jacques Brel', 'Walker’s', 'The Drift', 'Walker’s', 'Pulp’s', 'Radiohead', 'Brian Eno', 'Sunn O', 'Lashes’', 'Pitchfork', 'Walker’s', 'Bowie']"

had loved him for years for all his incredible early work.I was extremely nervous to write to him and ask if he would consider
singing on one of my songs because he was such a legend in my eyes and
also known for being a recluse. Everyone kept saying “no chance!” But
lo and behold he wrote me a beautiful email asking all about the song,
the themes, the motivations of his character and saying he would do
it!I had sung the song in character from the perspective of a dying drag
queen. I asked Scott to be her shadow, her theatrical counterpart
voice and he was completely open to that. He went away for a few days
and left us to wonder what would come back....When I heard what he did I couldn’t believe the fragility and beauty
in his voice. It had been years since I’d heard him sing in that old
school way, and there he was in his hypnotising ghostly grandeur,

"The ’60s pop icon changed course after the Walker Brothers and enjoyed a legendary second life as an avant-garde pioneerScott Walker—the ’60s pop icon, composer, and avant-garde pioneer—died on Friday, his label 4AD announced in a statement Monday morning (March 25) and confirmed to Pitchfork. He was 76. He died of cancer in London, where he had been living since the 1960s,  reports. Walker’s career was a storied one. He started as a session musician, made huge hits with the Walker Brothers, became the object of screaming teenage fans’ adulation, and, later in life, became an enigmatic pioneer of dark and experimental avant-garde.Walker was born Noel Scott Engel in Ohio. He earned a reputation for his distinctive baritone as a 13-year-old with his single “When Is a Boy a Man.” In 1965, he moved to England and began recording with the Walker Brothers, whose song “Make It Easy on Yourself” went No. 1 in the UK and Canada. After they released “The Sun Ain’t Gonna Shine Anymore,” reports emerged of crazed fans swarming the group and toppling their car as they sat in it. In 1967, the pop sensation burned out, and Walker released the first of four solo albums, all titled .Walker’s early solo success, spearheaded by covers of Belgian chanteur Jacques Brel, granted him greater creative autonomy, and in 1969 he released , his first record comprising more original songs than covers. Its left-field compositions slowed sales, which drastically fell with the ambitious —later reappraised as a masterwork. Walker changed course, releasing a string of cover-heavy records. In 1975, he reformed the Walker Brothers and released three more albums including 1978’s , which features outré Walker compositions such as “The Electrician.”After , Walker disappeared from view for six years. In the meantime, Julian Cope expanded Walker’s cult with a compilation, . With his comeback album, 1984’s , Walker established a vanguard position he would occupy until his death. His next record, 1995’s , ventured further beyond pop’s extremities. Up until the late-’70s, he had released almost an album a year; from this point on, it was closer to one every decade. Live performances were virtually nonexistent.Several minor releases peppered his output—a soundtrack for the Leos Carax epic , collaborations with singer Ute Lemper—but his next album was 2006’s , a desolate masterpiece characterized by oblique lyrics, idiosyncratic rhythms, discordant compositions surrounded by vast audio space, and Walker’s shrill siren of a voice. One song, “Jesse,” simultaneously addressed 9/11 and the stillbirth of Elvis Presley’s twin brother. The documentary  accompanied the record’s release, complete with scenes of Walker’s band beating meat flanks for percussion, with David Bowie, Radiohead, Jarvis Cocker, Brian Eno, Damon Albarn, and others extolling Walker’s praises.His final releases were 2012’s Bish Bosch, his 2014 collaborative album with Sunn O))), Soused, and his 2016 score for The Childhood of a Leader. In 2018, he wrote and produced the score for Brady Corbet’s Vox Lux, featuring Sia. He is survived by his daughter, Lee, his granddaughter, Emmi-Lee, and his partner Beverly.This article was originally published on Monday, March 25 at 5:40 a.m. Eastern.

Peggy Gou’s “Starry Night,” her first single of the year, aims directly at that sand-between-the-toes vibe. It’s not exactly a new look for the Korean producer; much of her work falls squarely on the feel-good end of the club-music spectrum, from the breezy electro of “Han Jan” to the tropical disco-house of “It Makes You Forget (Itgehane).” “Starry Night,” from the inaugural release on her own Gudu Records, picks up the throwback sensibility of her previous singles and runs with it, propelled by gliding hi-hats, machine claps, and a staccato bassline with the faintest hint of freestyle. The glue holding it all together: bold, pumping piano chords, the ultimate signifier of house music at its balmiest. As if the point weren’t clear enough, Gou drives it home with the fragmentary images of the song’s spoken-word refrain, which bookends her trademark Korean-language verses: “Ocean! Starlight! Moment!

"Listen to the track below“Has it been even that long?” Kevin Parker echoes what we’re all thinking with his first words on Tame Impala’s comeback single, “Patience.” The four years since  mark the longest stretch of time between any of his albums, and yet that album, the Australian psych-rocker’s full-on plunge into studio auteurism, still feels fresh, the gleaming opus of a producer obsessed with fine-tuning his vision.  made Tame Impala a household name, launching them to Coachella-headliner status and inspiring superstar covers and collaborations. The band’s latest track sends a clear signal: Change is incremental.“Patience” is a yacht rock cruiser that opens with a piano riff worthy of Hall & Oates and those congas on the cover art make a big appearance. The band still seems a bit allergic to guitars for now—most of the song is driven by a rotating ensemble of rumbling bass slides and arpeggiated synths—but other well-worn Tame Impala tricks prevail. Their signature phaser effects mark the exits and entrances into verses and choruses, and the drums remain crispy (though less polished than the last go-round.)Parker remains enamored with universal notions—personal growth, , the interminable passage of time—much the same as he did on their massive single “Let It Happen.” But unlike ’ opener, “Patience” is more  than . When Parker sings, “I should be flying straight, don’t delay, ’cause time takes from everyone,” in his unmistakable reverb-laden tenor, it’s so impressively bland it feels like staring at a Magic Eye poster that never reveals anything. That said, Tame Impala manage to gracefully ride the fine line between maintaining their style and falling into self-parody. Returning with a nearly-five-minute keyboard excursion is what makes Kevin Parker the mastermind, the purveyor of vibes, so exhilarating—even if we’ve heard it all before.",articles4,"['Tame Impala', 'Tame Impala', 'Tame Impala', 'Tame Impala']"

"The American cowboy usually appears in modern pop culture as a lonesome gunslinger—a symbol of Manifest Destiny and a standard of white masculinity, a brave hero who fought the Native American “enemy.” But this John Wayne mythology is far from the truth, erasing the legacy of Native and black cowboys who existed long before a Western film was ever shot. In the 1500s, Native Americans were enlisted to drive cattle for Spanish ranchers in Mexico, eventually becoming known as . Throughout the 1800s, men of other races took up cow herding as a profession, including European immigrants, Southern settlers, and formerly enslaved African-Americans.In the past three years, a new wave of black artists have been reclaiming the cowboy archetype. Inspired by photographers like Brad Trent, Deanna Lawson, and Ron Tarver, who’ve been documenting black cowboy culture, the “yeehaw agenda” has spread across social media with a fury this year. The term was coined by the Twitter user Bri Malandro at the end of 2018, but the movement officially went viral last month when Brooklyn art critic Antwaun Sargent posted a long photo thread of black people in cowboy garb—some of musicians like Lil’ Kim and Mary J. Blige, some taken by the aforementioned photographers, and some from campaigns by the subversive black fashion designers Pyer Moss and Telfar. As others clamored to add their own pictures to Sargent’s chain, it became clear: this archive of black cowboys and cowgirls wasn’t just beautiful. To many, it was a revelation.https://twitter.com/Sirsargent/status/1091744214717734913?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwSince then, the yeehaw agenda has launched numerous primers and thinkpieces—on the historical context of black cowboy erasure, on artists like Cardi B and Kacey Musgraves wearing bedazzled chaps and 10-gallon hats, and the #YeeHawChallenge that is currently lighting up TikTok. Amid all this, women of color have incorporated elements of cowboy culture into their music over the last year. The most prominent examples are Solange and Mitski, who’ve both released stunning albums that, among other things, explore how the white cowboy mythology impacts them.In the companion film to Solange’s new LP, , she dedicates multiple sequences to capturing the majesty of black cowboys and cowgirls: their pack rides, their tenacious bull-riding, and their hypnotizing lasso tricks. For Solange, this was part of a larger mission to reclaim a piece of erased American history. “I knew from about a year and a half ago that it was really, really important to me to be a small part, in any way that I could, of telling the story of black cowboys,” she told Sargent at a screening event in her hometown of Houston earlier this month. “All of the first cowboys I saw were black…. We’ve had to constantly rewrite black history and what that means for us from the beginning of time, and so that was really just the moment to really express this culture that was so enriching for me. It’s not just an aesthetic.”Solange’s interest in Western imagery falls into a lineage of black hip-hop artists incorporating country sounds, from Bone Thugs ‘N’ Harmony and Nelly to Young Thug and her sister, Beyoncé. The yeehaw agenda, though, feels unprecedented in its reach—something Sargent suggests is rooted in an excitement of uncovering lost history. “The cowboy has meant so much to American identity,” he tells Pitchfork. “Before, there was this idea that black people were never cowboys and black people didn't have access to that quintessential part of an American identity. These images—and real history—say otherwise.”The yeehaw agenda also questions what it means to philosophically embody the cowboy—something Mitski started probing last year. She wrote 2018’s , her celebrated fifth album, from the perspective of a character channeling the cowboy’s bravado and entitlement—the antithesis of the Orientalist stereotype that Asian women are submissive and meek. In an appearance on “The Daily Show With Trevor Noah,” Mitski explained, “There’s such an arrogance and freedom to [the cowboy that] is so appealing to me, especially since I am an Asian woman. I walk into a room and I feel like I have to apologize for existing.”A newfound assuredness shows up in subtle ways throughout , manifesting in theatrical arrangements and intentional melodrama. Summer Kim Lee, a performance studies scholar at Dartmouth, notes that the cowboy persona seems to be most evident when Mitski broaches themes of chosen isolation; her song “Nobody” is, in a way, a celebration of being alone, and on “A Pearl,” the protagonist denies the touch of her partner. “The cowboy is a figure of loneliness and having open terrain. He has his boots at the door, and he’s ready to leave at any moment,” Lee tells Pitchfork. “If Kacey [Musgraves] is singing to that figure [on ‘Space Cowboy’], Mitski is saying, ‘I am that figure.’ It's not that she has someone breaking her heart; she’s the one that would actually break your heart.” Lee also suggests that there is a privilege in being able to walk away: “In terms of discussions around solidarity, people who occupy any kind of minority position can't afford to be alone.”The Japanese-born Mitski has attributed her ambivalence toward isolation to the fact that her family moved around a lot, coupled with her usual long stretches of touring these days. But her call to “be the cowboy” also takes an added meaning when considering the dichotomy between wandering cowboys and Chinese laborers, who were integral to the construction of the first Transcontinental Railroad. “Cowboys were always those who passed through, whereas Asian laborers were really tied to their work in one place,” Lee notes. An Asian woman embodying that kind of freedom is unexpected—radical, even.Mitski and Solange, as well as the larger yeehaw movement, subvert the longstanding legacy of the white cowboy by proposing that anyone can fill those boots. But being the cowboy, either mentally or aesthetically, might not necessarily be a good thing. Sargent expresses some concerns about the trend ultimately glamorizing the cowboy’s role in Western expansion. “I think it does move you away from some of those hard realities about how that westward march eradicated a Native America,” he says. “It's a complicated history.”At its best, though, this cowboy focus opens up discussions around a previously hidden part of American history, amid a country-wide identity crisis of sorts. “The idea of America is in such flux right now,” Sargent points out. “We’re having this conversation about who gets to be American, and people are reconsidering their relationship to their own their own American identities. Because the cowboy is so tied up in that [identity], we’re having these conversations about who fits into those symbols of America.” Perhaps the yeehaw agenda will prompt more people to consider how the cowboy archetype is as troubled as America’s formation. It’s a new frontier, y’all.",articles4,"['John Wayne', 'Antwaun Sargent', 'Lil’ Kim', 'Cardi B', 'Kacey Musgraves', 'Solange', 'Sargent', 'Beyoncé', 'Sargent', 'Orientalist', 'Sargent', 'Sargent']"

"Listen to the track belowBefore 2019 is through, Lizzo wants to ensure that each and every person on God’s green earth can picture her body jiggling resplendently. The real thing is not hard to track down, but “Tempo” is a sexy reminder of all that she’s working with. Lizzo starts with the chorus (“Slow songs, they for skinny hoes”), and then proceeds to lay out a succinct theory of momentum: “I'm a thick bitch, I need tempo.” That the trap-tinged track doesn’t even have that high a BPM, save for the brief breakdown just after that part, is immaterial. She’ll twerk to just about anything, especially when Missy Elliott’s her hypeman.“Tempo” joins a long line of Lizzo bops fueled by fire Instagram captions, but the mood is slightly darker here—less of a feel-good moment of empowerment, more of a straight-up  banger. Lizzo has mentioned in songs and interviews often the all-too-common hurdle facing plus-size women in the love and lust space, which is one of private adoration and public shame; here she nods to her line in “Juice” about your man sliding into her IG DMs with, “Boyfriend watchin’, oh now he wanna knuckle up.” Maybe it’s this running subtext—and the radical relief of just watching Lizzo —that takes a fun, doing-the-most rap song with a slight Missy vibe (catch Lizzo’s flow on the second verse) to the next level.

you let it. These are the things Joey and I write about now. And the

you’re cocky, you’ve got it made. Or, our life is ours to burn, to be

"The story of electronic music usually gets told against a limited set of backdrops: Detroit, Chicago, New York, Berlin, London—places where styles like house, techno, and drum’n’bass first took root before spreading outward. These aren’t the only locations of importance, but generally when people talk about dance music, they talk about a select few cities in the U.S. and Europe.These days, though, the most innovative new electronic sounds aren’t happening in those cities. For one thing, most of them have all gotten too expensive, and their scenes too complacent. The radical shifts are happening much further afield. As proof, look to Kampala, Uganda’s Nyege Nyege Tapes label, which in a few short years has become a hub for head-spinning electronic sounds from across East Africa and beyond. The styles showcased on Nyege Nyege Tapes aren’t the usual shopworn breaks and  grooves. They’re the dizzyingly fast polyrhythms of Tanzanian singeli, hurtling along at well upwards of 200 beats per minute, or the hyper-syncopated cadences and sugary harmonies of electro acholi, Northern Ugandan wedding songs remade on computers.Credit Bandcamp, in part, with helping this stuff spread around the world. Despite the label’s name, all of its releases are also available digitally, which is good, because as of this writing, every cassette and physical record in Nyege Nyege’s catalog is sold out. Credit, too, the Nyege Nyege Festival, founded in 2015 and run by the same pair of European transplants who started the label, Arlen Dilsizian and Derek Debru. Last year, it suddenly seemed that everyone in the electronic scene was talking about the four-day event, held on the banks of the Nile. Featuring performers from across Africa right alongside like-minded American and European musicians, Nyege Nyege Festival is the rare opportunity for artists from the Northern and Southern Hemispheres to connect.  even deemed it “the world’s best electronic music festival,” and just today it was announced that there will be a Nyege Nyege night as part of Red Bull’s New York music festival next month.Get in the know with nine highlights from Nyege Nyege Tapes’ growing catalog.Named in homage to a Kampala club night where the Nyege Nyege scene first coalesced, the label’s inaugural release is by Disco Vumbi, aka Kenya’s Alai K, who recorded with locals Martin Juicy Fonkodi and the Nilotica Drum Ensemble during a residency in the Ugandan capital. The four-track EP showcases a hybrid sound that weaves together stomping electronic drums, sampled percussion, and bright, guitar-like melodies based on Kenyan benga.A little like Omar Souleyman, who performs Syrian wedding songs over digital keys and programmed drums, the Ugandan singer Otim Alpha and producer Leo Palayeng take the traditional Larakaraka wedding music of the Acholi people of Northern Uganda and South Sudan and remake it with computer software. The results translate the style’s fluid syncopations for a brittle, glassy sound that rattles like a bag of marbles. The synths and electronic drum sounds are bright and overdriven, suggesting busted car stereos and blown-out PAs, while Alpha’s multi-tracked vocals and resonant stringed instruments balance the lo-fi sonics with layers of warmth.Not everything on Nyege Nyege Tapes is strictly electronic. Nihiloxica are a nine-person percussion group performing traditional Bugandan drumming fleshed out with kit drums and synths. Their debut EP has an eerie, almost gothic cast, with digital synths fizzing and rumbling around hypnotic, polyrhythmic grooves. All four tracks were recorded live in Boutiq Studios; to really get a sense of their virtuosity, check out their live videos.Nyege Nyege Tapes’ scope isn’t limited to Uganda. The most brain-scrambling sound the label has yet to surface is singeli, a hyperspeed style native to Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, roughly 1,000 miles to the southeast of Kampala. Cobbled together out of sped-up loops sampled from other regional styles, singeli is pop music in Tanzania. But unlike some of the sleek, radio-ready versions of this phenomenon—“Dab Singeli,” anyone?—the sounds coming out of Sisso Studios are raw and unhinged, with chintzy synth patterns and sampled drum loops sped up so fast, they sound like a cassette deck with the fast-forward button glued down. The further the internet reaches, the harder it becomes to discover something that sounds startlingly new, which makes an encounter with singeli all the more thrilling.Another affiliate of Dar Es Salaam’s Sisso Studios crew turns in an even more unhinged take on the singeli sound, spinning rapid-fire mbira loops, programmed drumming, and tinny keys into a whirlwind blur that makes even the most uptempo strains of European dance music sound anemic by comparison. For a similarly breathtaking example of this highly specific sound, check out Jay Mitta’s .Nyege Nyege Tapes’ Hakuna Kulala sublabel is dedicated to more experimental and futuristic sounds. (I like to think that its mosquito logo is a suggestion of the sounds contained within: rapid-moving, slightly menacing, and distinguished by buzzing frequencies.) Slikback, whose debut  EP launched the offshoot, is one of Nyege Nyege’s greatest success stories so far. The Kenyan electronic musician only began making music a couple of years ago, and he quickly amassed a catalog several hundred tracks deep. He played multiple sets at Nyege Nyege Festival last fall and then a month later played three more sets at Poland’s Unsound; his 2019 calendar includes gigs at CTM, Sónar, and Dekmantel, along with a string of dates across China., which served as Hakuna Kulala’s inaugural release last June, is a fearsome blast of global club styles, with choppy synths and vocal samples sprayed over booming 808 kicks and beats that draw equally from Portuguese batida, UK bass, and Southern trap. He followed it up last month with , a six-track EP capturing an even darker, more agitated snapshot of his global club sound.Heard out of context, this album might not immediately scan as African music. The percussive zaps are reminiscent of the Finnish group Pan Sonic’s icy minimalism; the glowering synth buzz suggests Berlin industrial drone at its most austere. But this isn’t techno. The loping polyrhythms come from the traditional Maloya music of Jako Maron’s native Réunion Island, 587 miles west of Madagascar. In the late 1990s, Maron began working with modular synthesizers and drum machines, refashioning Maloya drumming’s intricate pulses for an all-electronic setup, and the results are as hypnotic as they come, no matter your frame of reference.While most Nyege Nyege Tapes releases are determinedly future-focused, the catalog also includes archival projects. This anthology collects the work of Ekuka Morris Sirikiti, a Northern Ugandan griot and master of the lukeme, a small thumb piano with metal tines that’s often known as an mbira. But Eukuka does have one technological twist: All the selections collected here come from an array of home recordings of radio broadcasts, meaning that everything is rinsed in multiple washes of static and tape hiss. The really garbled transmissions, like “Acoc Acoc Twol Iye Akayi,” end up sounding like the East African equivalent of lo-fi tape music.If you thought Sisso Studios’ Bamba Pana and Jay Mitta were hardcore, wait ’til you hear Duke, a member of Dar Es Salaam’s Pamoja Records crew. Often overlaid with raspy, sped-up rapping from local MCs like MCZO, Don Tach, and Dogo Liz, Duke’s drums move so fast that they compress entire bars into the space of a single beat. Consider him the Squarepusher of Dar Es Salaam, perhaps: His beats are nimbly hyperkinetic and infused with eerie dissonance. And when he really goes all out, it sounds like punk, basically, just arrived at by different means, but still fundamentally fast, cheap, and thrillingly out of control.",articles4,"['Tapes', 'Credit', 'Red Bull’s New York', 'Disco Vumbi', 'Martin Juicy Fonkodi', 'Alpha’s', 'Tapes', 'Jay Mitta’s', 'Slikback', 'Hakuna Kulala’s', 'Sonic’s', 'Jako Maron’s', 'Tapes', 'Jay Mitta', 'MCZO', 'Duke’s']"
"Listen to the track belowFor every self-styled provocateur, there is an endpoint—when your pointed bons mots and “misunderstood” inflammatory statements fall on deaf ears. The stage is yours, but the rafters are empty. That moment has not quite yet arrived for Morrissey—after all, he recently sold out a string of Broadway shows—but he has always carried himself with the morose grandeur of a former titan grousing at the smallness of the pictures. His version of Roy Orbison’s “It’s Over,” the first single from the upcoming covers album , found him in an uncharacteristically shaky voice, perhaps quaking in the shadow of one of the greatest vocalists of all time.The second single is “Morning Starship,” a cover of the 1973 glam-rock song from Bruce Wayne Campbell, aka Jobriath. Morrissey is in sturdier shape, but his delivery is missing all of its bite—it sounds dispiritingly like a man at a karaoke bar giving his best Morrissey impression. Grizzly Bear’s Ed Droste is here, somewhere, doing... something—perhaps that is him, singing backing “oh” vocals, millions of miles in the distance in the mix. The arrangement, pumped full of electric guitar leads, drifts from the faux-Bowie stage setting of the original into generic Any-Rock territory. No matter how many dispiriting or alarming news items Morrissey might be generating as of late, you can usually count on him to muster a sense of occasion when he steps into a recording booth. This is Morrissey Minus Morrissey—the voice is there, but the presence has been leached out.",articles4,"['Broadway', 'Roy Orbison’s', 'Jobriath', 'Ed Droste']"

"Listen to the track belowCate Le Bon writes songs in the absurdist tradition, as both as an escape and a mirror to the world.

Maim” video, directed by herself and her brother Mac.January 23, 2016: On tour in Seoul, Grimes busts out a rendition of “Ave Maria,” which she previously noted “might be one of [her] all-time favorite songs.” She later turns the cover into a full-fledged electro suite alongside her most frequent collaborator as of late, the rising synth-pop artist HANA.April 16, 2016: During her Coachella performance, Grimes subtly endorses Bernie Sanders by flashing an illustration of him on the big screen behind her.May 9, 2016: Grimes debuts a new country-glam video for “California,” featuring an alternate version of the  single and guest-stars including Purity Ring’s Megan James and model Eric Cheng.August 3, 2016: Considering Grimes’ penchant for superhero cosplay in her imagery, it comes as no surprise when she contributes a new song to the  soundtrack, titled “Medieval Warfare.”August 12, 2016: Grimes, along with Noah “40” Shebib and Imagine Dragons, announce their roles in curating the soundtrack for the “NBA 2K17” video game.

Four come from songs off : “World Princess Part II,” “Butterfly,” “Scream,” and best of all, “Belly of the Beat,” a visual homage to Kate Bush. The remaining three videos are for songs by HANA.November 2, 2016: Always one to champion the democratization of music production, Grimes contributes an original “sound pack” of samples for Roli Blocks, a portable keyboard that supposedly makes it really easy to create music. Hers is called “Electromagnetic Pulse” and it sounds half-robotic, half-mystical.November 8, 2016: Grimes recreates an iconic 1964 pro-Lyndon B. Johnson ad in support of Hillary Clinton.

Unfortunately, Boucher does not appear in the track’s incredible video, which features an abundance of vagina pants.May 7, 2018: After a swirl of dating rumors, Grimes and Elon Musk attend the Met Gala together; some wonder if the simulation is glitching, others make  jokes.

"The news emerged this week that, amid a data migration project, Myspace had deleted all the music uploaded to its site between 2003 and 2015—an estimated 53 million files. That is poor archiving, to be sure, particularly given the role the social network played for music in the pre-streaming era. In the mid-2000s, Myspace helped to launch young acts into the millennial zeitgeist, from Lily Allen to Arctic Monkeys, and served as a digital watering hole for fans of emo and beyond. The songs that artists and users alike uploaded to their pages, via MP3s, were key to the semi-legal discovery methods of the ’00s.But what is most telling about this massive loss of digital data is that it actually happened months ago, and few seemed to take notice of or complain about the broken links. Which would seem to make the Myspace story less about a loss of information, than about a loss of interest.I don’t mean a loss of interest in any particular music among those 50 million files—each of those songs holds greater and lesser meaning to different individuals. But the larger disregard of Myspace suggests a collective loss of interest in the type of history we associate with archives—a reconstruction of a specific moment in the past. Digital media never allow for that kind of stopped time. Myspace was always in flux, just as all websites are. How do you archive an interactive, ever-changing space?The digital environment presents all kinds of pitfalls to traditional archiving. Not only is the subject constantly changing, it is often locked into proprietary formats directed by commercial interests. The resulting tragicomedy is perhaps best illustrated by the modern Domesday Book. The original, an exhaustive survey of life in Britain produced in 1086 for William the Conqueror, is still in existence, and easily consulted by historians. In 1986, 900 years later, the BBC (together with a group of corporate sponsors) undertook a digital update, soliciting contributions from a million school children and spending millions of pounds to compile two LaserDiscs of video, audio, and data in a Philips format called LV-ROM. By 2002, no one could open it. Various attempts have been made since to recapture the contents, with only limited and temporary success.It’s follies like this that have led some to speculate about a “digital dark age,” a period of history that will be largely blank due to lost information—like a giant broken link when the future tries to look back at our time. It’s not hard to imagine, because living and working with digital media is to continually lose access even to one’s own past.If I try and count the formats I’ve already lived through, I can feel like a very old man. My career as a musician started in the late 1980s, first in the band Galaxie 500 and then as Damon & Naomi, which means I now have closets filled with superannuated digital audio media: PCM, DAT, ADAT, minidisc... And because my bandmate Naomi and I publish books under the imprint Exact Change, we also have boxes of antique data storage systems: floppy disks, Bernoulli boxes, Zip disks, and hard drives with ports whose names I’ve lost along with the cables that fit them. Few if any would work, I am sure, even if I could somehow plug them in.I don’t even know why I’ve kept so many of these physical containers of digital data, except that when each appeared it seemed most useful, ironically, for archiving purposes. And so Naomi and I treated them that way, moving our data that we hoped to preserve from one to the next, to the next. Not to mention endlessly translating that data between programs, as we seek to keep these digital files we save useable. Regardless, failures crop up all the time: an unreadable document, a font that will no longer open, a corrupted file.Meanwhile, we periodically spit out records and books in the formats that were already old when I was born—vinyl and paper. And those are doing just fine, thanks. We store our LPs upright and we print on acid-free paper. Whenever Naomi and I have used our amorphous digital files to output an analog product, we have had no problem contributing to the kind of history that we were born into: one made of things that fit on shelves in analog archives and that stay put there. But our digital archives have behaved according to an entirely different paradigm—always in flux, and always tending toward inaccessibility, and ultimately invisibility. Perhaps they want to disappear.We may indeed be living in a digital dark age. But what I can’t picture is why this digital dark age will ever end, what would cause a future renaissance to cast it in retrospective shadow. Might it be that the digital era is not only difficult to archive, but anti-historical? That’s what the Myspace incident suggests to me, above all. It’s not just that the files are lost—that’s an experience familiar to anyone working in digital media. It’s that no one was looking for them.Damon & NaomiGalaxie 500Exact Changechallenging the streaming industry Ways of Hearing, podcast of the same name",articles4,"['Galaxie 500', 'Damon & Naomi', 'ADAT']"

"Listen to the track belowThe latest song from Weyes Blood’s forthcoming album Titanic Rising opens with Natalie Mering singing in her mezzo range: “This is how it feels to be in love.” She sounds so in the thrall of emotion that what follows is not some simple description, but a rapturous monologue to herself, unconcerned with melodrama or cliche. This is how it feels: like starring in your own movie, like being suspended in disbelief, like the romance of all the dashed hopes and dreams we see on the silver screen. “Movies” exists at the very peak of feeling, where there is no air, just a kind of dizzying survey of thoughts and memories. And Mering knows one doesn’t simply ascend the grand staircase of emotion without arpeggios. The music behind her billowy voice begins with a crab walk across a synth. Halfway through, the synths disappear and the real cellos arrive as the song grows to five times its original size—it practically steps off of the screen and comes to life.",articles4,['Weyes Blood’s']

"What it was like recording , according to John Key and John Carroll Kirby, who appear on almost every single songWhen Solange released her new album , the credits were stacked with an eclectic and impressive mix of collaborators, including Tyler, the Creator, Animal Collective’s Panda Bear, Gucci Mane, Playboi Carti, and Pharrell—just to name a few. But two names that consistently popped up on almost every single song were less recognizable: John Key and John Carroll Kirby. So who are these guys?Based in New Orleans, musician/producer John Key is Solange’s touring drummer; he began playing shows with her during her tour behind 2016’s . Los Angeles-based John Carroll Kirby first met Solange in the early 2010s through mutual friend Aaron Pfenning, the former Chairlift member who put out a single with Solange under his Rewards moniker back in 2011. Later, Kirby appeared on , contributing to “Cranes in the Sky,” “Borderline (An Ode To Self Care),” and “Junie.”Key and Kirby met for the first time when Solange brought them together to work on , which was recorded largely in temporary studios set up in Airbnbs across Laurel Canyon, L.A., Houston, and Jamaica. To set the mood, Solange lit candles, kept Florida Water on hand, and decorated with printouts of cowboys and crop circles. Rather than guiding her collaborators with direction or explanation, she just let the tape roll, producing lengthy one-take jam sessions to be edited down later.Over the phone, Key and Kirby talked about Solange’s atypical recording style, her mood board obsession, and more.How did Solange enlist you to work on ?Kirby: Before we even had songs for , we were kind of doing different jams. One time we were in the studio and we were doing an exercise where we were making a song based on one word. The only one of those that ever came out was in the Terence Nance show  It’s called “Onyx.” That was kind of like a precursor to .Key: For me, it was a natural progression because we were already on the road together. [The tour rehearsals] were creative, so eventually me and her just started going to the studio towards the end of the tour and started jamming together.How did the initial jam sessions you laid down for  turn into finished tracks?Kirby: Things are so loose in the beginning. We would be recording and sometimes the engineer would be like, “Just give me one second to find a tempo and set up a click track.” And the momentum was so fast that we’d just be like, “No, no, no, just put it down.” Sometimes we were just like, “Leave it on record.” Solange has a really cool editing process where she sort of refined and shaved things back. Then from there, she would bring in a guest vocalist once the track was the way she wanted it.Key: It wasn’t the type of vibe where you pull up 50 beats. It was more like, she may have a bassline idea or a melody with some chords in her head. Or I may have some chords. John Kirby may have the drum loop. It would grow into a jam session from there and there could be 20 takes just rolling for 25-30 minutes.Kirby: Solange did a really cool thing I’ve never seen anyone do. We had a beat, but we didn’t know what the chords were. She’d say, “All right, give me a vocal track,” and she’d sing one line real slow. Then she says, “Give me another one” and she’d overdub on top of that another part again and again [creating harmony]. She makes chord changes with her vocals. It’s kind of wild.I imagine that improvisational recording style is something that would be more common for a jazz band than a R&B singer-songwriter.Kirby: As we were working, Solange was always kind of joking like, “this is a jazz album.” I mean, half joking, because in a way it is. But she was always saying, “I’m going to release it on iTunes or Spotify in the jazz category.”Did she do anything to the studio environment to set the vibe? Because I feel like she is the kind of person who would light a candle, like in the “Binz” video.Kirby: Yep, there were candles. Florida Water.Key: Yeah, definitely candles. I felt it was more so being able to pick the right people and the right energy. Everyone she brought into the room, we all gelled naturally. I’ve made some of the best music I’ve made in my life with John Kirby and Solange, and it was technically my first time working with both.Kirby: The one thing that I was tripping out on was—those images of cowboys, crop circles, all that imagery, Solange had actually printed out as a mood board. Most of the time we wouldn’t be working in a recording studio. [We would] rent an Airbnb and convert that. She would print those images out and put them up in the “studio.” She didn’t say a ton about it, but they were always up and it was always unspoken. Then it was so cool to see the music video done like, “Oh shit, that’s what she had in mind the whole time.”Were all the collaborators overdubbed, or did they come into sessions?Kirby: Tyler, the Creator came in, that was awesome. He would just hop on whatever it was, keyboards or drums, just whatever was open, and just play something sick every time, telling crazy stories and stuff. Sampha came in towards the end when she was working on the lyrics and she was joking with him like, “If you help me with these lyrics, I’m probably going to get you to sing them.” And that ended up happening [on “Time (Is)”]. Metro Boomin came in, that was cool. We went to Portugal to work with Panda Bear, and “Binz” came out of that.What was it like working with Panda Bear?Key: He’s a really dope musician. That’s him playing drums on “Binz.” I didn’t even know he was a drummer, so that was the coolest thing.Do you guys have any other solo projects going on?Kirby: Yeah, I’ve got a solo record coming out. I started a band with Sébastian Tellier and Daniel Stricker called Mind Gamers, we got an album coming out. And I’ve been working with a guy named Eddie Chacon—his band back in the day was called Charles & Eddie. He’s making a comeback after a long hiatus from music.Key: I’ve recently been working on a few records with Brent Faiyaz. Doing some production, drums, bass, a little bit of everything. And also gearing up to get back on the road with Solange, just getting back in my live vibe.",articles4,"['John Key', 'Animal Collective’s', 'John Key', 'John Key', 'Solange', 'Rewards', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange’s', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'harmony].', 'Solange', 'Everyone', 'Solange', 'Sampha', 'I’m', 'Panda Bear', 'Charles & Eddie', 'Brent Faiyaz', 'Solange']"

"In a career that spanned 60 years, Dick Dale didn’t once crack ’s Top 40. He’s also not in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. And if you look in any of the classic, old-school record guides—those published by  in the ’70s and ’80s, Dave Marsh’s singles-centric , and more—you’ll find that his name isn’t there, either. Each absence reflects a collective bias against the rock’n’roll made during the early 1960s, an era often portrayed in history books as the dead zone separating Elvis and the Beatles. Even the “King of the Surf Guitar,” the title Dale gave himself via his 1963 LP of the same name, carries an air of dismissiveness: Dick Dale may reign, but only over a kingdom that wasn’t much more than a novelty lasting a few years during the JFK Administration.Dale’s music evokes a specific time and place, one that is embedded in the popular subconscious. That’s one of the reasons why Quentin Tarantino chose Dale’s “Miserlou,” a 1962 adaptation of a traditional Middle Eastern song, to soundtrack the opening credits of his 1994 masterwork, . The song’s cavernous reverb and pounding beat immediately conjure dreams of the California coast, but there’s another crucial element at play: the sound is visceral, as violent as a pistol crack, commanding attention from Dale’s first pick scrape down his fretboard. “Miserlou” aims straight for the gut, but the secret to its success—and why Dale’s music endures—is how it blends muscle and mind, connecting at a gut level while expanding sonic horizons.Think of the very sound of Dick Dale’s guitar, how it rumbles and echoes, mimicking the sound of water rising and crashing. This was a deliberate move on his part. The guitarist was also a surfer and he wanted his music to capture the experience of riding waves. Dale maintained that the key to surf rock is in the rhythm, how it mimics the rush of the water. He cited jazz drummer Gene Krupa as his principal influence, and indeed you can hear how that manifested in Dale’s frenzied staccato picking. He preferred an explosion of noise over hooky riffs—an approach so ahead of its time, early-’60s guitar technology couldn’t support it.Luckily enough, Southern California was also the home of Leo Fender, a pioneer of the electric guitar. Fender introduced the Stratocaster in 1954 and its solid body construction became popularized by Buddy Holly and Ritchie Valens not much later, yet Dale is who really pushed the limits of the Strat, not to mention Fender’s amplification. Leo Fender heard tale of Dale’s riotous concerts at the Rendezvous Ballroom in Orange County, where the guitarist continually pushed his amps to the point of destruction in pursuit of a throttling sound that emphasized the low end. Soon enough, Fender was working with the guitarist to develop one of the first “stacked” guitar amps, where the amplifier box rested upon the speaker cabinet; Leo named the Showman in tribute to Dick’s skills as a performer.It took some effort to get the Showman as loud as Dale desired. According to the guitarist, they went through nearly 50 amps before Fender developed one that could withstand his demands: to deliver a blow so punishing, crowds could feel it in the venue parking lot. When that was finally achieved, the overwhelming volume created a buzz through Southern California, with surfers and teenagers flocking to see Dale play live. A few months later, another new gadget developed by Fender and Dale caused a similar commotion: the reverb unit, which became part of the guitarist’s rig in 1961.Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty ImagesEcho wasn’t unheard of in popular music in the early ’60s, but it usually was a product of the studio. Sam Phillips slapped on a doubleback echo at his Sun Studio, creating a delay by recording a playback while cutting a group playing live, while Duane Eddy’s trembling tremolo on 1958’s “Rebel-’Rouser” opened the door for the kind of guitar instrumental that would become Dale’s specialty. Inspired by the swirling sounds of the Hammond organ’s reverb tank, Dale wanted to bring that kind of enveloping echo to the stage. Through some trial and error, Fender channeled this into a pedal that drastically expanded Dale’s tonal options. Where he once slashed and stabbed with his Strat, Dale could now paint with reverb. Famously, this effect was dubbed “wet,” which was all too appropriate for surf rock. The term also captured how the music seemed warm and alive, dripping with colors.This twin innovation of crushing volume and mind-expanding effects was an immediate sensation in the region. Countless SoCal bands coveted this charged, electric sound, snapping up Stratocasters and offshoots like the Jazzmaster and Jaguar, running them through Fender amps and reverb boxes. And many of these groups went onto greater commercial success than Dick Dale. It’s not just that the Beach Boys melded barbershop harmonies to the rumbling surf rock beat, thereby turning it into pop music. Other local bands swiped Dale’s ideas, then gave them stronger hooks and melodies. The Chantays built “Pipeline” around that wet Fender echo, taking it all the way to No. 3 in 1963, a little over a year after Dale’s “Let’s Go Trippin’”—by most accounts, the first-ever surf rock instrumental—topped out at No. 60 on the Hot 100 chart.Dale never achieved such commercial heights, but it wasn’t for a lack of trying. During the first half of the ’60s, he kept chasing the charts, recording endless variations on “Let’s Go Trippin’” and “Miserlou”—in addition to blatant rewrites of the two, there were the explicit ripoffs “Let’s Go Trippin’ ’65” and “Misirlou Twist”—and happily adapting to the hot rod craze, which brought the echoing rumble of surf rock inland. What these records had in common was an eagerness to exploit whatever teenage craze swept through Southern California, along with Dale’s modest vocal skills. He was a guitarist, not a singer, when he was working a club into a frenzy. It was an ideal formula for live gigs and made for pretty entertaining records too, just not ones that produced hits, especially after the British Invasion made these kind of all-American good times seem somewhat square.The latter-day ubiquity of “Miserlou” tends to obscure Dale’s lack of crossover success. After , “Miserlou” was everywhere: other movies, TV shows, commercials, bumper music, a sample by the Black Eyed Peas on their 2006 hit “Pump It.” With his popularity boosted, Dale spent much of the last 25 years of his life on the road—which was fortunate albeit depressing, since he needed to play gigs in order to cover his medical bills. Health had been a problem for Dale since the mid-’60s, when his career was stopped short so he could recover from rectal cancer. His diagnosis arrived right when surf rock fell out of favor. The end of his contract with Capitol wrapped up in 1965, after the label put out a live album; he had been signed a mere three years.Dale decided to walk away from music after his illness, his retreat leading Jimi Hendrix to sing “you’ll never hear surf music again” on his 1967 song “Third Stone From the Sun.” Always one to spin a yarn, Dale declared responsibility for Hendrix, and while the details are almost certainly exaggerated—there’s little chance the surfer taught Jimi how to play guitar—there’s also a germ of truth to his claim of as much. Dale played his Stratocaster upside down, leaving the bass strings at the bottom instead of moving them to the top—a move mirrored by Hendrix, who wound up restringing the guitar so it followed a conventional pattern. More importantly, Hendrix picked up where Dale left off in terms of sonic experimentation, adding an arsenal of effects that would’ve been unimaginable without Dale’s groundbreaking work in the early years of the decade.Often, this connection is framed as Dick Dale being the “Father of Heavy Metal,” a designation that’s logical without necessarily being accurate. Certainly, he’s the guitarist responsible for pushing guitar tech to embrace the outer limits of volume and experimentation, chasing a sound that existed only in his head. Similarly, his furious picking prized velocity and strength in a way that was simply unheard in rock’n’roll prior to his arrival. Some pickers were fleet and dextrous, creating quick and focused solos—think of Chuck Berry or Scotty Moore, who backed Elvis Presley in the early days—while others moved slowly; Link Wray may have invented the power chord with 1958’s “Rumble,” but that crawled by with menace. Dale married these approaches, creating the blueprint for overdriven guitar heroics, but he wasn’t solely about pure power.Within Dale’s music lay the possibility that rock’n’roll could be cinematic, too. (Chalk that up to the wet reverb.) His was a transportive sound: it just  like the ocean, stretching out as far as the eye can see. Other musicians would pick up that thread, creating aural vistas that were entirely imaginary, while others would incorporate that reverberating echo in ways that nodded to the roiling roll of surf rock. It’s possible to hear traces of Dale in sleaze merchants the Cramps, who harnessed his vigor for exploitation, or within the astral dimensions of the Grateful Dead’s “Dark Star,” just like it’s possible to hear his snap and thunder within the solos of Stevie Ray Vaughan and his disciples. Dick Dale created the vernacular they all share.",articles4,"['Dave Marsh’s', 'Elvis', 'Beatles', 'Administration', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Dick Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Luckily', 'Buddy Holly', 'Ritchie Valens', 'Dale’s', 'Dick’s', 'Sam Phillips', 'Duane Eddy’s', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Jazzmaster', 'Beach Boys', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Dale’s', 'Health', 'Jimi Hendrix', 'Hendrix', 'Stratocaster', 'Hendrix', 'Hendrix', 'Dale’s', '(Chalk', 'Grateful Dead', 'Dark Star', 'Stevie Ray Vaughan']"

"Dubbed “Mr. Rhythm” and “The Godfather of Rap,” Williams died after a battle with colon cancerR&B singer and producer Andre Williams has died, his record label Pravda Records confirmed. He was 82. In a statement, the label said he died on Sunday, March 17 in Chicago. “He touched our lives and the lives of countless others,” it reads. Williams’ manager revealed to Billboard that the singer was diagnosed with colon cancer two weeks ago and passed away while in hospice care.Zephire “Andre” Williams was born and raised in Bessember, Alabama before moving to Detroit in the 1950s in pursuit of a music career. Still a teenager, he became involved with R&B-focused label Fortune Records. He sang for the 5 Dollars group and released solo singles like “Greasy Chicken” and “Jail Bait,” which became some of his greatest hits. The 1957 song “Bacon Fat” showcased the sing-talk style that earned Williams the “Godfather of Rap” nickname. He was also billed as “Mr. Rhythm” during his run with Fortune.In the 1960s, Williams began working with Motown, which included co-writing Stevie Wonder’s “Thank You For Loving Me,” working with the Temptations, and producing for various groups like the Contours. During this time, he released his hits “Cadillac Jack,” “The Stroke,” and “Humpin’ Bumpin’ & Thumpin’.” Williams would go on to record with Parliament, Ike & Tina Turner (who famously performed Williams’ “Shake a Tail Feather”), the Red Hot Chilli Peppers, and others, as well as releasing his own studio records like 1998’s Gories-featuring  and 2000’s .

Dale’s live bassist Sam Bolle confirmed the news to . He was 81. A rocker whose career bloomed in the early 1960s, Dale toured into the end of his life despite “excruciating” pain stemming from numerous health problems (including rectal cancer, kidney failure, diabetes, and damaged vertebrae). He had tour dates planned throughout 2019.Dale was born Richard Monsour in Boston to a Polish mother and Lebanese father. In the late 1950s, he picked up surfing and subsequently decided to create a guitar sound that invoked the feeling of the sport. Dale’s staccato picking technique, use of reverb, and implementation of Middle Eastern and Eastern European melodies defined his sound.He’s widely credited for inventing the surf guitar genre. Dale also worked with Leo Fender to develop the first 100-watt amplifier—a necessity given how many amplifiers he destroyed from playing at excessively high volumes. Dale’s most famous work was the song “Misirlou,” which director Quentin Tarantino famously used in the opening credits of .Dale once said in an interview that he wanted to die “onstage in an explosion of body parts.” He continued:“You tell the people, ‘Don’t be scared of dying.' When your mind leaves this body, it is a beautiful thing and it is not to be feared. Don’t let that fear of dying affect the way you live. You take that fear and you use it as a driving force to keep moving forward, no matter how much pain you have. That’s how I do what I do on stage.

"Lindy West has been immersed in music her entire life. Her father, Paul West, was a lounge-y pianist around Seattle. She sang in choir and played multiple instruments growing up. She married a jazz musician, the experimental trumpeter and comedian Ahamefule J. Oluo. But the Seattle-based writer remains steadfast in the belief that her musical taste has always been uncool. “I think the band that I’ve seen live the most times is Tenacious D,” she admits not long after we get on the phone one recent afternoon.This is not exactly the musical vibe of “Shrill,” the new Hulu dramedy adapted from West’s brilliant memoir of the same name. Angel Olsen has two songs in the six-episode first season, and “Voice of a Generation,” by the Oi! band Blitz, plays as a cheeky wink while the protagonist’s ex-punk boss throws a tantrum about not being The Man. “If anyone had a hand in steering the music, it was Aidy [Bryant],” says West of the show’s lead, who plays Portland alt-weekly journalist Annie Easton. “She has a really clear vision about everything.”Watching “Shrill” is a bit disorienting if you’ve followed West’s career, which took her from blogging about film and fat acceptance at  to writing high-profile columns for the  and . Annie is like Lindy but also isn’t. For one, even though West is a writer on the series, there’s no great way to take personal essays about specific life events and create entire characters out of them. What the two share, most crucially, is the sense that they are fat everywomen navigating the bumpy but thrilling waters of self acceptance. And for once, thank god, that role doesn’t include being the “sassy,” forever-single sidekick.Ahead of the “Shrill” premiere on March 15, West—who served as an executive producer—called us up to discuss what’s been on her stereo of late.I listen to this song all the time because it’s a true classic. But I’ve also been thinking a lot about the fat women I saw in media growing up, and the video for this song had a huge impact on me as a kid. What happens is, there are three women, and two of the women are conventionally beautiful and of course they’re wearing sexy negligees. And then there’s Carnie [Wilson], who is bigger. She’s way smaller than I am, but her size reads as fat in the context of television. They’re at the beach, five feet from the ocean, and Carnie’s wearing a fucking zoot suit!People made fun of Carnie all the time, but she got to be part of a glamorous pop group. Her existence was a big deal to me. And as I was listening to the song recently, I thought:  That moment made me feel like, hopefully, this show will make a little bit of a difference for the Carnies of the future.I’m obviously obsessed, to the point where I’m like, “Can she act? Will she be on the show?” She’s using her body in such a powerful way, presenting herself as the sexiest person on earth not despite her body but because of it. Beth Ditto [from Gossip] did a version of that, but Lizzo’s doing it with such joy and such defiance. And it’s really working! People are like, “Yeah, Lizzo is the sexiest person I’ve ever seen.”If I ever listen to anything highbrow, it’s because of my husband, who pays attention to everything. He got really into this album [when it was reissued in 2017] and started listening to it constantly. Then I started playing it because I’m working on a new book, and it’s the perfect thing to listen to while writing. When you’re nearing deadline and you feel like death is coming for you, this is just incredibly soothing to your brain. But I’ve got to say, it’s also as close to pop music as ambient music gets. It doesn’t waste any time or any notes, it’s extremely efficient and well-crafted. As a person in the process of crafting a book, that’s really inspiring.What’s happening with R. Kelly and Michael Jackson is making me want to only listen to female singer-songwriters from the ’90s. I want to get far away from men. I want to go back in time and reminisce about high school, which maybe has something to do with watching “PEN15” as well. Also, I keep listening to songs about resistance and revolution from previous decades that, maybe at the time, I didn’t understand.There’s something so heartbreaking about warnings we ignored, like Tracy Chapman saying poor people are going to rise up. But there’s also something pure about hope from 20 years ago that I just want to tap into. It was stigmatized to be sincere in the ’90s. You were supposed to be marinated in irony and detachment. I didn’t know how to absorb messages like this then. And now, all I want is sincerity.Watch “Shrill” now on Hulu.",articles4,"['Angel Olsen', 'Blitz', 'The Man', 'Annie', 'West', 'I’m']"

"Listen to the track belowNihilists have always reached their full potential in Los Angeles and in “Wasted Youth,” they have a new anthem. The latest single from their hometown hero and former Rilo Kiley singer Jenny Lewis offers up a full Moleskine of cynical observations, gesturing with her half-empty highball until the liquor sloshes onto some unspecified, unarmed lover. “Why you lyin’? The bourbon’s gone/Mercury hasn’t been in retrograde for that long,” she drawls, her gorgeous pop-country voice whetted to a fine point. It’s the kind of arch, staccato rebuttal that kicks us from our autopilot. In Lewis’ voice, this dynamic has drawn back many nights in this tavern, and she’s at the dregs.As the third track released from , “Wasted Youth” feels like a deliberate tonal counterpoint to tease the album. It’s a deceptively chirpy turn from the second single “Heads Gonna Roll,” an ambling symphonic folk ballad, and the alluring, exuberant “Red Bull & Hennessey,” in which she beckons all similarly wild souls with a wink and a Stevie Nicks shimmy. By comparison, “Wasted Youth” is a lament, especially when she directs the venom inward—“I wasted my youth on a poppy,” she keens, presaging the tough reckonings she faces throughout the album: addiction, heartbreak, deaths in her family.

"Listen to the track belowCreating the start-up music for a new piece of technology is a time-honored tradition for bona fide artists. Just ask Brian Eno, who was tasked with evoking “inspiring, universal, futuristic” feelings—all in the span of 3.25 seconds—with his now-iconic sound for Microsoft’s Windows 95 operating system. Eno wisely compared the process to “making a tiny jewel,” a piece of micro-music that must stand the test of time (and the scrutiny of soulless execs).Arca—the electronic maverick and Björk collaborator whose work pushes the boundaries of both avant-garde and pop—has composed a 12-second cue for the Mega Sg, a detailed re-imagining of the Sega Genesis game system. It is possibly one of the most hopeful-sounding bits of music Arca has ever released, like a chillier take on the effervescent strum of Nintendo’s Gameboy Advance music. It’s more  than the ravier tendencies displayed on the original Sony PlayStation’s beloved load-in and certainly leagues more subtle than the weirdly academic, twelve-tone GameCube start-up exercise.Just as the Mega Sg aims to bring old-school Genesis gameplay to the modern day, Arca takes a less retrospective approach to his task.

"Though Björk’s voice can escalate to a growl on a dime, her default decibel is a breathy staccato, the nervous whisper of a church mouse. Even when speaking, her voice often pendulates into a quiet, sing-songy rhythm, like that of a mythic creature gently casting a spell over you. Fittingly, it is with a rhyme that she first appears in Nietzchka Keene’s , the medieval fantasy that marked her film debut. Björk’s presence is immediately spellbinding, fueled by a cherubic yet witchy energy that runs strong within her still. The film was shot in Iceland in 1986, when she was just 21, but it didn’t premiere until Sundance in 1990. This week, an extensive restoration of  begins a theatrical run at New York’s Metrograph, before expanding to select cities nationwide. is a feminist flip on the Brothers Grimm fairytale of the same name, which originally featured a brutal stepmother. In Keene’s vision, the stepmother, Katla (played by Bryndis Petra Bragadóttir), is less an unforgiving matriarch and more of a survivor. She’s the older of two sisters who are left to fend for themselves after their mother is stoned and burned to death for witchcraft; Björk plays the younger sister, a clairvoyant named Margit. Katla comes up with a plan to keep her and Margit safe: she casts a love spell on a recently widowed man named Jóhann (Valdimar Örn Flygenring), who quickly takes her in as his new wife. Unlike the typical fairytale portrayals of witches, Katla is shown using sorcery as a means to find safety in a world that misunderstands and punishes her kind. In a supernatural story, she’s the anchor that brings stark realism and the terrestrial concerns of womankind.Margit, on the other hand, takes after Björk in the sense that she brings an otherworldly quality wherever she goes. In the film, her dark-abyss eyes often squint to the distance, frequently on the verge of tears, as if shaken to her core by an outside force—eyes that see something beyond the craggy expanse. That’s because Margit is the only one with visions of her dead mother. This connection ends up bonding her to Jóhann’s young son, Jónas (Geirlaug Sunna Þormar), who’s struggling with his own mother’s death and scheming to dismantle Katla’s place in their household. For a brief moment, thanks to Margit, there’s hope of a shift in the tense familial dynamic.Margit (Björk) worries when she realizes she has the gift of visions, for which her mother was stoned and burned. Clip courtesy of Arbelos Films.As an actress, Björk is better known for her role in Lars Von Trier’s , the 2000 film that nabbed her the Best Actress award at Cannes and birthed the infamous swan dress at the Oscars. Though that film also taps into her whimsical side (and utilizes her singing more), her childlike mysticism in  is mesmerizing in a different way. Clothed in humble medieval garb, she is one with the earth, yet she must wrestle with her apocalyptic visions of events to come. In the film’s most memorable scene, her mother opens up her chest to reveal a black hole, through which Margit puts her hand. The meaning of this is unclear, but Margit’s visions turn toward ominous symbols just as the narrative takes a dark turn.Keene was an American filmmaker who studied the Icelandic language. She captured the hills and caves of this fantastical setting on black-and-white, 35mm film to make it feel of a different time and place. Though this Grimm adaptation is rather, well, grim—it contains many sedate stretches and the resolution is no happily ever after—the subtle subversion on the story makes it a worthy watch, and not least for Björk’s presence as the affectional center of a stone-cold world.Björk on set, photos courtesy of Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater.It’s also interesting to consider  in the context of Björk’s future visuals; a warped fairytale aesthetic has been one running theme in her brilliant and vast collection of music videos. You see it most notably in Michel Gondry’s clip for “Human Behaviour,” a surreal reimagination of the Goldilocks story in which Björk’s anti-heroine soars over trees and is pursued by stuffed animals. Even in her more down-to-earth videos like “Venus as a Boy,” where she spends the entire time cooking eggs, Björk’s quaint isolation and fondness for animals (here, an iguana) is vaguely reminiscent of a princess tucked away in a cottage, pining over the pleasures of her feminine prince in this update. And in what is arguably her visual masterwork, “Black Lake,” she hones her supernatural powers amid the famous landscape of her home country, one of her most constant inspirations. The Björk in “Black Lake” could very well be Margit 30 years later, resurrected with a vengeance.",articles4,"['Björk', 'In Keene', 'Björk', 'Margit', 'Margit', 'Björk', 'Katla’s', 'Björk', 'Cannes', 'Margit’s', 'Björk', 'Björk', 'Björk', 'Goldilocks', 'Björk', 'Björk’s', 'The Björk']"

"The music of Adam McIlwee is an acquired taste. Both as the frontman of the emo band Tigers Jaw and as the rapper/singer Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, his voice sounds galaxies away from what might traditionally be considered “good.” He sounds instead like a demented bird, or someone making fun of music. But he is deadly serious. It’s that unshakeable earnestness that allows him to rise above the constraints of his natural talents. If his music is not dead on impact when it reaches your ears, it will eventually travel down to your soul and stay there.I was a slow convert to Wicca’s cause, at first accepting the popular wisdom that he sucked. But after seeing him live with Lil Peep two years ago and feeling the immense passion of his fans firsthand, I was forced to reconsider. Some months ago, following his signing to the popular emo label Run for Cover, I sent a note to his publicist asking to hear any new music he was working on. The label sent over an early copy of his album , which has since been released. Wicca produced the album himself, and not relying on outside artists to shape his sound allowed him to bend the music to his will, not the other way around. Acoustic guitars, signifiers of his past in traditional emo, were splashed across the album alongside staccato trap beats. He’d clearly worked on his voice as well, and while he still sounded odd, he seemed newly confident in that weirdness. “I am in pain and I keep it a secret,” he sings on the bluntly titled “I Need Help.” He’s so severely off-key, you just know he means it. The final effect is something like a slurry Woody Guthrie trying out new rhythms. I loved it.My coworkers, though, weren’t exactly fans of the music. When it seemed clear we wouldn’t do the profile his publicist was hoping for, I quickly sent an email explaining why: “Hey just wanna be straight up with you, I am definitely the only person here that is into the music. I realy [sic] really like it but hard to get stuff to happen when that's the case...reeption [sic] has not been great. Will let you know if that changes (ive been trying!) but at the moment not sure what im gonna be able to do.” The publicist responded that it was “totally fine” and invited me to Wicca’s upcoming concert.Several weeks later, I was scrolling through Instagram and spotted a few lines of text on Wicca’s account. Looking closer, I saw it was a screenshot of the email I’d written to his publicist, reproduced verbatim (: my misspelling of the first “really” was intact but the missing “c” in “reception” had been added). The note was preceded by a preamble from the publicist saying, “Touched base with [] at [] Pitchfork today. See his response below.” There was a second image in the post. I slid right to see it. It was a white sweatshirt with the text of the email printed on the front. He was selling a limited run for $50 each. The caption said “suffer on…”

          This is, weirdly, not the first time a rapper has used my emails about not covering their music as part of their marketing. Seven or eight years ago, when I was an editor at , Machine Gun Kelly’s manager used to write me frequently looking for coverage. Despite his vast fanbase, the Cleveland rapper’s calculated rebel persona wasn’t something I felt was a fit our publication. One day, his manager sent me a link to a video Kelly had made for another publication. In it, he freestyled while someone pounded out a beat with their fists. Overwhelmed at the music’s uselessness and the manager’s continued insistence on not taking a hint, I finally wrote back that I could not foresee a time when Machine Gun Kelly would be covered in . I spelled foresee wrong. I only remember this years-old typo because Kelly put a copy of the email in his music video, and went on Twitter to tell his fans to send me hate mail. The amount of them who chose to make fun of my misspelling was surprising. The amount of them who promised to do gross stuff to my dead body was less surprising.The Wicca sweatshirt incident was different, though. He didn’t use my name, and many in the comments assumed it was another Pitchfork writer. The email I sent was largely positive and sincere while still honoring the tastes of the staff. Seeing that used against me hurt, like I was being punished for being honest.Machine Gun Kelly and Wicca Phase Springs Eternal’s outsized reactions point to their own kind of hurt. After releasing the video, Kelly would tell interviewers that he had been “banned” from , which was not true. Being banned is not the same as not being invited. But he tried to turn a rejection into something he could own, becoming an outlaw with loud and public disdain for the thing he once aggressively courted. It made sense. It’s not an excuse for why he told thousands of people to send me unfathomably vile emails, but it is a reason.I’m still annoyed at Machine Gun Kelly, but with Wicca, the dazed feeling of seeing my own private note aired out has eroded since that initial shock two months ago. He at least responded with ingenuity, not malice. So eventually, like the fan I remain, I paid my $50 and bought the sweatshirt.",articles4,"['Tigers Jaw', 'Wicca Phase Springs Eternal', 'Wicca’s', 'Lil Peep', 'Seven', 'Machine Gun Kelly’s', 'Machine Gun Kelly', 'Machine Gun Kelly', 'Machine Gun Kelly', 'Wicca']"

Last week, on March 8, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony charges for allegedly filing false police reports claiming he was a victim of a hate crime attack in Chicago. Smollett’s lawyer Mark Geragos called the indictment “prosecutorial overkill” in a statement.Smollett initially claimed that he was the victim of a hate crime on January 29, telling police that two men had accosted him, beat him, called him homophobic and racist slurs, put a rope around his neck, and poured bleach on him before running away. On February 13, brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo were taken into custody and questioned in relation to the alleged attack. After police spoke with the Osundairos and inconsistencies arose in Smollett’s testimony, the actor was deemed a suspect in a separate case investigating his claims.Smollet turned himself into authorities on February 21 and was released on bond later that day. Following the charges, “Empire” producers (including Lee Daniels) issued a statement announcing that Smollett would be cut from the final two episodes of the show’s next season in order to “avoid further disruption on set.”",articles4,"['Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Abimbola Osundairo', 'Smollet', 'Smollett']"

"In the premiere of “Broad City’s” fifth and final season, Ilana documents her bestie Abbi’s 30th birthday through a series of thirsty (but horizontal) Instagram stories. Before they spend the day walking from the tippity top of Manhattan to the very bottom, chronicling bathroom breaks and manhole accidents along the way, Ilana (played by Ilana Glazer) captures a four-second teaser of Abbi (Abbi Jacobson) dancing around with her backpack, set to Bored Lord’s “Crush on U.” Before you know it, the jagged dance track drops out and the troublesome twosome are well on their way to a misadventure.Hearing a song on “Broad City” is often like this, as though you’re catching a glimpse of a killer track in the background of your cool friend’s Instagram story. Those few seconds are too obscure to recognize, too fleeting to Shazam, yet too good a bop to let go, often leading to that “hey, what’re you listening to?” DM. Music is commonly cued through the passing drop of a beat, a clap, a decorative filler for the already chaotic energy of Abbi and Ilana—songs essentially asking to be followed, not unlike the man they  they witnessed murdering his girlfriend last season.Music supervisor Matt FX Feldman, who started his career as a teen, picking songs for the short-lived American reboot of “Skins,” has made the chase easier with well-maintained Spotify and Apple Music playlists. A quick scroll through the eclectic playlist might make you feel not very in the know. Feldman finds many of the unsigned artists featured on the show through Facebook or Twitter, rather than relying on more traditional licensing channels.Feldman’s vision for the show, developed with show creators Glazer and Jacobson, spans the tongue-rolling raps of Yung Skrrt to the funky disco of Midnight Magic. Some of this season’s better finds include the honey-dipped “i’ma get you” from rising R&B singer duendita, the tropical yet lovelorn “Tiny Umbrella” from L.A.’s Coast Modern, and the raw, riff-fueled sound of Death Valley Girls’ “Disaster (Is What We’re After).” Occasionally the needle drops can feel a little on the nose, like Aussie singer-songwriter Jen Cloher’s “Strong Woman” opening this season’s fifth episode, all about female entrepreneurship. These syncs are never loud enough to be in your face, though, and they never sink down to the shrink-wrapped uniformity of, say, the music you would hear at Anthropologie, Abbi’s workplace.The soundtrack’s grab-bag vibe often echoes an aesthetic established in the show’s 2014 pilot: This is the kind of music you would hear at a Brooklyn rooftop party you just stumbled into, after one too many wrong turns. That the show puts a focus on up-and-coming New York artists—from Junglepussy to Richie Quake—is also notable. More than anything, though, the low-budget music approach of “Broad City” mirrors the show’s central conflict: the millennial hustle.Sure, there is the occasional comedic gag set to a beloved (read: expensive) hit, from Abbi streaking across her apartment to Lady Gaga’s “Edge of Glory” or channeling Missy Elliott in “The Rain” video as Drake’s “Started From the Bottom” blares. But that latter scene, in which Abbi deposits “8,000 fucking dollars” into her bank account, is the rare moment of affluence for the scrappy duo. For all its ridiculous plotlines and borderline homoerotic odes to female friendship, “Broad City” has always been most poignant about its generation’s economic anxieties. The pilot centers on the girls scraping together enough money to buy Lil Wayne tickets, and this new season has doubled down on the job insecurity of current twenty- and thirty-somethings. We’ve seen Abbi juggle her artistic ambitions with her 9-to-5 (she gets fired for decorating the Anthropologie window display after hours) and take on a second credit card (only to have her information stolen immediately, of course), while Ilana creates her own DIY “SheWork,” the feminist, smoker-friendly answer to WeWork. Their narrow career prospects, in an unforgivingly expensive city, have begun to weigh on them.Perhaps that’s why the most memorable music moment this season involves Ka5sh’s “Lifestyle” soundtracking Lincoln (Hannibal Buress) and Ilana’s annual anniversary feast. This is a meal that is both unusually gaudy (for them) and massively diarrhea-inducing (for just about anyone). The song serves as a deafening ring while the reunited pair stuff their faces in both ecstasy and agony. At the same time, Abbi class-travels between a server gig and coveted guest spot at a fancy art-world event, like Mrs. Doubtfire at the MoMA.What’s great about this choice, frankly, is that it’s  an overplayed (and honestly, unaffordable) Jay-Z track. It’s a song that comments on rap’s frequent wealth-flaunting, courtesy of a young rapper who started out slinging memes just to make ends meet. That right there is the “Broad City” work ethic come to life.",articles4,"['Bored Lord', 'Death Valley Girls’', 'Aussie', 'Jen Cloher’s', 'Abbi’s', 'Richie Quake', 'Sure', 'Missy Elliott', 'Lil Wayne', 'Ka5sh’s', 'Jay-Z']"

"Apple disputes the streaming company’s complaint to European regulatorsSpotify has filed an antitrust complaint against Apple with the European Commission, as CNBC reports. In a blog post, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek cited Apple’s “discriminatory tariffs” when it comes to their proprietary App Store, including a 30 percent “tax” imposed on any upgrades from Spotify’s Free to Premium service for iPhone users. Ek also decried “unfair restrictions on marketing and promotions that benefit consumers” when it came to reaching Spotify customers within the Apple ecosystem.Apple strongly denied the claims in a statement that claims “Spotify’s aim is to make more money off others’ work. And it’s not just the App Store that they’re trying to squeeze—it’s also artists, musicians and songwriters.” Apple then cites Spotify’s recent appeal against a decision in the U.S. to raise royalty rates, claiming their case “represents a real, meaningful and damaging step backwards for the music industry.”Ek said in his original statement, “We aren’t seeking special treatment. We simply want the same treatment as numerous other apps on the App Store, like Uber or Deliveroo, who aren’t subject to the Apple tax and therefore don’t have the same restrictions. So, let me be clear that this is not a Spotify-versus-Apple issue. We want the same fair rules for companies young and old, large and small.” Apple says Spotify is subjected to the same restrictions as all other similar apps.Apple have been accused of antitrust action in the past. In November 2018, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the long-running case Apple v. Pepper, in which a group of iPhone owners accused the company of monopolizing the market for iPhone apps, claiming the 30 percent commission is a monopoly rent. The ruling on that case is still pending.",articles4,"['Premium', 'iPhone', 'Spotify', 'Uber', 'Spotify', 'iPhone', 'iPhone']"

"Goldenvoice were sued by Oregon concert promoter in 2018, who claimed anti-trust damagesIn April 2018, Coachella organizers Goldenvoice were hit with a lawsuit that alleged the restrictive radius clause for the festival was in violation of anti-trust law. Oregon-based promoter Soul’d Out Productions claimed that the Coachella contract—which legally forbids artists from playing any other North American festival from December 15 to May 1—hurt their annual Soul’d Out Music Festival. Now, the presiding judge in the case has permanently dismissed the lawsuit, as Billboard reports.In the original lawsuit, Soul’d Out organizers claimed that artists including SZA and Daniel Caesar have had to turn down their festival due to the clause. In a rebuttal, Coachella organizers said they would “vigorously defend against this lawsuit, which calls into question a long-standing industry practice that is crucial to our ability to continue offering fans the unrivaled experience for which Coachella has become known.” In October 2018, U.S. District Court Judge Michael Mosman dismissed the lawsuit but allowed for the claims to be refiled with technical tweaks.

"One side gave birth to headlines that were literally untrue. The other side was accused of engaging in “fake news.” All this for a 119-page, footnote-packed ruling by a little-known panel of federal judges? Welcome to the no-holds-barred legal battle currently pitting trade groups for songwriters and music publishers against the major streaming services.The drama heated up in January 2018, when the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board decided to boost the royalty rate that Spotify, Apple Music, and similar streamers must pay songwriters and publishers. Flash forward to last week, when Spotify, Google, Pandora, and Amazon revealed they were each planning to appeal that ruling. The National Music Publishers Association (NMPA) blasted the move, claiming that Spotify and Amazon had chosen to “sue songwriters.” Perhaps fueled by this incendiary wording—which a NMPA spokesperson tells Pitchfork is “shorthand for the technical legal process of them appealing”—backlash against the streaming services quickly spread among songwriters and industry figures. This week, Spotify responded to the criticism with a blog post noting the complexity of the situation.Music publishing companies, meanwhile, maintain that the situation is quite simple: The CRB raised songwriters’ pay, and Spotify opposes it. But the legal ruling itself—stuffed with such pithy phrases as, “Several direct licenses between [REDACTED] and music publishers base royalties on a straight, uncapped 70 percentage of TCC, with no ‘greater-of’ prong”—certainly  pretty complicated. We put together a non-legalese rundown of what’s happening in Big Tech’s battle with songwriters and publishers.The CRB is a panel of three federal judges appointed by the Library of Congress. Under U.S. law, these judges meet regularly to set the rates for mechanical royalties, the type paid to songwriters and their publishers when their songs are sold or streamed. In a 2017 legal proceeding, the CRB heard the Nashville Songwriters Association International and the NMPA make a joint case against Apple, Spotify, Amazon, Pandora, and Google. Though one judge dissented, the CRB ultimately reached its decision to raise rates, over a five-year period, from 10.5 percent to 15.1 percent—reportedly the biggest single increase the CRB has made since it was created by Congress in the mid-2000s. “In this market, with the evidence before them, the Judges have attempted to establish royalty rates and terms that compensate songwriters and music publishers and offer to licensees appropriate returns and incentives for continued development,” Judges Suzanne Barnett and Jesse Feder wrote.Spotify, Google, Pandora, and Amazon have all signaled their plans to appeal. The first three companies said in a joint statement that the CRB increased royalty rates “in a manner that raises serious procedural and substantive concerns.” If left intact, they claimed, the decision would hurt both streaming services and songwriters.Apple is not taking part in the appeals. As such, the NMPA and other industry figures were quick to praise Apple as pro-artist. That said, if the appeals succeed, Apple could conceivably have its cake and eat it too, enjoying the benefit of lower rates without the ire of coming out in favor of them. Apple’s vast phone business and huge cash reserves also mean it’s more insulated from higher costs of doing business than Spotify would be.“Instead of accepting the CRB’s decision, which still values songs less than their fair market value, Spotify and Amazon have declared war on the songwriting community by appealing that decision,” NMPA head David Israelite said in a statement. “No amount of insincere and hollow public relations gestures such as throwing parties or buying billboards of congratulations or naming songwriters ‘geniuses’ can hide the fact that these big tech bullies do not respect or value the songwriters who make their businesses possible.” Bart Herbison of the NSIA added, “You cannot feed a family when you earn hundreds of dollars for millions of streams.”Individual songwriters also reacted with outrage. “This is WRONG,” wrote Amber Coffman, the singer-songwriter and former Dirty Projectors member. Pop hitmaker Justin Tranter wrote that without “songs these tech companies have nothing to stream/sell. Shameful.” “Spotify please do what’s right and drop your appeal,” wrote hip-hop producer and songwriter Frank Dukes.Spotify in essence claims that all sides want more money for songwriters—they just disagree on how to get there. “The CRB rate structure is complex and there were significant flaws in how it was set,” the company said in its blog post. “A key area of focus in our appeal will be the fact that the CRB’s decision makes it very difficult for music services to offer ‘bundles’ of music and non-music offerings. This will hurt consumers who will lose access to them. These bundles are key to attracting first-time music subscribers so we can keep growing the revenue pie for everyone.” (Spotify didn’t elaborate on what it meant by bundles, but just today it announced a discounted streaming bundle that offers free Hulu with a Spotify Premium subscription.)Spotify also must negotiate a separate set of royalty rates with record labels, another consideration implied in its blog post: “The CRB judges set the new publishing rates by assuming that record labels would react by reducing their licensing rates, but their assumption is incorrect.”“On some level this is expected,” the artists’ advocacy nonprofit Future of Music Coalition noted. “The CRB process by which rates are decided has an inherently adversarial dynamic. At the same time, many listeners and artists don’t know that some services routinely, quietly lobby to pay artists less.”The CRB fight comes on the heels of a sweeping new music copyright law, the Music Modernization Act—a rare instance when all sides of the music business found a way to cooperate. Maybe there’s a way for Big Tech and shoestring tunesmiths to reconcile their differences in this case, too. “The issue is so complex because both sides are right: songwriters need to be paid more, and streaming services need to increase [profit] margin,” writes Mark Mulligan, the managing director of boutique media and technology analysis firm MIDiA Research. His recommendation: Raise streaming prices.Netflix, Mulligan notes, has always managed to raise its prices to stay ahead of inflation. Spotify hasn’t. It can’t, and its rivals can’t, because they don’t have Netflix-like exclusive content—listeners could just flock toward the cheapest streaming service. And yet Spotify, the streaming service with the most paid subscribers in an incredibly competitive space, still has only once turned a quarterly operating profit. The music streaming business hasn’t yet found a way to consistently land in the black. Charging more than $10/month for a streaming subscription could certainly help, assuming the rest of the music industry is open to the idea. If listeners actually want songwriters to get paid more, they need to be part of the solution.",articles4,"['Spotify', 'The CRB', 'Apple’s', 'Amber Coffman', 'Dirty Projectors']"

Is the lighting in this apartment so bad? Never do we consider how the software feels. Holly Herndon’s video for her dizzying new song “Eternal” follows the lonely journey of a machine as it analyzes and connects to a human face. It’s blurry and disorienting: a collage of eyes, ears, and mouths materializing in front of the camera, soundtracked by one of the most direct melodies Herndon has ever composed. Synth-orchestra blasts beam in from Y2K pop radio. A dance rhythm keeps stalling out while it’s buffering. “Right in front of my eyes,” a choir sings, slowly, in unison.Herndon’s process involves filtering human experiences through a maze of modern technology. For her new music, she developed an A.I. program called “Spawn” through which she feeds samples of her own vocals to retrieve alien renderings of herself. In her previous single, “Godmother,” a collaboration with Jlin, the result was abstract and alien—a spiral of buzzing gnats and gasping breaths that, in the video, culminated in both artists bursting into laughter.

"The band sued the fashion brand for copyright infringement for using a similar logo on its “Redux Grunge Collection”In December 2018, Nirvana, L.L.C. filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Marc Jacobs International L.L.C. and others. In the suit, attorneys for Nirvana alleged that Marc Jacobs used the band’s imagery, particularly its “Happy Face” logo, without authorization for the brand’s “Redux Grunge Collection.” Lawyers for Marc Jacobs have now filed a motion for dismissal, The Blast reports and Pitchfork can confirm.In Marc Jacobs’ motion for dismissal, filed last Friday, March 8 in a California federal court and viewed by Pitchfork, the company’s lawyers argue that Nirvana, L.L.C. is not the legitimate owner of the “Happy Face” logo copyright registration, that the registration is invalid, and that the fashion brand did not copy copyrightable aspects of the logo.Regarding the first point, Marc Jacobs’ lawyers claim that Kurt Cobain was the creator of the logo and that it remains unclear how he may have transferred the copyright ownership to Nirvana, L.L.C. (which includes Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic). The lawyers’ second claim concerns the different dates and aspects of Nirvana’s original copyright claims, resulting in discrepancies that they believe make the claims invalid.Thirdly, attorneys for Marc Jacobs argue that the copyright infringement suit should be dismissed because “there is no extrinsic similarity” between the copyrighted art and what Marc Jacobs used on its clothing. Based on their interpretation of Nirvana’s original copyright filings, referred to as “the ’166 Registration,” the attorneys argue:The ’166 Registration includes the word “Nirvana.” The Accused
Products do not. The ’166 Registration includes the Flower Sniffin
Writing. The Accused Products do not. The ‘166 Registration includes a
smiley face with Xs as eyes. The Accused Products do not; they use a
different letter for each eye, the letters M and J, signifying Marc
Jacobs. The only similarity between what is covered by the ’166
Registration and the artwork contained on the Accused Products that
can be gleaned from the Complaint is the use of a substantially
circular outline for the smiley face and a squiggly line used for a
mouth, with a tongue sticking out.In the original complaint, lawyers for Nirvana, L.L.C. state that Marc Jacobs’ “use of copyrighted image on and to promote its product is intentional, and is part and parcel of a wider campaign associate the entire ‘Bootleg Redux Grunge’ collection with Nirvana, one of the founders of the ‘Grunge’ musical genre, so as to make the ‘Grunge’ association with the collection more authentic.”In their motion for dismissal, lawyers for Marc Jacobs note:The release of the Redux Grunge Collection was met with much fanfare
in the fashion press, and fashion insiders rushed to buy the coveted
looks that had not been available for 25 years. As friends of the
brand, Ms. [Courtney]
Love and Ms.
[Frances Bean] Cobain helped celebrate the release of the collection.
Each woman was gifted designs from the collection. Ms. Love was
invited to perform at the launch event for the collection in Los
Angeles. Both Ms. Love and Ms. Cobain “liked” and commented on the
images of the collection that Mr. Jacobs posted on his Instagram feed,
including, notably, images of Mr. Jacobs in the t-shirt that is one of
the Accused Products. Ms. Love commented on one of the images of Mr.
Jacobs in that shirt, saying, “Nice photo! Looks some  what
familiar! Amazing!”In addition to Marc Jacobs, Nirvana, L.L.C.’s lawsuit named Saks Incorporated and Neiman Marcus Group Limited, L.L.C. as defendants for selling the allegedly infringing items. The suit asks for monetary damages, the stop of sale of any of the allegedly infringing items, as well as the removal of any Nirvana references from Jacobs’ promotional materials.Representatives for Nirvana offered Pitchfork no comment.",articles4,"['Nirvana', 'Nirvana', 'Marc Jacobs', 'Nirvana', 'Marc Jacobs’', 'Nirvana', 'Nirvana', 'Marc Jacobs', 'Marc Jacobs', 'Nirvana', 'Nirvana', 'The Accused Products', 'Marc\nJacobs', '’166', 'Nirvana', 'Nirvana', 'Marc Jacobs', 'Mr. Jacobs', 'Accused Products', 'Ms. Love', 'Nirvana', 'Nirvana', 'Nirvana']"
"After growing up in Brooklyn, singer and producer Grace Ives bounced around East Coast colleges before landing at SUNY Purchase, where her Roland MC 505 groovebox distinguished her from the plethora of guitarists hoping to follow the path of alumna Mitski. Along the way, Ives accumulated a fanbase who regularly attend her DIY gigs around the city, to which she lugs a blue IKEA bag full of equipment. Ives is now back in New York in a Queens apartment where she wrote her latest single, “Mirror.” This closing track to her upcoming full-length, , is a clinic in spartan bedroom-pop. Ives’ buttery vocals illustrate a simple realization (“I think I finally got it figured out”) as if a “mirror on the wall” has presented a long-awaited answer.

"Solange is never bound to one single method of expression. That’s why, after releasing her new album  on March 1st, she put out the record’s self-directed companion film later that same day. Shot largely in Texas, the 33-minute clip builds on the album’s vision of Houston as a space boundless in black spirituality. Solange practices mudras inside of the city’s famed Rothko Chapel. Images of black cowboys are juxtaposed with ancient Egyptian iconography. And in one segment set to “Dreams,” a woman stands on her lawn watching the family across the street cycle through various stages of life—sometimes playing, sometimes mourning. Eventually the woman turns into a shrub with a festering human hand.That surreal scene was written and directed by Terence Nance, the Dallas-born, Brooklyn-based auteur behind HBO’s “Random Acts of Flyness,” a sketch comedy show that explores black American identities through a dark, Dadaist lens. Most recently, Nance was tapped by LeBron James and ’s Ryan Coogler to direct the long-awaited  sequel. And besides directing videos for artists like Solange, Earl Sweatshirt, and Nick Hakim, Nance is also a musician in his own right.Solange and Nance first met after being cast by Barry Jenkins to star in an Afrofuturist film called , where they would play a husband and wife duo sent back to 1972 via a time-travel device powered by Stevie Wonder jams. Although  was intended as the follow-up to Jenkins’ 2008 debut feature , the film got scrapped—but could still happen, according to Nance. Solange and Nance stayed in touch, and last summer the two found themselves both gravitating toward similar aspects of Eastern religion. After Nance asked Solange to contribute music to “Random Acts of Flyness,” she played a stripped down jazz set in the season one finale, notably singing the word “onyx” over and over again. Along the way, Solange sent Nance snippets of what would become Calling from Los Angeles, where he’s working on pre-production for , Nance spoke with Pitchfork about Solange’s “superpowers” and so much more.Terence Nance: We were doing musical elements for the show and I reached out to her to see if she wanted to do something. She sent me some songs—I would call them more like meditations—that really related to what I was thinking about terms of repetition. Like, mantras that you design for yourself, that signal to dogma that are self-created and individual. Around the time we were talking about that, she started playing me what she was working on. I think it was related to some of what she had [composed for the show]. I was taken aback and surprised, in a great way, with where she was going. And she was like, “You want to work on this film?” I’m from Dallas and for a little bit had lived in Houston’s Third Ward [where Solange grew up], so we have a lot of the same reference points—that same familiarity.https://twitter.com/ammmye/status/1038183932095856648I didn’t have one song in my purview when I was writing. Solange and I had conversations about violence, [posing questions] like, “Is violence always bad? Is there violence that is justified in the service of protection—and protecting who, protecting what? What are like the remnants of violence on a body that would feel like armor, feel like something you could you be proud of, but also would not want to be there?” Because “Things I Imagined” and “Dreams” were in my head at the same time, I was thinking of it more like a younger child’s perspective. And Solange was like, “Nah, I kind of thought of this as more like an adult thing.” It came out as a larger conversation about what the whole [film] could be.I was looking at places, but nothing was giving me that feeling of familiarity. So I asked the [location scouts] to find the place where I used to live. It was crazy, because that house was for sale, and I thought maybe we could we could shoot there. But it was better to shoot around the corner, because we had to find two houses across the street from each other that were both cool with it.I think that part of Solange’s superpower is activating space, seeing it differently than you get to see it. A whole part of the film [set to “Down with the Clique”] was shot in front of Dallas City Hall. That's the place that I saw so much growing up. It’s a huge building that has a really dramatic 45 degree angle like it’s going to fall on you—this sort of intentional feeling of, it has power over you because it’s City Hall. But in the way that she activates it, she changes it a little bit. It’s nighttime, she’s in all black, and there are a lot of people in all black. It made [the building] feel more in service of her and us. If you look at her set design and what she’s doing as a sculptor, it’s definitely about sacredness and space-making for black people and black women.It helps because I know what it’s like to churn out a song from your innards. [] In my experience, [music] is more intimate—more singular than a film, which is impossible to make alone. It’s more of a minefield emotionally when other people are brought into the process, especially with anything that represents the music, like a video.I didn’t grow up thinking like “I’m this” or “I’m that” [in terms of creativity]. I was introduced to that idea when I got into a school environment that was trying to train me to make money. I went to art school, which is like a person in a room talking shit. So I learned how to talk shit.The first jobs I had in film were making music for TV shows, opening theme songs and bumpers. Then I’d compose music for my friends’ short films. Then I would design posters and obviously, I was editing and animating and doing all that stuff. But I didn’t have a business card that said all those things. I was just like, trying to survive.",articles4,"['Solange', 'Nance', 'Solange', 'Nick Hakim', 'Nance', 'Solange', 'Nance', 'Stevie Wonder', 'Nance', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Nance', 'Nance', 'Pitchfork', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange’s']"

"Listen to the track belowOn “Better,” the title track from the Philadelphia band Caracara’s forthcoming EP recorded under the tutelage of modern-day super-producer Will Yip, William Lindsay is losing his years in the perpetual closing-time of late-capitalism, wondering if those bad ol’ days of the late ’90s are as good as it’ll ever get. “You’ll be missed when you’re gone, if you ever leave at all,” Lindsay moans as part of a continuous litany of “pent up lusts and housing busts,” reminiscing on his wasted nights with “Bathsheba of the strip mall set” and the lingering effects on the heroin-pushing K&A Gang on the Fishtown neighborhood of Philly. At least in its first half, “Better” is a more polished take on the bummer jams of 2017’s harshly produced Summer Megalith, but at some point, Yip must’ve reminded Caracara about his early days working with arena-level bands like the Fray and Keane. Ditching any pretense of indie modesty, “Better” lifts off in its second half, evoking quintessential semi-emo power ballads “How’s It Going to Be” and “Fix You” and leaving the words of Lindsay and Mannequin Pussy’s Marisa Dabice obscured in afterburner exhaust.

"He was taken into police custody on March 6 over the unpaid feesR. Kelly has been granted release from jail today (March 9) after paying over $160,000 in back child support fees, the Chicago Tribune reports and representatives for the Cook County Sheriff’s Office confirmed to Pitchfork.Earlier today,  reporter Megan Crepeau confirmed in a tweet that Kelly had paid six figures in back child support and would be released within the following hour or so. A Cook County Sheriff’s Office representative later confirmed to Pitchfork that the civil contempt purge had been paid and that Kelly is no longer in police custody. According to the , who spoke with chief policy officer Cara Smith at Cook County Sheriff’s Office, a check for the full amount of Kelly’s back child support had been handed over to the Circuit Court Clerk’s office. However, a copy of the bond slip did not show who posted the $161,663 owed by Kelly. Smith reportedly said that the individual wished to remain anonymous. Kelly’s next court date is March 13.https://twitter.com/crepeau/status/1104434372084727808Kelly was taken into custody by the Cook County Sheriff’s Office on March 6 during a hearing over his unpaid child support. Kelly reportedly owed over $200,000 in back child support to his ex-wife Andrea Kelly, and was told he would face jail time if he failed to pay $161,633 of that amount.On February 22, Kelly turned himself in to authorities in Chicago after being charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. On February 25, Kelly was released from jail on $100,000 bail—10 percent of the $1 million bond set by the judge. Kelly pled not guilty to all 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, which stem from charges involving four women (three of whom were underage) who prosecutors say Kelly abused during the period of 1998 to 2010.Earlier this week, Kelly appeared on “CBS This Morning,” where he spoke with Gayle King. The appearance marked Kelly’s first interview since being arrested on charges of sexual abuse.

"This week, “CBS This Morning” aired a two-part interview with R. Kelly—the first he’s given since “Surviving R. Kelly” brought a wider consciousness to his alleged pattern of disturbing abuse over the years. More of the singer’s conversation with Gayle King will air as a primetime special today (March 8), but the clips that have premiered thus far show Kelly pulling out all the stops to assert his innocence. (Kelly currently faces charges on 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in Cook County, Illinois.) Quickly turning from nonchalant to anguished to enraged, Kelly’s behavior includes certain denial and manipulation tactics commonly employed by abusers, according to experts in the field.From relativizing the claims to minimizing the accusers and their supporters, Kelly repeatedly distorts reality by negotiating around the accusations rather than directly engaging with them. Kelly’s outsized reactions to King’s reasonable questions are indicative of larger diversion patterns employed by abusers, experts say. “When you’re a clinician, you can’t watch this stuff without your brain flying in 15 different directions,” says Maria-Anne Duncan, a licensed clinical social worker who has counseled sexual assault survivors and abusers alike. “I couldn’t see him as R. Kelly, all I could see is the perpetrator who is now trying to state his case, and wasn’t stating it very well, in my opinion.” Adds Dr. Patrick Preston, a psychologist who works with sexual assault survivors, “The whole interview got turned into the story of his perceived victimhood and his right in the world.”At the top of the interview, Kelly says he agreed to speak to King because he is “tired of all the lies.” When asked to state exactly what those lies are, Kelly mischaracterizes the allegations by focusing on the more outlandish claims, rather than the actual behaviors behind them—a classic diversion tactic. “I have a harem, a whatcha call it, a cult,” he says, a small smile cracking on his face. “I don’t even really know what a cult is but I know I don’t have one.”Kelly also claims that his 2008 trial for 14 counts of child pornography, for which he was acquitted because the jury could not confirm the girl's identity, has influenced what people think of the current accusations, which he finds unfair and irrelevant. When King presses him to admit that “the past is relevant with you with underage girls,” Kelly quickly shuts her down. “Absolutely no, it’s not because for one, I beat my case,” he says.Both Dr. Preston and Duncan take pause with Kelly’s repeated focus on how his past acquittal affirms his current innocence. “Most people with basic empathy pause if they’re accused of something,” Dr. Preston says. “But abusers manipulate that as a way of controlling the person they’re abusing. So once they get caught, there’s no flexibility to go outside for some self-reflection. For them [the accusation] just further supports that the world has wronged them because on some level, they believe they have the right to take whatever they want.” Duncan makes a similar point, explaining that when most people are falsely accused of a crime, they do everything they can to stress their innocence. “His comment in the interview was ‘I beat the charge’—and isn’t it interesting that he used the word ‘beat?’” she says. “What he’s saying is, ‘Yeah, I know I did the wrong thing, but I got away with it.’”When King lists the names of some of Kelly’s accusers—Andrea Kelly, Kitti Jones, Lisa Van Allen, Lizette Martinez, Jerhonda Pace, Faith Rogers, Asante McGee—and asks if all these women are lying in the Lifetime documentary series “Surviving R. Kelly,” the singer asserts that they are. Taking on a soft, hushed voice, he says, “You can start a rumor on a guy like me or a celebrity just like that. All you have to do is push a button on your phone and say: ‘So and so did this to me. R. Kelly did this to me.’” If one woman can make money or gain clout from defaming him, he suggests, others will follow, blaming “the power of social media.”From there, Kelly begins to rely on histrionics as a means of gaining sympathy. “I have been assassinated, I have been buried alive,” he says, as tears well in his eyes. Though it may seem obvious, Dr. Preston points out that crying is a common manipulation strategy for accused abusers. “You look at R. Kelly, you look at Bill O’Reilly, you look at Bill Cosby, and you see this similar tactic of making themselves the victim, shaming, blaming, even the crocodile tears. It’s one thing if somebody’s crying because they’re connected to you and they see the pain they’ve inflicted, but it’s a whole different thing if someone is just crying because they feel like they’ve been wronged by the world. There’s often an emotional inflexibility of abusers: They can’t tolerate feelings like sadness and those emotions become outward expressions of anger.” When King later asks Kelly what type of help he needs, he says, “I need somebody to help me not have a big heart.”As Kelly’s emotions rise, he begins to pathologize the people who question him, grappling to note even weak fallacies in their reasoning. He practically gaslights the general public for what he perceives to be their lack of common sense. “How stupid would it be for me, with my crazy past and what I’ve been through—oh, right now I just think I need to be a monster, hold girls against their will, chain them up in my basement, and don’t let them eat, don’t let them out.” Says Duncan, “When I heard the grandiosity, the narcissism of, ‘I’m so important, I don’t need to trick someone into being with me,’ I thought about how much he really wants that public persona of ‘I’m the great R. Kelly, these women came to me.’”Just as Dr. Preston predicted, this defensive tirade spirals until Kelly is lording over King, screaming and weeping like he’s acting out a dramatic scene from “Trapped in the Closet.” “Y’all trying to kill me,” he shrieks. In his anger, Kelly attempts to garner sympathy once again by invoking his children: “This is not about music, I’m trying to have a relationship with my kids.” (After the release of “Surviving R. Kelly,” Buku Abi, the singer’s estranged daughter with Andrea Kelly, called her father “a monster.”)Kelly also attempts to relativize his alleged behavior by contrasting the things he’s been accused of with the problems of “real girls” who have been abducted and raped. “They really do have chains on their wrists and they can’t get out and they end up buried and dead.” “That feels like such a classic minimization and dehumanization of the victims,” Dr. Preston says. “It’s such a tactic of denial, one of my supervisors once called that ‘sleight of hand’ like, ‘Hey, look over here, just don’t look at me.’”When King asks Kelly if the sexual abuse he experienced in his youth has shaped his life, Kelly initially claims that the abuse hasn’t affected him at all. But he then backpedals to say that any struggles he has faced in the past have affected his music,  his behavior. Some experts believe that “most people” who are abusers were abused themselves, King says, but “not all people that have been abused go out and abuse others.” Kelly then proudly claims to be in the “not all” category. While King’s point is meant to help Kelly see that violence can be cyclical, it only gives him another tool to deny his accountability. “To understand that kind of deflection,” Duncan says, “you’ve got to understand that for many, they’ve been part of the pattern of abuse for so long, they believe they’re innocent of it.”In another portion of the conversation, King asks Kelly about his relationship with two women he considers his girlfriends, Joycelyn Savage (21) and Azriel Clary (23). Both have defended the singer publicly, while their parents claim Kelly psychologically manipulated them into an abusive situation. Kelly flips the script by claiming that the women’s parents should take responsibility for introducing their daughters to Kelly in the hopes that he could help their music careers. “What kind of father, what kind of mother, would sell their daughter to a man,” he asks King, adding that Clary’s parents wanted him to have sex with their daughter. “Basically what he’s saying is, ‘They were okay with it, why are you mad at me?’” Duncan explains. This takes some of the heat off him and casts the parents as the villains. King also spoke with Savage and Clary, though despite a previous agreement otherwise, Kelly was present during the women’s joint interview. He looms in the background, at one point threatening to shut things down, while the women also shift blame onto their parents.After the first segment of the interview aired, Gayle King’s on-screen patience with Kelly was met with applause online. But many people, including the members of Color of Change, a racial justice organization that has been critical of Kelly, believe that CBS should be held accountable for providing a platform “to a sexual predator determined to undermine the credibility of his victims before he appears in court.” This point is particularly salient when you consider that the interview has been packaged into a three-day, would-be ratings goldmine by the network. Clips from Wednesday’s “CBS This Morning” episode have garnered almost 3 million plays on Twitter; King, whose contract is up for negotiation this year, is reportedly looking at a huge raise.As Kelly stands above King, screaming, she offers him a moment to collect himself. “I hope this camera keeps going,” Kelly says, as powder is applied to his face. He seems to say, . It’s a performative moment that Duncan, the clinical social worker, hasn’t been able to shake. “His main focus was to look in that camera and try to garner sympathy. There are going to be people out there who think, . People saw the interview—it was on CBS! Is this going to make it very difficult to have a trial? Did he just skew a jury?”",articles4,"['Cook County', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s', 'King’s', 'Kelly’s', 'Kelly’s', 'Andrea Kelly', 'Lisa Van Allen', 'Jerhonda Pace', 'Asante McGee', 'Kelly’s', 'I’m', 'I’m', 'Andrea Kelly', 'Joycelyn Savage', 'Clary’s', 'Savage', 'Clary']"
"The counts stem from Smollett allegedly filing false police reports back in JanuaryFormer “Empire” actor Jussie Smollett has been indicted by a grand jury on 16 felony counts for filing false police reports that he was a victim of a hate crime attack back in January, CBS and NBC report. The “false report of offense” charges Smollett faces are Class 4 felonies. Smollett’s arraignment is scheduled for March 14.In a statement to Pitchfork, Smollett’s attorney Mark Geragos said:“The fact of an indictment was not unexpected. We knew that there is no way they would  expose their evidence to a public airing and subject their witnesses to cross-examination. What is unexpected, however, is the prosecutorial overkill in charging 16 separate counts against Jussie. This redundant and vindictive indictment is nothing more than a desperate attempt to make headlines in order to distract from the internal investigation launched to investigate the outrageous leaking of false information by the Chicago Police Department and the shameless and illegal  invasion of Jussie’s privacy in tampering with his medical records.  Jussie adamantly maintains his innocence even if law enforcement has robbed him of that presumption.”On January 29, it was reported that Smollett had been attacked in Chicago by two men in what appeared to be a hate crime. Smollett received an outpouring of support from the public after the alleged incident. The following month, two men (identified as brothers Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo) were arrested and questioned by police in connection with the alleged attack. Smollett was categorized as a suspect in the case after the men were released from police custody without criminal charges on February 15. Later that month, Smollett was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct.The grand jury has now returned the disorderly conduct charges and expanded the charges against Smollet, indicting him on 16 felonies. According to CBS, the indictment states: “Jussie Smollett knew that at the time… there was no reasonable ground for believing that such offenses had been committed.” Smollett allegedly made false statements to two different Chicago Police officers.Pitchfork has reached out to the Chicago Police Department for further comment.",articles4,"['Smollett', 'Jussie Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Police Department', 'Jussie’s', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Abimbola Osundairo', 'Smollett', 'Smollett', 'Smollet', 'Smollett']"

"Listen to the track belowIt took the Black Keys nine years to become one of the biggest rock bands in America, an honor that is at once shockingly difficult yet nearly bereft of any real competition. Their five-year reign kicked off with one of their best albums, 2010’s , but by the end they were just aping their own knockoffs, not sounding so different from those Pizza Hut and Home Depot ads. There was a glimmer of relief at the end of 2014’s , though: Closing track “Gotta Get Away” was a loose-limbed ditty whose advice the duo seemed to take. Guitarist and singer Dan Auerbach and drummer Patrick Carney threw themselves into more interesting side projects and production for smaller artists; you can imagine how thrilled Imagine Dragons were.“Lo/Hi,” the Black Keys’ first song in five years, opens with a revitalized yelp from Auerbach, but it sounds like no time has passed at all. They’re still sleepily ripping off ZZ Top and there’s a demonic little solo two minutes in that could reignite the white-hot suburban-dad beef between Auerbach and the Whole Foods to his Trader Joe’s, Jack White. No one expects soul-searching poetry from two white guys from the Rust Belt working in the blues tradition, but the “when I get low I get high” trope they structure the song around is one of the oldest tricks in the book, from Ella Fitzgerald to Ryan Adams. One promising new development in the duo’s sound is the addition of soulful female backup singers, Nashville’s Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson, who introduce a welcome texture to a tune that’s otherwise wholly unsurprising.",articles4,"['Black Keys', 'Auerbach', 'ZZ Top', 'Auerbach', 'Trader Joe’s']"

"King also interviewed Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary, with Kelly present in the roomThe second part of R. Kelly’s conversation with Gayle King on “CBS This Morning” aired on March 7. It marked Kelly’s first interview since being arrested and charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse in Cook County, Illinois.In the second portion of the interview, Kelly discussed his financial situation, telling King that “people have been stealing my money.” According to CBS, the first time he went into a branch of his bank alone to assess his finances was February 21, only a day before he was arrested on charges of sexual abuse on February 22. He told King that he was in the midst of moving $350,000 between bank accounts when he was arrested.Kelly—who was taken into police custody on March 6 in Chicago after failing to pay $161,000 in child support—addressed his child support situation as well, bursting into tears and beginning to yell. “How can I pay child support? How? If my ex-wife [Andrea Kelly] is destroying my name and I can't work? How can I work, how can I get paid, how can I take care of my kids?” he exclaimed.Kelly also unequivocally denied ever abusing Andrea Kelly, who has previously accused the singer of domestic abuse during their marriage. “She's not telling the truth. I have nothing against her, that is my kids’ mother... I'm not disrespecting her by saying she's not telling the truth, I'm just being honest.” Kelly then grew agitated again: “Someone sent me something on my phone saying that I hogtied her. I don't know how to hogtie people! Why would I do that? What kind of woman would tear down a dad who's trying to have a relationship with their kids? You know how many kids need a relationship with their father?”Joycelyn Savage (age 21) and Azriel Clary (23)—two women who live with Kelly, who the singer regards as his “girlfriends”—reaffirmed their relationships with Kelly while sitting down with King. (Despite an agreement that to the contrary, Kelly was allowed into the room during their interviews, King says.) Clary, who met Kelly when she was 17, denied ever having sex with him while underage. “When I first met Robert, my parents told me to lie about my age. So when I met him, he thought that was 18,” she said, claiming that her parents wanted explicit materials to blackmail Kelly. “When I was 17, my parents were trying to get me to take photos with him, sexual videos with him, all kinds of stuff.” Pitchfork has emailed “CBS: This Morning” representatives for comment on Kelly’s presence during their interview.Kelly, Savage, and Clary all deny that Kelly ever promised any sort of music mentorship for the women, with Kelly claiming that Joycelyn Savage’s mother was the one who pushed for the young woman to pursue singing. Clary also stated that she attempted suicide as a result of her parents pressuring her into pursuing music. (CBS confirmed via medical records that Clary did attempt to take her own life, but reported that according to concurrent notes from her doctor, the suicide attempt was due to a bad breakup with a boyfriend.)After the airing of the March 7 episode of “CBS This Morning,” the celebrity attorney Michael J. Avenatti, who is representing Azriel Clary’s parents Alice Angelo, released the following statement:https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/1103685591198134273On March 8, CBS aired an extended version of Gayle King’s interview with Kelly, during which the singer discussed the meaning behind his 19-minute song “I Admit,” the dynamics in his domestic relationships, and his decision to eat at McDonald’s shortly after being released from jail on bond last month. You can watch the full interview here.When King asked Kelly about his alleged need to be “in control” in relationships, Kelly responded: “No, no, no, no, no. See the thing is that, I’m not a controlling person, it’s just that I am in control of my household. Like, say, if you live with me, I consider myself the King of the castle, and you the Queen of the castle.”CBS also spoke with Asante McGee and Kitti Jones, both of whom have detailed allegations of abuse against Kelly in the past. Michelle Kramer was also interviewed by CBS, claiming that her daughter, Dominique Gardner, was abused by Kelly. All three women have previously discussed these allegations in Lifetime’s six-part docuseries “Surviving R. Kelly.”During part one of the interview, which aired on March 6, Kelly addressed his relationships with Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary and responded to allegations made in the Lifetime docuseries “Surviving R.

The charges stem from incidents that allegedly occurred between 1998 to 2010. They involve three underage girls and one 24-year-old woman.R.

"Perhaps you have felt Meg Duffy’s aura without even knowing it. The guitarist has been a subtle but vital presence on some of the most ambitious rock records in recent memory. You can hear their nimble, swirling guitar tone on the War on Drugs’ , Weyes Blood’s , and most recently, William Tyler’s . Whether it’s a pivotal slide guitar melody or a simple chord progression, Duffy’s contributions radiate a sense of serenity, as though there is a deep trust between player and instrument.A similar ease is felt in Duffy’s solo project Hand Habits, which began while they were living and playing with local artists in Albany, just after finishing music school. Following a few brief, collaborative Hand Habits releases, Duffy crossed paths with Kevin Morby in 2015, when one of their other projects, Better Pills, opened for the then-rising singer-songwriter. This presented the right reason to leave upstate New York: They moved to L.A. and starting playing lead guitar in Morby’s band. Four years and many collaborations later, Hand Habits is back on the frontburner for Duffy.Recorded between tours, Hand Habits’ 2017 debut LP, , demonstrated a meditative tenderness far from the role of guitar shredder, as seen on the road with Morby. On HH’s newly released follow-up, , Duffy plumbs new depths of intimacy when it comes to the topics of anxiety, loss, and forgiveness. Unlike the self-produced ,  was the result of fruitful team-ups with another behind-the-scenes indie-rock favorite, producer Brad Cook, at Justin Vernon’s Wisconsin studio, as well as Andrew Sarlo (Big Thief, Nick Hakim producer) closer to home. It’s an album that asserts Duffy as a bandleader in their own regard.Calling from the Echo Park home they share with a group of fellow musicians (Lætitia Tamko of Vagabon among them), Duffy exudes an infectious chill as they discuss finding their solo voice, life as a session musician, and their deep connection to the guitar.Meg Duffy: I think meeting Emily Sprague [Florist, emerging modular synth wizard] and a lot of the bands she was playing with [Told Slant, Bellows, Small Wonder] really changed things for me. It made me check in with what kind of music I actually enjoyed listening to. When Emily and I recorded the first Hand Habits songs [in 2013], “Be Yr Man” and “Bloom,” I felt able to use the simplicity of the platform to express a truth that I didn’t know I was capable of expressing. It was just me and her, and the recordings became softer and slower. It really helped me figure out how performing could feel comfortable to me and how hearing my own recordings could feel comfortable too.I find the vehicle for mediumship to the spirit—or whatever artistic “other” there is that comes in and allows artists to access what they have to say—comes a lot easier for me when things are simplified. Emily’s songwriting had a big impact on me because I found myself feeling really emotionally connected to her songs, and they were like three chords.It’s taught me how to not shred over a song that doesn’t need to be shredded over. Even going wicked far back to when I was playing guitar with songwriters in Albany, who I learned so much from playing with, it wasn’t about me. That was important to learn, because when you’re in music school, it is very much about you and your practice. But then when you’re at a bar and there’s someone shredding vocals, singing their songs, it’s not about you. It’s challenging to figure out where you fit as a guitar player. Going into studios to work, whether people wanted a solo, some sort of chordal addition, or a sonic kind of glue thing, forced me to realize that the guitar is not the main event, it’s really just there to add emotional or melodic content to a song. Sometimes with Kevin there would be moments where I would play out in the live show, and we would solo together. But then there are some songs where I just play a chord because that’s what’s needed. It’s a humbling experience, but it’s also crucial because you are doing something subconsciously that heavily contributes to the performance.It’s strange. The first time it happened was on the Weyes Blood record [], I play a slide solo on “Seven Words.” We wrote that together, but she was giving me a lot of prompts. But I play it on the record and then I saw her play in L.A. and watching someone else play the solo was weird! Adam [Granduciel] asked me to play when War on Drugs performed on “Jimmy Kimmel” and I sort of thought I would be playing the slide part that I wrote and I ended up just playing acoustic guitar. It was cool, but sort of strange to be like, . As a session player I think you have to be okay with that. I really appreciate the opportunity Adam gave me and admittedly people know who I am sometimes just from the liner notes of that record because it’s such a big record, it won a Grammy! From a financial standpoint it’s strange to do because I don’t gain that much from contributing that much. But that’s the name of the game sometimes, and that’s okay because you're helping people make cool music and make it better—and that’s soul deposits.Definitely both, because I can’t really separate me from my voice on the guitar. I’m not one of those people who can recreate anything on the guitar, which a lot of studio musicians do because that’s how you get a lot of work. I can’t pinpoint it directly, but I think what I do is very specific and it doesn’t work on everything.I don’t know that I would say this unless asked, but I have a good sense of melody. That brings up a philosophical roadblock—like, what’s good and what’s bad?—but I feel really connected to my instrument, the guitar, melodically, often more so than I do vocally. Also, I’ve done more slide sessions now than not. Two of the biggest sessions I’ve done that have gone to tape have been slide sessions and I didn’t really consider myself a slide player.I met William through his sister Elise, who directed a music video [“Paradise”] for Kevin a long time ago. Elise and William used to own a venue called the Stone Fox in Nashville, so I might have met him there. But in 2017, when I played with Kevin at Primavera, William invited me to come up and jam and the three of us—me, him, and Brad— ended up hanging. Then I had my session with Brad and he was managing William, so Brad kind of brought me into his world.If I hadn’t done the William session, I don’t think I would have ever gotten the chance to work with Tucker [Martine, classic ’00s indie-rock producer], who I was a big fan of. Working with Tucker was incredible in and of itself, but then I went back to his studio and he mixed my record to tape.Being a part of that record with William was amazing because we all arranged our parts on the spot, live, in the studio. I felt really trusted. I remember being on the plane to Portland and feeling a little insecure, like, “I’m the youngest person going, I’m the only non-male person, why do I need to be there?” After the first day of feeling a little uncertain, I had a conversation with William and he was like, “Dude, I love your playing, I want your voice on this.” Hearing somebody who has made a career out of instrumental guitar—which is really hard to do!—say that, I felt really seen and appreciated and taken seriously. It made me realize I can be a part of the circuit. I mean, fucking Bill Frisell is the only other electric guitar that’s on that record.

And it comes up  often when the pair are discussing the Grateful Dead and their jam-band descendants Phish—which is a lot.On “Sunflower,” which features the Internet’s guitarist wunderkind Steve Lacy, Vampire Weekend keep the palette of the ’70s alive, though it is questionably tasteful. Koenig’s love for the Dead and Phish is obvious in the proggy bass scales that open the track, the frantically curling guitar licks, and even… the harmonized scatting that’s done in unison with the instruments. It’s kind of like Stevie Wonder’s “Sir Duke” by way of Guster. But “Sunflower” is not supposed to be serious, as evidenced from Ezra’s faint chatter at the top of the track and the actual sound of laughter heard in the background later on. The song keeps flirting with that fine line between the corny and the cool—returning to the same arch playfulness that Vampire Weekend had when they were once branded dismissively as Ivy League rockers. “Sunflower” is weirder and more psychedelic than the other three songs unveiled from their album so far, a peculiar new piece of the larger  puzzle.",articles4,"['Ezra Koenig', 'Koenig', 'Grateful Dead', 'Phish', 'Internet’s', 'Steve Lacy', 'Vampire Weekend', 'Koenig’s', 'Stevie Wonder’s', 'Ezra’s', 'Vampire Weekend']"

The case revolves around Knox, a rapper who was 19 when he was sentenced to 2-6 years in prison in 2014. He was charged with terroristic threats and witness intimidation, with prosecutors alleging his lyrics targeted specific police officers in Pittsburgh. The case has made its way to the Supreme Court, where Knox’s lawyers assert that his First Amendment rights are being violated.Now, Run the Jewels’ Killer Mike and a group of other rappers—including Chance the Rapper, Meek Mill, 21 Savage, Yo Gotti, Styles P, and more—have filed an  brief in the Supreme Court case in support of Knox, as The New York Times reports. The brief contains a “primer on rap music and hip-hop” as well as intricate breakdowns of the lyrics that were condemned as “terroristic threats.”“In short, this is a work of poetry. It is told from the perspective of two invented characters in the style of rap music, which is (in)famous for its exaggerated, sometimes violent rhetoric, and which uses language in a variety of complex ways,” the brief reads. “It is not intended to be taken literally, something that a reasonable listener with even a casual knowledge of rap would understand.” Find the full brief here.Killer Mike was previously part of a similar brief along with Big Boi and T.I. back in 2015. That Supreme Court case was about a high school student who was suspended for alleging sexual misconduct among two high school coaches and allegedly “threatening two named educators with gun-related violence.” Bell was suing to get the suspension removed from his record.

"“I have no clue why it’s in there, other than I was outta my head and it’s possibly greatly embellished or [I] made it up”In the 2001 Mötley Crüe memoir The Dirt, bassist Nikki Sixx tells a story involving a possible sexual assault. In the book, co-written by the band and Neil Strauss, Sixx writes about a sexual encounter at a party with a woman who, the next morning, called him and said, “Nikki, I got raped last night.” Sixx also wrote that the woman told him the alleged assault was committed by a man who picked her up hitchhiking later that night. Sixx reflected, “At first, I was relieved, because it meant I hadn’t raped her. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I pretty much had.”Nikki Sixx has now apologized for the story, which he calls “possibly greatly embellished,” Rolling Stone reports. In his full statement, given to , Sixx said:The book was written in 2000 during a really low point in my life. I
had lost my sobriety and was using drugs and alcohol to deal with a
disintegrating relationship which I still to this day regret how I
handled.... I honestly don’t recall a lot of the interviews with Neil.I went into rehab in 2001 and really wish I would’ve done my
interviews after I was clean and sober like I am today.I don’t actually recall that story in the book beyond reading it. I
have no clue why its  in there other than I was outta my head
and it’s possibly greatly embellished or [I] made it up. Those words
were irresponsible on my part. I am sorry.There is a lot of horrible behavior in the book.What I can tell you is that we all lived to regret a lot and learned
from it.We own up to all our behavior that hurt our selves, our families,
friends and any innocents around us.In a previous interview with Kory Grow for , Nikki Sixx said, “There was a little bit of embellishment here and there with Neil Strauss.” Pitchfork has contacted representatives for Mötley Crüe for further comment.On March 22, Netflix will release a movie based on .

"He filed the complaint last November in Toronto courtCanadian musician and producer Owen Pallett has settled a defamation lawsuit against a woman who accused him of sexual assault, according to the parties involved.In a complaint in Toronto court obtained by Pitchfork, Pallett (whose real name is Michael James Owen Plowright) accused the woman of “falsely and maliciously” telling people in the music industry that he sexually assaulted her. Pallett claimed an unspecified amount in monetary damages, including “punitive, aggravated, and exemplary damages,” plus interest and legal costs. He also sought a permanent injunction preventing the woman from making defamatory statements about him. (Pitchfork has chosen to withhold the woman’s name out of respect for her privacy.)In the 12-page complaint filed in Ontario Superior Court of Justice on November 15, 2018, Pallett denied sexually assaulting the woman. The complaint said the two met in roughly January 2015, when she attended one of his performances in New York, and they became friends. On separate occasions in 2016 and 2018, Pallett claimed, the two engaged in an undisclosed number of “intimate encounters,” generally initiated by the woman and always with her explicit consent. In spring and fall of 2018, according to the complaint, the woman “told a number of music industry professionals that Owen sexually assaulted her.”Pallett’s lawsuit claimed the woman made the allegedly defamatory statements “in order to manipulate him, seek monetary advances from him, ruin his career, and punish him for not reciprocating her requests for intimacy.”In a joint statement given to Pitchfork, Pallett and the woman said they have now amicably resolved the matter. “We have apologized, and forgiven each other for our respective actions and statements,” they said. (When checked by Pitchfork, legal documents settling the case weren’t yet on file.)Update (03/11 12:15 p.m. ET): Pallett’s lawyer has provided to Pitchfork what appears to be a signed apology from the woman stating that the relationship was at all times consensual. The apology was contained in an email dated March 2 that also was said to include the signed settlement agreement (all pages of which, as supplied to Pitchfork, were redacted). The woman and her lawyer have not responded to Pitchfork’s requests for confirmation of the signed apology.If you or someone you know has been affected by sexual violence and need to talk, we recommend these resources:RAINN

"The singer angrily denies sexual abuse and responds to Lady Gaga’s apology for working with himThe first part of a new interview with R. Kelly—his first since being charged with 10 counts of aggravated sexual abuse in Cook County, Illinois—aired Wednesday, March 6 on “CBS This Morning.” The second part airs Thursday, March 7. In the interview with Gayle King, Kelly angrily denies the accusations of being involved with underage girls. “Whether they’re old rumors, new rumors, future rumors—not true.” In another section of the interview, Kelly’s responses become more emotional and confrontational. Watch it below.In the first part of the interview, King asks Kelly about his relationship with Joycelyn Savage (age 21) and Azriel Clary (23), two women who live with R. Kelly and have supported him publicly. He responds, “I love ’em and it’s almost—it’s like they’re my girlfriends. It’s like, you know, we have a relationship. It’s real. And I know guys—like, I’ve known guys all my life that have five or six women, okay? So don’t go there on me, okay? ’Cause that’s the truth.”Asked about the severe age gap between himself and the women, he says, “I don’t look at much younger than me. I just look at legal. I just look at you’re you, I’m me. Now, I don’t know if you're married. I don’t know. I don’t know if you have a relationship. I don’t know what you – you know, I don’t know. But one might be older than the other. One might be younger than the other, okay? So I just look at legal, okay? People. There are older men that like younger women … there are younger women that like older men.”Kelly goes on to claim that Savage’s father brought her to one of his shows when she was 19. Clary’s parents say they took their daughter to an R. Kelly concert when she was 17, hoping he would make her his protégé, according to CBS. Kelly denied they had sex when Clary was 17: “Absolutely not. Although, her parents wanted me to,” he claims. The parents claim they have text messages proving Kelly had sex with her when she was 17. Kelly responded, “Claim, claim.”He goes on to claim that Savage and Clary “handed” their daughters to him, saying, “What kind of father, what kind of mother, will sell their daughter to a man? How come it was okay for me to see them until they wasn't getting no money from me?” Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who says he is representing Alice and Angelo Clary, issued a statement denying the claim:https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/1103286370183766016During a press conference held on March 6, Joycelyn Savage’s parents denied Kelly’s claims that they had ever accepted money from him. “I can state here, unequivocally, that at no point have the Savages requested money from Mr. Robert Sylvester Kelly, they have never received any money from Robert Sylvester Kelly, they don’t want any money from Robert Sylvester Kelly.”In a segment airing Thursday, Joycelyn Savage and Azriel Clary defend Kelly. “You guys believe in some facade that our parents are saying,” Clary says. “This is all lies for money.”In a different clip, King brings up Lady Gaga’s apology for working with Kelly. “The interesting thing about this is the fact, working with Lady Gaga, she’s a very great talent and all,” Kelly said. “It’s unfortunate that her intelligence go to such a short level when it comes to that.”On Friday, February 22, Kelly turned himself in to authorities and pled not guilty to the aggravated criminal sexual abuse charges. He was released from jail on bond on February 25. The charges, which stem from incidents that allegedly happened from 1998 to 2010, involve three underage girls and one 24-year-old woman.In a separate case, R.

"Necessity, rather than fate, brought Maria Minerva and Chelsea Faith Dolan together. It was 2013 and Minerva had recently immigrated to the United States from Estonia. The songwriter and producer was planning a tour across America, but she didn’t know how to drive yet. Britt Brown, one of the co-owners of Minerva’s label 100% Silk, mentioned Dolan, who’d released music on the label as Cherushii. “He was like, ‘There’s this girl in San Francisco who makes house music and you’re going to get along,’” Minerva says. “‘She also has a car and is such a music enthusiast that she wouldn’t mind just driving your ass around.’”Over the weeks they spent driving through vast sprawls of nothingness, Minerva and Cherushii became fast friends. “She was kind of like a bigger sister,” Minerva says. “She was an easy-going person with a very warm presence.” Once Minerva moved to Los Angeles—as a licensed driver, thanks to Dolan’s constant encouragement—each would take turns trekking across California to perform together. After collaborating on a track for Cherushii’s 2015 record , the duo realized their friendship naturally translated into a musical partnership. Shortly after, they began working on an EP, , which was intended to precede their full-length.On December 2, 2016, Dolan was playing a set at the Ghost Ship, a massive warehouse turned performance space and artist residence in Oakland. Around 11 p.m., a fire broke out and quickly spread, trapping showgoers and tenants in a maze of makeshift staircases and shabby bric-a-brac. Even as the flames still burned, questions arose: What had caused the fire, who was to blame, and how many will suffer because of Oakland’s housing crisis? In the end, 36 individuals died, including Dolan.By that point, the EP was almost complete, with Minerva planning to visit the Bay Area the following month to finish it up. With the help of Dolan’s partner and two trusted producers, Minerva tied up the loose ends, reworked the extra material, and released the record last month via 100% Silk. Though its story is marked by tragedy,  exudes an undeniable joy borne of the empowering friendship shared by these two women. “The songs could never be perfect because she’s not here to finish them with me,” says Minerva, “but I think she’d be very pleased with what we did come up with.”In her own words, Minerva remembers Dolan and the tricky process of finishing what they so effortlessly began.We were instant besties. I was blown away because I have usually very low expectations for everything and anything. It’s harder and harder to connect with people the older you get. Obviously it helped that we were stuck in this car together for many weeks and had a lot of fun, interesting adventures.When you’re adults and you live in different cities, sometimes it’s hard to stay connected. But with her, it was never a problem. I would go out to San Francisco and she came to L.A. to play shows. We did a track called “Thin Line.” I think it’s one of the best songs I’ve ever made, even though it was a collaboration. It was so quick and organic [to make it], we both realized we should continue working on tracks and pretty much started right away.It was just so fucking easy to work together. Sometimes we would giddily dream about producing for pop stars. I know a lot of underground artists have those types of dreams, but it’s so fun when you actually have someone to play around beside you. We had this talk about feminism and what it means when two women are making music together. There’s no weird ego, it’s just two authors who share a vision. It’s so hard to find that person.We wanted to make a record for dance floors. I wanted it to be something that you would hear at a gay club, something for the gays and the girls, if that makes sense. That’s just one of the places where I feel happiest and safest, where there seems to be an abundance of possibilities when you’re on the dance floor. We tried to capture that mood.The tracks on the album are pretty much half hers, half mine. I had these bare-bones demos that sounded like shit [for what would become “Out by Myself” and “A Day Without You”], and she beautified the production. Others were demos that she sent me that I laid vocals over, like “Thin Line.” “Nobody’s Fool (Vocal Version)” is [a rework] of a track of hers that had already come out. It came together when we were preparing for a show [in September of 2016] at the Folsom Street Fair, this huge BDSM event in the streets of San Francisco where a ton of naked people get spanked in broad daylight. She was playing on a Sunday at like, 11 a.m., so I came to San Francisco and performed the two tracks we had at the time to five extremely enthusiastic leather fanatics. That was the last time I saw her.I had gone to a house party in L.A. on December 2nd, a very regular Friday night. I turned on my phone the next morning and had all these notifications and messages. Even my mom, who is still in Europe, had messaged me the news about the fire in Oakland—it was already on BBC World News on the other side of the world. My first thought was obviously Chelsea. There was a lot of confusion, no one knew exactly who was at the event. A few days later, we got the official confirmation. That’s the part the bothers me the most, knowing that she was in that warehouse for an additional two or three days after the actual fire. Those first days of waiting and scrolling and refreshing were the worst days of my entire life.After the fire, I knew the record had to get finished. The main reason why it took so long was that it was hard to get my hands on the files and figure out where everything was. I never actually accessed her computer, I just had her boyfriend mail me the files on a flashdrive. Unsurprisingly, Chelsea was very organized. She organized her files by date, so it took a minute to go through them all; sometimes you don’t want the latest version. Everything was up in the air at that point for the label as well. 100% Silk got sued [by families of two of the deceased, as part of a wrongful death suit]. They were cleared of the lawsuit, but it took almost a year.One of the first things I did was re-record all my vocals with my friend Adam Gunther, who is a producer here in L.A. Brian [Foote, of the label Kranky] helped with some mixing and structural changes. And then David Last, Chelsea’s aforementioned partner, helped finalize a few of the tracks. I had been really overwhelmed for a second, I was like, “I don’t have the files, I don’t have the gear that we need to do a specific thing that she did, I don’t know how to tackle this.” But once those three people stepped in, I was able to organize my thoughts and the process. I couldn’t drop the ball on this. I would never forgive myself.We had the vision for these songs nailed down—with the exception of “Boyfriend Shirt.” We never actually worked on it together, it was a demo she sent me that I wasn’t really feeling at first. After the fire I realized there’s not going to be any more music, so I wanted to use everything we had. I thought about what I could do with that demo. It was one of the few things that I remember that she was singing on. I know for a fact that she would have been completely fine with me making it into something else because she always welcomed every idea I proposed. But that one was hard because we never really discussed it. It was also just weird to hear her sing, because when a person’s gone, hearing their voice is very triggering.I first wrote “This Must Be the Place” about my hometown, Tallinn. When I came to Los Angeles, the lyrics spoke to me again. Tallinn and L.A. are both car-centric places with a lot of dead space. There is a line in the song that goes, “Greater than fear of unexpected violence is the fear of everlasting silence.” When I originally wrote it, this was a reference to urban exploration or feeling alienated in your environment. But by the time it made it on the record, that line reminded of that event. The fire was obviously the unexpected violence, and now that the record’s out and there’s not going to be any more music, that’s the silence.The line “This must be the place where even buses don’t go” is in reference to how poorly connected Tallinn and to Los Angeles are when it comes to public transportation. But that can also actually apply to some parts of Oakland and the Bay Area that are not yet gentrified. When I think about the warehouse space and where everything went down, I think it does capture something about that event, even though it happened retroactively.In Europe, I almost never went to a music show in someone’s basement or garage or living room. That was something I only ever experienced when I moved to the United States. House shows and warehouse shows are as American as apple pie, in my opinion. They are one of the best parts of the underground culture here. But the other side of the coin is the high cost of housing, the way artists don’t get grants from the government, that there are no foundations for underground music—no one cares, basically. You end up putting yourself in a very dangerous, precarious situation.",articles4,"['Dolan', 'Dolan’s', 'Dolan', 'Dolan', 'Dolan’s', 'Dolan', 'BDSM', 'Chelsea', 'Those', 'Chelsea', 'Adam Gunther', 'Foote', 'Chelsea’s']"

Mac DeMarco’s most recent album, 2017’s acoustic guitar-favoring , was an impeccable, if low-stakes record, a welcome stroll into singer-songwriter maturity from DeMarco. Listening to “Nobody,” the first single from his forthcoming album, , can be a bit like noticing a longtime friend’s hair has sprouted a spot or two of silver since you last met, but it’s only made them look more distinguished.“Nobody” continues ’s progression into carefully crafted simplicity, and it manages to hold on to DeMarco’s distinctive, slightly off-kilter perspective, too. The arrangement is bare and gorgeously recorded, with muted horns drifting in over gentle percussion and skeletal strums. “For the creature on television/There’s no turning back to nobody,” he sings, with disarming tenderness. DeMarco here seems to be calling on us to empathize with the washed-up celebrities splashed across TMZ, at a time when he sounds less like an upstart seeking attention than someone who knows to make the most of the attention he’s got.",articles4,"['Mac DeMarco', 'DeMarco’s']"

"Sitting in the lobby of a swanky hotel near Chicago’s Millennium Park, William Basinski is doing his best Salvador Dalí impression, twirling the ends of an invisible mustache before bursting into laughter. The avant-garde luminary is best known for his devastating requiem for 9/11, , but in conversation he’s loose and light.

The music itself is a deeply process-oriented work, capturing the sound of physical tape as it falls apart.

Photo by Matt Lief Anderson.William Basinski: I can’t perform  [] They’re gone. So it’s going to be different every time, because each conductor makes it theirs. For example, we did it last year with the Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra, and we had this great Belarusan conductor, and he took it  slow.In Chicago, it was [arranger Maxim Moston’s] interpretation and orchestration. Max knew the work, lived with it, even before I had asked him to arrange it. He has incredible ears. It’s all written out, there are no repeats in the score. Some other things about his orchestration, for example: The trombones and French horn players, they’re playing the melody, and it’s a lot on your lips. And one of the percussionists was crinkling cling wrap into the microphone to emulate the tape noise. There are no electronics in this piece, it’s all analog.My friends Dmitry Gelfand and Evelina Domnitch are just these incredibly smart and beautiful artists working in this new field of art science. They were working with some of the LIGO guys, crafting this piece that shows how black holes can create wormholes, connected together at the bottom of these counter-clockwise spinning vortices. I went to CalTech for a lecture they did, and at a cocktail hour afterwards, I was introduced to one of the scientists from LIGO, who was a fan of mine. So he comes up and says, “You know, we have some recordings of gravitational waves—would you want to do something with them?” And I said, “Hell yeah!”I started with what they gave me, but I didn’t use all of it because some of it was really scary, and then I extrapolated with my imagination, how these waves traveled billions of years to come to earth. It’s a love story between two fucking black holes, creating a rift in space time with more energy than all the stars in the known universe. It’s a romantic love story.Basinski performing his solo set at Midwinter on 2/16/2019. Photo by Maria Louceiro.My dad worked for NASA when we were kids, he helped put men on the moon. Dad was working for a contractor that was doing something for the lunar module. We didn’t know that then; he wasn’t allowed to talk about it, and it was all need-to-know. We watched the rockets go up. I mean, it was fascinating. I grew up with these space guys and, of course, Bowie, the Starman.I was in Celeste, Texas, at [longtime partner and artist James Elaine’s] family’s ranch, after a big tour. And I woke up, and there were alerts going on my phone. Everyone was just saying, “Bowie, Bowie, Bowie.” I was devastated. And we were stuck down in Celeste! Nobody was playing him on the radio—it’s all country music down there. And I was like, “God, what am I doing in fucking Celeste?!” Just couldn’t believe it. How can we live in a world without Bowie, but fucking Dick Cheney is still haunting everybody without a heart, and all these other assholes never die?

"Listen to the track belowFour Tet’s edit of Nelly Furtado’s “Afraid” has been floating around for a while now: Clubbers and festivalgoers reported hearing it in sets across Europe last summer, played not only by Four Tet but also other DJs, like Peggy Gou, Jackmaster, Hunee, and Bicep. Now, apparently having cleared the sample, Four Tet’s Kieran Hebden has given it an official release. Curiously, it appears under a new alias, the initials KH, which Hebden previously used on another fan-favorite edit, 2013’s “The Track I’ve Been Playing That People Keep Asking About and That Joy Used in His RA Mix and Daphni Played on Boiler Room.” (“KH” is certainly easier to type into Spotify than another recent alias of his, ⣎⡇ꉺლ༽இ•̛)ྀ◞ ༎ຶ ༽ৣৢ؞ৢ؞ؖ ꉺლ)The original comes from Furtado’s 2006 album , and anyone who knows the song will recognize it in Hebden’s edit immediately, never mind the fact that her synth-soaked, alt-rock/R&B hybrid couldn’t be further from Four Tet’s clean-lined corkscrew of a floor destroyer. His beat is a spring-loaded groove injected with a heavy dose of UK garage’s swing; as for the hook, he quickly zeroes in on Furtado’s chorus with eagle-eyed tenacity and refuses to let up. Multi-tracked and cushioned in echo, the vocals have the sing-song feel of a playground chant, but few children’s songs are quite as empathic as this one. “You’re so afraid of what people might say/But that’s okay ’cause you’re only human,” begins the breathless refrain, spinning through a dizzy series of repetitions, before landing on the kicker: “You’re going to break/So please don’t do it.” Self-care has rarely sounded this exhilarating.",articles4,"['Nelly Furtado’s', 'Four Tet', 'Daphni Played', 'Four Tet’s']"

"On the philosophical fever dream of a sitcom that is “The Good Place,” D’Arcy Carden plays Janet, an upbeat, helpful humanoid who knows everything that’s ever happened in the entire universe. And it turns out Carden is kind of like a real-life Janet when it comes to music trivia. As a kid, the actress’ mom and dad, who founded the Bay Area music magazine  in the ’70s, used to test her and her sisters’ pop expertise. “If any song came on the radio, my mom would say, ‘Who’s playing drums on this song?’ Or, like, ‘Who produced this album?’ ‘Who’s the guest singer on this?’” Carden recalls. “Then she would give whoever answered first random points that never got added up to any total. But it was definitely a point of pride.”Thanks to her music-loving parents, Carden also makes for a great concert buddy. At age 4, she saw her first show—Huey Lewis and the News—and the night has become the stuff of legends in her house. The Cardens were invited backstage after the gig, but Huey wasn’t in a great mood because he didn’t think the show was up to snuff. Then he met little D’Arcy. “My dad likes to say that Huey walked out of his dressing room holding my hand and was in a much better mood,” she says. “He was like, ‘I feel better knowing this little 4-year-old liked the show,’ which is wild.”Such a musical childhood might help explain why the bands of Carden’s teenage years—specifically the ones she encountered in 1993—are still so omnipresent in her life. Whether they encouraged a 13-year-old Carden to change her name ever so slightly, or ended up inspiring Janet’s robot voice, this is the music that still holds a special place in her heart today.I put an apostrophe in my name that wasn’t there before, like Smashing Pumpkins bassist D’Arcy Wretzky, because of how influential this band was to me. D’Arcy was just the epitome of cool to me. In 1993, I was really into alternative and grunge music, and whereas the Nirvanas and the Pearl Jams felt so masculine, there was something sweeter and lighter about Smashing Pumpkins. The fact that they had a girl in their band was huge for me and my friends. I learned the guitar part to “Today,” and it made me feel like such a badass. It was like, “Wow, I can play guitar!” But, of course, anybody can play the beginning of “Today.”Billy Corgan has one of those voices to me where—and this is gonna sound like an insult but I truly mean it as a compliment—it’s like, why the hell did he think he could be the lead singer of a band? His voice is so weird, and I’m sure there was a choir teacher or some asshole friend who was like, “You don’t have a good voice.” Yet he continued to sing. And I’m glad he did, because he made all these really good songs.At this point, like a lot of people, I have a love-hate relationship with Smashing Pumpkins. I love the music, but the more I learn about the people behind the music, it’s harder. But that is the case with a lot of the art that we love. There are so many things from your teen and pre-teen years you were obsessed with and absorbed every bit of and then, later on, you’re like, “Oh no! That guy’s an asshole.”Being so obsessed with D’Arcy Wretzky led me right to my love of the Breeders and their second album, . The Breeders didn’t look like the other girls. They didn’t wear a ton of makeup or sexy clothes. They weren’t pop stars. They redefined what it meant to be a woman in music, and it was super eye-opening for me.And they were led by two sisters. I have two sisters, and if I could make one wish on a magic lamp, I would wish to be in a rock band with them. I also have an aunt who was in a punk band in the ’80s, and she is the coolest person in my life. She always had rocker boyfriends and was very influential on what I thought was cool and still think is cool. To me, my aunt Sally could have been in the Breeders. It was all part of my little secret fantasy world of being in a band with my family members: “Well, Aunt Sally could be in the Breeders and then, of course, they’d invite me to be in the Breeders and then I’d be a Breeder.”It was one of those things where the Breeders felt like my little secret, but in a way where everybody knew who they were because they had a huge hit with “Cannonball.” But it was always a special thing when you connected with someone else that knew their songs. I still listen to  constantly. is one of my favorite albums of all time. It’s such a go-to. In junior high and high school I always knew it would be a hit if I put it on, and I still feel that way: If I was DJing at a party I would put “Award Tour” on and know I was doing a good job. I was listening to it recently, and there’s like a female robot voice that speaks in between each song—I honestly think she has more of an influence over Janet then Siri or Alexa or any of those. I know this sounds crazy, but over the last few years, so many people have asked, “Is Janet based on Siri or Alexa?” and I’ve always been like, “Not exactly.” Siri and Alexa answer one question, but the voice on  is giving you the full story. So when I was listening to it with new ears, I was like, “Holy shit, the  lady is Janet!”",articles4,"['Janet', 'Janet', '”Thanks', 'Carden’s', 'Janet’s', 'Smashing Pumpkins', 'Smashing Pumpkins', '”Billy Corgan', 'I’m', 'Smashing Pumpkins', 'Breeder', 'Alexa', 'Alexa', 'Alexa']"

"Writer and art curator Antwaun Sargent moderated a talk with Solange during a city-wide Houston eventTonight in Houston, Solange hosted “album experience” events across Houston for her new album When I Get Home. The event, which streamed live on Apple Music and her BlackPlanet website, began with a screening of the Solange-directed  film and ended with a conversation between Solange and writer/art curator Antwaun Sargent.The new album features contributions from Panda Bear, Blood Orange, Cassie, Earl Sweatshirt, and others. During the conversation, Sargent asked Solange about her process of incorporating collaborators. “Editing is just such a huge part of my process,” she said. “I would say that it’s 80% editing, and for some reason, I just have the discipline for it.”She also discussed the process of giving collaborators the freedom to create on their own terms before deciding how to incorporate their contributions in the final product. “The best for me is to invite people into the space and say ‘do you.’ It could be six hours before I hear the one ad-lib or the one thing where I think, ‘OK, that is how I can extend this into an expression of what I want to achieve.’”She emphasized her role as the album’s producer, calling producing “my heart and soul.” “Speaking my truth, it is rather difficult as a producer to be reduced to just the songwriter or just the artist when you spend 18 hours editing one drum sound,” she said. “We’ve come a long way from that for women, but it’s still got a little ways to go—the way we’re able to have that conversation about Rick Rubin but we’re not extending that conversation to others.”When asked about the process of writing the new album, Solange revealed some musical inspirations she turned to at the time, including Stevie Wonder (and specifically his album ), Steve Reich, Alice Coltrane, and Sun Ra—music that emphasized repetition.She also discussed the difference between  and her previous album, 2016’s . “Obviously with  I had so much to say,” she said. “With this album I had so much to . Words would have been reductive to what I needed to feel and express. It’s in the sonics for me.”At the beginning of the talk, Solange revealed that she quietly rented a house in Houston to begin work on new music. “I think after touring the last record, there were a lot of things that were happening to my spirit—things that feel sort of out of control,” she said.Later, she discussed Texas’ influence on the  film. “I knew about a year and a half ago, it would be really really important to me to tell a story about black cowboys.” She added, “I feel so privileged to meet so many of these cowboys and hear their stories and see them pray before they go in the bull ring and see what they’re willing to do to their bodies for the sake of entertainment, which is something I can relate to.”She finished by addressing the feeling of being home in Houston for the album’s rollout. “It’s just joy everywhere,” she said. “It just feels good. That’s what home does for you. I could be anywhere in the world, but nothing is gonna make me feel like this place does.”Read “5 Takeaways From Solange’s New Album, ” over on the Pitch.",articles4,"['Writer', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Panda Bear', 'Blood Orange', 'Cassie', 'Sargent', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Stevie Wonder (', 'Steve Reich', 'Alice Coltrane']"

It was a great honour to work with him and Larry. George and Larry were very different personalities (Larry was a real character), but they made a great creative combination.It was released as a single and Kevin Godley directed the video. I loved working with Kevin—so imaginative and great fun. I’d worked with him and Lol Creme when they directed the video for Peter Gabriel’s song, Don’t Give Up.

"Glover sued his former label in 2018, claiming Glassnote owed him over $10,000 in streaming royaltiesIn September 2018, Donald Glover (aka Childish Gambino) filed a lawsuit against his former label Glassnote Records due to an ongoing royalties dispute between the two parties. Now, Glover and Glassnote have settled the dispute,  reports and Pitchfork can confirm.The 2018 lawsuit claimed that Glassnote owed Glover upwards of $10,000 in streaming royalties. It also stated that the independent record label had been miscalculating payments in breach of their licensing agreement. The allegations outlined in the suit included breaches of contract, good faith, fair dealing, and fiduciary duty, as well as negligence.Glover’s legal action was in response to a July 2018 complaint filed by Glassnote that requested a judge to mediate their contract dispute with Glover in court. “Donald Glover made a claim that he was owed 95% of SoundExchange royalties when we are legislatively and contractually required to share those royalties 50/45,” a Glassnote representative told Pitchfork earlier that year. “We are not asking for anything back from Donald Glover, just that we are able to retain the monies that are contractually and legally ours and that have already been paid to us.”Now, according to a stipulation of voluntary dismissal filed on Friday (March 1) in the New York Southern District Court, both parties have agreed to drop the dispute.Glover released three albums on Glassnote between 2011 and 2016 (Camp, Because the Internet, and “Awaken, My Love!”). In January 2018, it was announced that he had signed a deal with RCA.Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Glover and Glassnote for comment.Read “What Does Atlanta Hip-Hop Think of ‘Atlanta’ the Show?” on the Pitch.",articles4,"['Donald Glover', 'Glover’s', 'Donald Glover', 'Donald Glover', 'My Love!', 'Glover']"

"In , Michael Jackson comes off like a grinning hunter baiting a trap. According to alleged victims Wade Robson and James Safechuck, the pop icon would at first awe his young victims, relax them, and finally make them comfortable enough for him to lay a hand on their thighs and invite them into bed to perform sexual acts.The Michael Jackson of director Dan Reed’s two-part, four-hour HBO documentary, which airs this weekend, is a child-man for whom luxe hotel suites, the infamous Neverland Ranch estate in Santa Barbara, California, and first-class plane tickets weren’t enjoyable in themselves; they served as enticements to lure in children and their parents, while Jackson schemed to bed his favorite boys. Jackson could justify these heinous acts of which he is accused,  suggests, because he also regarded himself as a child.  (Safechuck’s mother recalls letting her son spend time alone with Jackson after the singer’s stylist described him as “like a 9-year-old little boy.”) Safechuck claims that Jackson began abusing him in the late ’80s after Jackson met the 10-year-old Safechuck.These accusations pile up, context-free. Committed to accretion as an approach impossible to separate from its moral fervor,  is a humdrum piece of filmmaking. Reed doesn’t employ the forensic concentration of documentarians like Barbara Kopple or Errol Morris. Nor does he play the part of the ruthless inquisitor, like Claude Lanzmann in his punishing 1985 film Shoah, about the survivors of Nazi concentration camps and the villains who brutalized them. Instead,  alternates between talking-head shots and file footage, with excerpts of phone messages Jackson left on one of the boys’ home answering machines sometimes woven in. For UK-born Reed, whose credits include documentaries on the  attacks and a stint on “Frontline,” having these subjects and their testimonies suffices. His appeal is to pathos.In Safechuck, thickly browed, with a quick, warm smile and faint hesitance of manner that suggests he’s still amazed at what he’s admitting, Reed has found an ideal camera subject. Safechuck’s story, which dominates the first half of the film, is that of a young SoCal Jackson obsessive who caught the singer’s eye after co-starring in a -era Pepsi commercial. After Jackson dispatched a film crew to the Safechuck home (“It was like an audition,” he says in the film), the boy and his family were whisked to Hawaii, where patience and Jackson’s shrewdness about the effect of luxury on average people led to Safechuck spending more time in the singer’s room. Later on, in Paris, Safechuck says Jackson “introduced me to masturbation.” By the time Safechuck got invited to the Neverland Ranch, he alleges that Jackson took him into the attics for sex.Wade Robson, a 7-year-old dancer of exceptional mobility when he met Jackson, tells a similar story of seduction and betrayal. In some ways, Robson’s account is sadder. While watching the film, it feels like Robson grew out his blond hair in a hopeless attempt to match the Michael’s jheri curls. Joy Robson, in typical showbiz-mom fashion, devoted herself to Wade’s career to the exclusion of her other children and husband, who was suffering from bipolar disorder. In 1990, Jackson gave the family their golden tickets to Neverland. Unlike the Safechucks, the Robsons were granted an RV trailer for a Grand Canyon trip as distraction while, according to Wade, Jackson molested him.Along with its central pair of stories,  contains material for another documentary about the credulity of parents. In the film, the confidence with which the Robsons and Safechucks evade the conflation of stoking their kids’ ambition and reveling in their access to privilege is striking. Mothers Stephanie Safechuck and Joy Robson project the sincerity of parents who might otherwise worry about leaving their kids alone at the park jungle gym for fear of guys like Michael Jackson. Yet they are also presented as willing victims, if not accessories. And their good cheer gets wearisome, if not chilling, as  runs on; Joy Robson in particular can’t stop punctuating her self-effacing cracks with smiles. But they get their comeuppance. Upon learning about Wade’s secret life and the extent to which he was still sifting through the wrack of his ruined childhood as a man in his 30s, Joy confesses: “He told me that he felt no emotion for me.” does not posit intersections between Jackson’s art—among the 20th century’s most euphoric and despairing pop music—and his alleged misdeeds. Both James Safechuck and Wade Robson refer to Jackson as “larger than life,” and so he remains, a Charles Foster Kane denied in this film even the chance to defend himself through exculpatory witnesses. Jackson does get one defense, in the form of snippets from his concerts, the rhythmic oomph of which will remind segments of the audience of what they will ignore for the sake of a good time. But that’s it. Although the Jackson estate wouldn’t have dared to license the music—it has already sued HBO for $100 million over the documentary—surely a great film would have ensnared the audience in its complicity. Screenwriter Evan Chandler’s accusations of sexual abuse against Jackson on behalf of his son, 13-year-old Jordan in 1993, happened at the same time when “Billie Jean” still got listeners on the dancefloor and the  theme became a surprise smash. The atomization accelerated by social media has made taking sides an easier conscience-free existence. Even Jackson defenders who haven’t read Gustave Flaubert’s axiom about artists remaining above their handiwork, paring their fingernails, have accepted a glib paraphrase: “Separate the artist from the art.”Documentaries can honor the gravity of their subjects’ accusations without playing like an attenuated “Dateline” episode. If Safechuck and Robson’s accounts are true, they need no reckoning with Jackson’s aesthetic legacy; the reckoning is for the audience. We can handle it. To complicate is not to excuse. In a review of Jackson’s 1991 album Dangerous, writer Chuck Eddy compared him to the Sex Pistols’ Johnny Rotten: “incomparably feral performers grossed out by their own animal desires.” In , Safechuck and Robson’s accusations cohere into a feral man surrendering—without conscience—to his animal desires. This is dangerous too. For one, this summer will mark a decade since Jackson’s death; only his most vehement Twitter claque can defend him now. Worse, the film’s absence of context—artistic, psychoanalytical, legal—leaves exposed the fact that two white men accused a black man of grotesque violations. By dangling the possibility of male-on-male rape,  reinforces stereotypes that go unrefuted. As the critic Jason King recently wrote on ,  “Whether or not the allegations presented in the film  true, and whether or not it ever intended to do so,  dangerously reinforces the gay-folks-are-predators stereotype—if only because it never acknowledges that such a stereotype exists in the first place.”In its scrupulousness about playing fair toward Robson and Safechuck,  allows gruesome tropes about black men to hover as a mist inhaled and untested by Jackson’s musical descendants. Left unmentioned is that Robson went on to co-write *NSYNC’s “Pop” and “Gone” with Justin Timberlake, who proceeded to try to swallow Jackson’s legacy whole. Last fall, Drake scored another hit interpolating a Jackson-Paul Anka demo from 1983. What must Robson think when he hears these songs? His terrorizer won’t leave him alone. When asked about his family’s guilt near the end of , Safechuck says, “Do I blame them? I’m still working on it.” Reed’s cinematic deposition allows for no such ambivalences, to its detriment.",articles4,"['(Safechuck’s', 'In Safechuck', 'SoCal Jackson', 'Jackson’s', 'Robson’s', 'Wade’s', 'Wade’s', 'Gustave Flaubert’s', 'Robson’s', 'Jackson’s', 'Jackson’s', 'NSYNC’s', 'Justin Timberlake', 'Paul Anka', 'Reed’s']"

"Listen to the track belowJust ask any elder of the black community: Black faith is unwavering. And yet, at a time when blackness is up for grabs by the masses, Solange reminds us that the ownership of black culture by black people can never die. It is for us, by us, forever with us.On “Almeda,” the stand-out track on the artist’s fourth solo album When I Get Home, Solange draws heavily from the roots and traditions of her Southern black culture, specifically the influence of her hometown of Houston. Produced by Pharrell, frequent collaborator John Kirby, and Solange—and featuring a clever appearance by Playboi Carti—“Almeda” is a reinvented ode to the Houston-born chopped ’n’ screwed genre.Steady, trembling, synthetic percussion rattles underneath the track as Solange sings about the things which remain black-owned: black braids, black waves, and, especially, black skin. Others may imitate, but they can’t claim what was never theirs. Repetition is used two-fold here, both in the traditional production style of “chopped ‘n’ screwed” and as a means of emphasis on her lyrics. She seems to imply: .“Black faith still can't be washed away/Not even in that Florida Water,” she states definitively. A unisex cologne water known for its spiritual properties to cleanse negative energy, purify, and calm, it is no match for the strength, the binding universal force of black culture. “Pour more drank, drank/ Sip, sip, sip, sip, sip,” she repeats. We can continue celebrating, continue reveling in the power and beauty of ourselves.",articles4,"['Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Steady', 'Solange', 'Repetition']"
"Listen to the track belowOn the brink of missing the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, LeBron James shifted his focus to A&Ring 2 Chainz’s latest album, . For months, James took to his Instagram story to give hip-hop albums his stamp of approval. He could be seen bobbing his head with his durag tied tight, holding the occasional glass of wine as he listened to personal favorites like Drake and Kendrick. Eventually, James realized his own power as an influencer, which made these IG stories feel less like LeBron James co-signs and more like slick advertisements. (I heard Eminem’s  ’Bron, no way it deserved a “So dope!!!!”) Though his influence through most of  is hard to discern, “NCAA” is one of the songs where James seems to have directly inspired 2 Chainz.LeBron James and 2 Chainz connect on “NCAA” through their mutual awareness of the jig that is college sports. The ATL rapper was introduced to the injustices college athletes face—they bring in millions to the schools and see none of that money—during his days playing basketball at Alabama State University. James, who is a former No. 1 recruit, had the luxury of bypassing the traditional college ball-to-the-NBA path by going straight to the league from high school. On the song, 2 Chainz uses real-life examples of star athletes who excelled for their schools yet it wasn’t enough: “I have more crab legs than Jameis/You fake like you got a girlfriend, Manti Te’o.” There’s a never-ending cycle of young athletes being taken advantage of that both James and 2 Chainz have learned from as they have both taken full control of their respective careers.And though the track is critical of the NCAA’s treatment of players, the hook is still destined to soundtrack the upcoming March Madness: “NCAA, yeah, we the young and the dangerous.” The production from Honorable C.N.O.T.E was made for big game warmups with a haunting melody reminiscent of producer Lex Luger’s heyday and his pounding, celebratory drums. Having James put his name on “NCAA” raises the song’s profile, but it’s 2 Chainz who continues to be an ageless force in hip-hop.",articles4,"['Chainz’s', '’Bron', 'Chainz', 'Chainz', 'Chainz', 'Chainz', 'Lex Luger’s']"

"In true Knowles sister fashion, Solange revealed only a handful of clues about her new album, When I Get Home, ahead of its arrival last night. There was the  profile last October, in which the polymath artist gave her first short statement of intent behind the record. She said of the songs, “There is a lot of jazz at the core. But with electronic and hip-hop drum and bass because I want it to bang and make your trunk rattle.” More cryptically, she mentioned that the process of putting together her 2017 outdoor performance piece “Scales” caused a shift in perspective: “I realize how much wider, figuratively and literally, my work could be if I took myself away as subject.”Earlier this week, when Solange launched her customized BlackPlanet page, fans started to use her visual cues to decode what the  follow-up might possibly sound like. In various images, Solange is seen wearing chrome cowboy boots (a strong case for the ongoing “black yeehaw agenda”), shown naked in a 3D digital render, and draped in sci-fi clear plastic. The visual world that she presented was equally thrilling and perplexing; it was a portrayal of Texas as a black “Westworld,” processed through a hazy VSCO filter.But all the pieces of the puzzle clicked together when Solange released , a record equally indebted to cosmic jazz as it is to Houston’s signature druggy chopped ‘n’ screwed style. Over the course of 19 fluid tracks, Solange orchestrates a small army of collaborators, samples a few iconic (and hilarious!) black women, and shows love to her hometown. Here’s what you need to know going in.Ahead of the album, Solange shouted out two Houston rap heroes via her Instagram: Devin the Dude and Mike Jones. While the latter rapper doesn’t appear on , the former shows up on “Dreams” (a track that also features production by Earl Sweatshirt and Blood Orange’s Dev Hynes, as well as bass by Raphael Saadiq). It’s a full circle moment for Solo, who has covered Devin’s 2002 song “Doobie Ashtray”. Elsewhere, Geto Boys’ Scarface contributes his earth-rumbling vocals on the Standing on the Corner–produced “Not Screwed! (interlude).”Houston is not the only rich regional hip-hop scene that gets love throughout the record. Considering Atlanta’s stronghold on mainstream rap, it’s no surprise that Solange recruits the city’s longstanding titan Gucci Mane for the sluggish duet “My Skin My Logo.” Playboi Carti also makes a stand-out appearance on “Almeda,” his squeaky, oddball delivery punctuating the Solange/Pharrell production. Another unexpected vocal contributor on “Almeda” is trap production wizard Metro Boomin, who is also credited as co-producer on the bop “Stay Flo.”Aside from all the above-mentioned contributors, there are so many more that have added their touch to —even if their presences are not immediately obvious. The New York group Standing on the Corner scores several production credits, as does the cutting-edge French composer Chassol. Animal Collective’s Panda Bear also appears frequently throughout, co-producing the reggae-tinged “Binz” and contributing vocals to “Time (is),” “Beltway,” and “I’m a Witness.” Odd Future alums Tyler, the Creator and Earl Sweatshirt show up as co-producers on different songs—not a surprise considering that both of them are known homies with Solange.Other vocal features include Cassie on “Way to the Show”;  Sampha on “Time (is)”; Steve Lacy and Abra on “Sound of Rain”; The-Dream on “Binz”; and—last but not least—Solange’s son Julez on “Nothing Without Intention (Interlude).” Even when the  tracklist is stacked, the individual voices aren’t always awarded the spotlight. Often times, the features sound like they’re intended to blend in with the track—meaning that the artists here might have internalized Solange’s new philosophy of taking yourself “away as subject” and checked their egos at the door.Back in September, Earl Sweatshirt hosted an episode of his Red Bull Radio show “Earl Sweatshirt Stays Inside,” and Solange was a special guest. Together, the two chatted about their mutual love for Tierra Whack before Earl invited Standing on the Corner’s Shamel Cee Mystery (aka Gio Escobar) to the program. The episode actually predicted a lot about how both Solange’s  and Earl Sweatshirt’s latest album, , would sound. The two records are somehow both off-kilter and fluid, as samples punch in and out and songs flow into one another. This free-form, continuous production style could definitely be inspired by Standing on the Corner’s 2017 sample-heavy  project, which consists of two sprawling tracks that are both about 30 minutes long. Tierra Whack’s 2018 album , in which every song cuts off at the one-minute mark, also seems like a prototype for , whose brief interludes abruptly cut off.Like Master P and Solange’s parents serving as the narrators of , the voices of an eclectic range of iconic black women are weaved throughout . In a pointed decision to honor Houston’s Third Ward, the neighborhood she grew up in, Solange samples Phylicia Rashad reciting a poem called “On Status” written by Rashad’s mother Vivian Ayers-Allen in the 1987 TV movie “Superstars & Their Moms.” The track title—“S McGregor (interlude)”—refers to a Houston road. Solange also selects another Third Ward native, the late queer poet Pat Parker, to honor on “Exit Scott (interlude)”; Parker’s gorgeous love poem “Sunshine” opens the track.But Solange also has a sense of humor about her references. For “Can I Hold the Mic (interlude),” she samples the bickering of Diamond and Princess from Crime Mob, the Atlanta hip-hop group behind the crowd-rousing anthem “Knuck If You Buck.” On “We Deal With the Freak’n (intermission)” and “Binz,” Solo inserts the words of Atlanta sex guru Alexyss K. Tylor, whose claim to fame is her hilarious and outrageous public access TV show “Vagina Power,” which ran briefly from 2006 to 2007. Finally, “Nothing Without Intention (interlude)” centers around a sample of a YouTube video called “Florida Water For Cleansing and Clearing,” in which the  beauty vlogger Goddess Lula Belle breaks down exactly what Florida Water is. (Solo brought a bottle of the spiritual liquid to last year’s Met Gala.)",articles4,"['Knowles', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Westworld', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Devin the Dude', 'Mike Jones', 'Devin’s', 'Corner–', 'Animal Collective’s', 'Panda Bear', 'Solange', 'Sampha', 'Steve Lacy', 'The-Dream', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Phylicia Rashad', 'Third Ward', 'Parker’s', 'Diamond', 'Princess', 'Crime Mob', 'Alexyss K.

"Invisible HitsWhen Beck’s “Loser” became an inescapable MTV and radio staple in 1994, the songwriter seemed to have one-hit wonder written all over him. It’s easy to imagine a lesser talent fading away within months, particularly given the alternative-music gold rush of the era. But Beck beat the odds and then some, making innovative and influential music throughout the 1990s and solid, albeit not as exciting music since then., Beck’s third studio album and major-label debut, was released 25 years ago today (March 1), so it’s a good time to dig into the strange, fertile years that preceded Beck’s big breakthrough. His output from 1988 to 1993 demonstrates how, from the very beginning, he was much more than a slacker generation poster child. “I mean, I never had any slack,” he told  around the time when  was blowing up. “I was working a $4-an-hour job trying to stay alive. I mean, that slacker kind of stuff is for people who have the time to be depressed about everything.”The earliest glimpse we have of Beck comes from , a surprisingly assured cassette recorded in 1988, when he was still a teenaged high-school dropout obsessing over folk-blues masters like Mississippi John Hurt. He was already adding his own flavor to the timeworn acoustic vibes of yesteryear, with surrealist talking blues and rambling ballads that reference crack houses, comic books, and flamethrowers—the kind of stuff he would later refine for 1994’s . You could also point to the weirdo recitation of “Olde English” as a messy precursor to the folk/hip-hop fusion of “Loser.” And you might even get a hint of ’s melancholy heartbreak on ’s “Going Nowhere Fast” and the forlorn “Woe” (“I found you, you found me/Together we found misery”). Clearly the pieces of the puzzle were all coming together.After a failed attempt to break into New York City’s so-called “anti-folk” scene in the early ’90s, Beck returned to his L.A. stomping grounds and began performing wherever he could—on city sidewalks, at house parties, and at tiny clubs like Jabberjaw and Troy Café. The latter spot in Little Tokyo was a home away from home in more ways than one: his mother, Bibbe Hansen, was a co-owner. These two clips of Beck at the Troy give a good indication of what his early live show was like: shambolic, dissonant, but oddly endearing. Backed only by a drummer, Beck’s detuned acoustic and mumbly narratives don’t seem like the stuff of major-label A&R dreams, even in a post- landscape. But there’s a clear preview of the crossover to come; one in-the-know fan requests “Loser,” which Beck had recorded in 1991 (or possibly early ’92) but didn’t release until March of ’93.In the meantime, the songs kept on coming. For Beck fans, the early ’90s are a (mellow) gold mine of unreleased demos, cassettes of which began circulating in the L.A. underground. The  tape kicks off with an inspired country-blues cover of GG Allin’s confrontational “Tough Fuckin’ Shit” (“I hate my family/They can all go suck my ass”) and an aggro rendition of Dwarves’ “Fuck You Up & Get High” before cruising into twisted spoken-word rambles (“Satan Was Way Cool”) and more straightforward gospel-tinged efforts (“That Highway Won’t Get You to Heaven”). “Loser” itself (under the title “Kill Me”) also makes its unofficial debut here, buried on side two.  also includes an intriguing glimpse of the band Loser, featuring drummer Steve Hanft, who would go on to create several of Beck’s early videos. The group highlights Beck’s heavier side, but it’s unlikely he was taking it  seriously—“Trash Can” in particular sounds like a withering takedown of grunge.“The only thing I miss about those days is having time,” a wistful Beck told  in 2015. “I had a lot of time to drift in and out of songs. Everything went into them and songs came out of life in a natural way. [T]here was a lot of freedom in a sense. The kind of music that I was doing and that my friends and I liked was invisible at the time. There was nobody watching or caring.” That feeling of freedom comes across loud and clear on further demo tapes that Beck mailed to L.A. radio stations in his early years.  is particularly good, showcasing an increasingly confident songwriter with a unique aesthetic emerging. Some versions of the tape feature the hilarious, future 7-inch “MTV Makes Me Want to Smoke Crack,” which took on an added level of irony when Beck became a mainstay on the channel just a few years later. For further exploration of Beck in lo-fi mode, check out some of the other demos that have circulated among collectors, including  and .“Loser” officially made it out into the world on a 12-inch released by Bong Load Records in the spring of 1993. Despite only 500 copies being pressed, the song’s soaring chorus, rapid-fire stoner lyrics, and infectious slide-guitar hook quickly caught the attention of local radio stations KROQ, KXLU, and KCRW, who all put the song into heavy rotation. Beck made his radio debut that summer on KCRW’s influential  show, freestyling over “Loser”’s backing track, performing solo acoustic, and chatting amiably with host Chris Douridas. The songwriter would soon sign with DGC—the alt-rock equivalent of the major leagues—and begin putting together .

"The band had cited “unbalanced, unfair terms” of contract with Tommy Boy RecordsThe long-awaited arrival of De La Soul’s back catalog on streaming services has been postponed. Label Tommy Boy canceled the release scheduled for last night—celebrating the 30th anniversary of 3 Feet High & Rising—after the band spoke out against the “unbalanced, unfair terms” of its contract,  reports. Pitchfork has contacted Tommy Boy representatives for further comment.In a statement obtained by , Tommy Boy said Thursday, “Because Tommy Boy has not had the opportunity to sit down together with De La Soul and finalise our negotiations—something we’ve wanted to do for months—we have decided to postpone the digital release of their catalogue scheduled for tomorrow.”The rap trio had claimed that it would receive 10 percent of streaming profits, with the rest going to Tommy Boy. The group’s David “Trugoy” Jolicoeur told Rolling Stone that Tommy Boy had agreed to a 70 percent share, but would take an extra 20 percent toward a “phantom debt” the group allegedly owes of $2 million. The group are still trying to determine what the debt is for,  reports.Part of the complication stems from uncleared samples on the band’s debut, . De La Soul said on Instagram that they may be liable to lawsuits if Tommy Boy hasn’t obtained clearance.

Her passion, intricacy, and inviting energy has won over the hearts of listeners all over the globe. This worldly babe has performed in a variety of different countries and appeared on some of the best festival lineups in history.One of her latest live releases is a massive a four-hour set recorded at the infamous biennial BOOM Festival, in Portugal. Throughout this set dela takes us on a tranquil and lucid journey, reaching all your senses and leaving you with a feeling of wholeness. dela Moon surely has a way to light up any dance floor and this set truly made me feel like I was there.Aside from her live performances, she has recently teamed up with Chief Jesta on their latest Radiant Frequencies EP for Street Ritual, adding her known and loved drum and bass influence.

She is the banner woman for drum & bass at the festival, but she'll be flanked by acts like Shield, spacegeishA, Thelem, K.L.O, Kursa, Seppa, VCTRE, and so many more who will not only drop drum and bass, but also its multivariate progeny: halftime, liquid, and the like.

"By: Michelle GarganoWhen you think of Las Vegas several things may come to mind: the infamous Strip, gambling, and 24-hour entertainment. Music is held with the highest regard here, however the EDM scene is predominately flooded with mainstream artists who are hosted in overpriced nightclubs with a dress code. It’s rare that you will find a venue with good sound, great vibes, and out of-the-box artists.But when you pull back the curtains of glitz and glamour and the social stigma attached to the EDM world in Sin City, there you will find a weekly event, Nickel Fucking Beer Night, that has been working hard to forge a pathway for the underground. Held in the comfort of one of the Fremont Street Experience’s most prestigious bars, NFBN has been the host to some of the best and freshest talent in the scene, as well as making a spotlight for new up and coming artists.For the last eight years, every Tuesday NFBN has been showcasing unique talent that you won’t find anywhere else in Las Vegas. During the last year it has received the attention of some of the original dons of the bass realm, creating an environment unlike any other for the locals.I got a chance to catch up with the men responsible for all this magic, Joe Borusiewicz and Lonnie Hill, to find out more about their history, day to day operations, and future plans, and here is what they had to say!What was the original vision for NFBN?Joe: The original NFBN started off very loose, conceptually—we had open format DJ's, punk bands, rap battles, themed parties, all sorts of out-there stuff.  We tried to incorporate a piece of everything we loved about Downtown Las Vegas at the time into what was essentially a weekly backyard kegger you’d invite all your friends to and just go ham.Do you plan to keep NFBN as a weekly event or is there hopes of it becoming a weekend event as well?Joe: Right now we're focused on hosting the best weekly event in Las Vegas. We're always thinking of ways to expand, the table is piled high with ideas, but priority #1 at the moment is cultivating something vibrant and inclusive that serves the people who support it week after week. There's something really different and really exciting about what's happening here and now. New artists, new sounds, new faces in the crowd, and a lot of old friends who've been inspired to start coming around again… let's keep cultivating that and see where it goes.What is your scouting process like and how can artists get involved with NFBN? Lonnie: For local support acts, we scout with our ears. It's really that simple. Social media followers and such are obviously nice things to have, but quality is truly everything to us. Some people make great music, some people have serious DJ skills, and some people just seem to just know when to play the right track. We don't expect perfection, but we expect everyone who plays has put some time into their craft. The days of people who can't DJ or craft a good Ableton/controller set but have 10,000 Twitter followers and are getting the best gigs are over. We're constantly seeking out new local acts and we hope the Las Vegas scene sees this as a place where the best can develop their skills and fine tune how they play to a crowd. If you're a Las Vegas based DJ or producer, and the music you play fits what we're doing, we're always an email away at: nickelfnbeernight@gmail.com. What kind of sound system are you using?Joe: Commonwealth recently installed the only Void Acoustics rig in southern Nevada, it’s been a game changer for us and the depth of programming we can accommodate. One of the barriers to bass music events in general establishing a footing is the lack of intimate venues with proper sound systems. Our front-facing system consists of 4 Staysis Xair dual 18’s with a pair of Void Tri Motions handling the mids and highs.NFBN is giving a whole new meaning to “turning up on Tuesday,” with its roster for 2019. Thus far they fully melted the minds of DTLV with some of The Untz Festival favs. With performances by Bleep Bloop, Ivy Lab, DMVU, Esseks, and Yheti they have created a thriving niche for bassheads. They are just about to kick off “HELLA BASS” for the month of April with some truly noteworthy artists: Caspa, CharlestheFirst, Bukez Finezt, The Widdler, and Pigeon Hole. Check out the stellar lineup at Nickel Fucking Beer Night for your bass fix and a truly one-of-a-kind Las Vegas music experience.By using their passion and knowledge of music and their love for production NFBN has managed to create something that generations to come will hear stories about. It is taking the history and culture of the original Vegas image and combining it with the community that gets overlooked in such a flashy city, and it really is a beautiful thing.",articles15,"['Experience’s', 'Tuesday', 'Staysis Xair', 'Tuesday', 'Bleep Bloop', 'Ivy Lab', 'DMVU', 'Esseks', 'Bukez Finezt', 'The Widdler']"
"By: Anand HarshVALE is becoming the go-to label for experimental bass music that still contains the slickness of pop production. There's plenty of grit and grime in the nascent label's catalog, but the artwork, branding, and overall approach by the reinvented IDM outlet is wildly on-point.Which brings us to the label's new compilation series, AXON. Volume I rockets us into a Blade Runner dystopian metropolis complete with a seizure-inducing video (that's a compliment to its creator, Ash Cox), and jaw-dropping artwork by ALTITXDE that features be-helmeted avatars of each of the comp's contributors.Two of those contributors include Boston's DeeZ and Smigonaut. Many eyebrows were raised when we premiered the DeeZNauts brand back in October with the duo's collab “Escape Pod,” which became one of the most exciting tracks we shared last fall. Demand for another collaboration was high, and Andrew Widdecomb and Joshua Kipersztok delivered.Today we premiere “Future Execute,” stylistically attempting to predict the future of club music with a blend of neuro and industrial elements. Both of these acts are known sound design wizards, but have undergone so much evolution over the past couple of years that it is truly exciting to watch.Featuring others like Poseidon, ÆTERNA, and Uprising, the latest compilation, AXON Vol I is available for pre-order now ahead of its April 2 release.",articles15,"['Today', 'ÆTERNA']"
"By: Anand HarshWakaan fans rejoice! One of the favorite sons of Liquid Stranger's label, LUZCID, strikes out with a brand new EP, today.

It's a much cleaner version of that big, boisterous UK sound that drifted across the pond from the Flux's and the Doctor P's and CASPA's of the low end world.Today we highlight, “Soundblaster,” which leans in more on LUZCID's penchant for melodic bass elements, but he certainly doesn't skimp on those low end blasters.Fans can catch him tonight in Grand Rapids at The Intersection with Zomboy as part of the ROTT N ROLL tour, and then tomorrow night he joins his Wakaan crew at the completely sold out Joy Theater in New Orleans for the late night Buku takeover.smarturl.it/luzcidprophecy",articles15,"['Martin Stääf', 'Intersection', 'Zomboy']"

"By: Anand HarshA 40oz Collective has been bottling and repackaging the hottest bass talent in the country from its Florida outpost, and today piledrives the scene with some major names that are playing The Untz Festival this summer.VCTRE, tiedye ky, and G-Space are among the contenders who have entered the ring on Top Rope, a raucous comp that took some wild Duke Blazer samples and a penchant for wrasslin' and whipped into into a neck-breaking cage match of epic proportions. Past festival performers EAZYBAKED, Cut Rugs and Kirby Bright also make the compilation, as well as NEWSENSEi and HUMORME.As Duke Blazer explains it:HITTING EM FROM THE TOP ROPE means to climb up to your challenges/conflicts/difficulties you face in life and jump at them head on from 10 feet in the air with a MIGHTY ELBOW DROP!!!! inspired by the energy and feeling wrestling created for me growing up as a child, hitting em from the TOP ROPE is relentlessly taking down whatever stands in the way of your goals, and doing so with DRIPPING IN SWAG!Name Your Price",articles15,"['VCTRE', 'G-Space', 'Duke Blazer', 'EAZYBAKED', 'Kirby Bright', '!!!!', 'DRIPPING']"

The lead offer, title track “Epiphany,” will ramp up revenue and decrease overhead (mainly due to levitating listeners closer to the ceiling).By integrating the artistry of one Jay Sween, the team at Kozmo Sound Innovations has ensured that productivity will increase 500% in the ogling over art department.Bass a la Mode will be the delivery device for this new Kozmo-branded confection. Tracking the fashion-forward sounds and bass-influenced modernity quotients, KSI is splitting its stock and doubling down on this new venture.Pre-order the EP, Epiphany, now, before Wall Street finds out.",articles15,[]
"By: Jonathan GrossSometimes it feels like producers are unabashedly ripping each other off and the ""sameness"" of releases tends to get us down. But on some rare, shining occasions, we stumble across something so delightfully original, that we spend hours trying to categorize what we're hearing, and still end up no closer to agreeing on a genre than when we started.We love that shit.Back in late 2017, Mr Jennings dropped a Wormfile, “Bounce Museum” on our partner outlet, Wormhole Music Group. The east coast bass act then linked up with fellow east coast artist, illexxandra, for a split EP, The Lexicon. The four-track EP is slated for an April 2 release, and features two collabs from the pair, as well as a Mr Jennings remix for illexxandra.It's the reverse remix that we're premiering today, because it is so wildly unique that we need to crowdsource some sort of genrification here, because we have no idea she did with “Bounce Museum.”If it has to be described, it's somewhere in the realm of an electro-swing tune, if instead of old-timey swing and jazz and blues, the source material was 60s Hollywood blockbuster scores. It's as though illexxandra is channeling the type of movie that Mike Myers was spoofing with his Austin Powers films. Imagine beaches and go-go dancers and technicolor lights. It's something that has to be heard to be believed.Mr Jennings is playing east coast's only pre-party for The Untz Festival on March 28th in Richmond, Virginia at Champion Brewing alongside Secret Recipe (of the aforementioned Wormhole team), and be.in of the Ebisu Sound and The Gradient Perspective crew. That pre-party is a co-production of Ebisu and Home Bass. You can catch illexxandra on March 22nd in Brooklyn and March 30 in Chicago. Most importantly, you're going to want to check out the rest of this EP, because it's a damn delight.Download illexandra's “Bounce Museum” remix today.",articles15,"['Mike Myers', 'Recipe']"
"By: Anand HarshDue in large part to the overwhelming positivity that flowed from last year's event, seminal live electronic hybrid STS9 is coming back to Belden Town, California for Wave Spell Live.The legendary band will be performing 9 sets, 3 of which will be special improvised Wave Spell sets, much like last year. The supporting cast of characters is much different though in the second year with iconic jamtronica act The New Deal joing the fun along with Mark Farina, Christian Martin, Thriftworks, Random Rab, SoDown, Russ Liquid, Bluetech, and returning modular synth champion Richard Devine, who absolutely stunned crowds by joining Tribe during one of their sets.The band also welcomes an insurgence of house and techno lovers with three members of the Desert Hearts crew, and our Wormhole homies will be holding down some beach takeover sets.The VIP Stage lineup is TBA, but there are so many cool amenities, art installations, workshops, and more.

"By: Anand HarshIn all the hubub surrounding our Phase 2 lineup for The Untz Festival, our more discerning fans caught hold of a special set that was slipped in amongst the rest and got themselves all in a tizzy. What was this Mike Wallis downtempo set?Wallis, the co-founder of left-field label, Colony Productions, half of Crunch with Dave Tipper, and one-third of K.L.O with Kursa and Lone Drum (he's the ""O"") is performing a special downtempo set for us? This sent a certain type of bass nerd (really, our entire fan base) down a rabbit hole of possibilities. Most exciting of all is that the first solo Osmetic release would be timed perfectly for this spring in the lead up to our festival.Lab Notes is out tomorrow (March 15) on Colony Productions. The four-track EP features downtempo and ambient musings unlike much material fans of Wallis' other projects might be familiar. That being said, the intense attention to detail and flair for the subtle is enhanced under further examination, and all the hallmarks of his penchant for bass-focused production are there—just viewed through a different lens. Mike Wallis will always dazzle, but he doesn't need to hit you over the head with it.Today we premiere “Simples,” a delighful sketch of sonic wit and wonder that tickles the seasoned fan and entrances newcomers to his sound. All of Mike Wallis' myriad projects demands some contextualization, which is why I was thrilled that he agreed to answer a few questions for our fans.Osmetic - Lab Notes by colony productionsCan you tell our fans a bit about this release and how it might differ from K.L.O material, and even prior Osmetic releases?This is the first solo release using the Osmetic name, it's a more downtempo affair than the K.L.O output that's for sure. I do have a track coming out on a Street Ritual comp under the Osmetic moniker later this year, though, which I have been dropping in a few of the K.L.O sets recently..Can fans expect to hear Lab Notes and songs of their ilk during the Mike Wallis downtempo set at The Untz Festival?Absolutely, that's the vibe I'll be going for... Really looking forward to that set!Lab Notes is coming out on Colony Productions, can you give us the quick and dirty on the history of your label, and maybe some recent and upcoming releases that are germane to our fans?Colony was established in 2001, we've had artists from around the globe feature on the label over the years. Sam Ashwell and I run the label together these days, Sam is one half of Vent and Abstrakt Knights too. I would say the artists that people may recognise include Crunch, Vent, Opiuo, Kursa, Bogtrotter, Dream Walker, Tryptich, Mouldy Soul but there are many more too. Check it out hopefully you'll find something you like.Are there any particular artists we should be keeping an eye on who you see changing the bass game these days?Slug Wife crew for sure, Tipper always, I think Base2 is gonna blow up. There's a lot of good music out there at the moment if you have the time to find it.Our fans would run us out of town if we didn't ask (even though you likely can't answer the question): Does the future hold any Crunch sets or even studio releases?Your guess is as good as mine...Got any K.L.O surprises you're sitting on for The Untz Festival that you can tease for us?You'll have to wait and see but I can say we're super stoked to be throwing down for you guys!***Pre-order Lab Notes now before it comes out tomorrow",articles15,"['Crunch', 'Kursa', 'Lone Drum', 'Today', 'Sam Ashwell', 'Abstrakt Knights', 'Crunch', 'Bogtrotter', 'Dream Walker', 'Tryptich', 'Crunch']"

"By: Jonathan GrossA three-headed monster from North Carolina is about to wreak havoc on the deep dubstep world. At the convergence of minimal dub and psychedelic bass rises “Conscious,” the triple collab from Pathwey, Murkury, and Grime Theory.These three bass masters have just turned in a gorgeous assemblage of low end wubs and brilliant, subtle percussion. It's not too heavy, not too trippy, and not too slow. It's the Goldilocks of deep dub. Pathwey is beloved in the Shanti Planti and Merkaba Music world. Murkury has been leaning more into the dubstep world, and Grime Theory has been going the opposite way and leaning into the psybass sound. The combination of these three is utterly magical, though.Pathwey just played a big psychedelic bash in Boston with the Grouch in Dub live band. Murkury plays Portland, Oregon tomorrow night (March 20) and then Eternal Elements in Los Angeles, California this Saturday, March 23. Grime Theory heads to Chicago, Illinois for Rated Deep with Bloodline and Distinct Motive on March 29.",articles15,"['Goldilocks', 'Bloodline', 'Distinct Motive']"

A day ahead of the release, we're happy to premiere, “Kintsugi,” which gives me serious flashbacks to earlier work of another Northern California favorite of ours, Shlump. The hard-hitting drums and the clean bass lines are very reminiscent of Michael Petzel's sound, but that's not to say that Malakai Torres hasn't assembled it all in his own unique way.Just yesterday it was announced that Edekit will be joining his Wormhole bretheren at Stilldream Festival in Wilseyville, California in late June, so expect his set to be packed because fans far and wide are going to be intrigued by Ambiguity.",articles15,"['Edekit', 'Torres', 'Tomorrow', 'Shlump', 'Edekit']"
"Editor's Note:The Wobble Women series is back with more incredible women kicking ass behind the scenes in the bass music industry. If you have a suggestion of who we should profile next, please drop us a line at support@theuntz.com or post them up in The Untztoppable Facebook group.By: Heather HodderAlly Grimm better known by her moniker, A.L. Grime, is not your average 27-year-old boss babe. Born in Venezuala and raised in D.C., She is the co-founder, creative director, and an agent at The Gradient Perspective and its flagship record label. Additionally, Grimm is booking manager for Thought Process and Scarien, and live art coordinator for BADVSS Entertainment and the Bass Network. If that wasn’t enough, Grimm actively pursues a lively visionary art and music career as A.L. Grime. Grimm is on her way to be a multimedia mogul—an obvious choice to be a role model to younger and older women alike.Grimm is very involved in the local arts scene in her new home base of Denver, Colorado. As she explains, “I'm working on a mural at The Black Box in Denver, I was just added as an art coordinator for Solasta Festival, I’m launching my first clothing line this Fall, and I’m launching a radio show at the end of this month with some friends.” These hints have us salivating.Grimm “paid her dues” when she first broke into the music business, taking an unglamorous role running the box office and a promotions team for a small venue in West Virginia.Grimm’s tough female boss from this small venue gave her great advice, “When you have a Rolodex of haters, just know you’re doing it right.”“This has been my mantra since that day,” Grimm said, “Anytime I feel disrespected or undervalued because of my gender, I remember my own strength. Anytime I feel sexualized by people that I work with, I remember my value. And anytime someone second guesses me in a project, I keep my head down and kick some serious ass. We are our own best cheerleaders. And anyone who isn’t cheering for you, is only proof that you’re doing something they wish they could do.”Additionally Grimm went through her own personal darkness and struggle that led to her career now.“When I first started painting two-and-a-half years ago,” Grimm explained, “I was in one of the darkest times in my life. I had dropped out of school, freshly completed a detox/mental health stay in a hospital, and was realizing that I had pretty much no one standing behind me to support me. Incredibly defeated and feeling hopeless and lost, I turned to a canvas and released years of pent up negative energy in one sitting. When I look back on everything I have been able to do in the last two-and-a-half years, I am overcome with awe and filled with a hunger for more. The girl that sat in front of that first canvas didn’t believe in herself. That girl didn’t have a dream or goals because honestly that girl didn’t feel she had a lot to live for.”From time to time even such an accomplished woman like Grimm has self doubt, which I think we all can relate to, whatever stage of life we’re in. Grimm says, “Now, in my darkest moments, I catch myself talking to that girl often. I still have a voice in the back of my mind that tells me that I’m not good enough, or strong enough, or cool enough to succeed. But now, I have two-and-a-half years of experiences that prove that voice wrong and that serve as reminders for what you can achieve if you just keep pushing. The thought of my potential success and the potential growth of this community is what gets me out of bed every day and helps me crush through resistance.”Some of A.L. Grime’s most memorable moments include getting to create two murals at Art Basel right in Wynwood this past December, running the first full The Gradient Perspective stage with over 60 musicians, an art gallery, mural maze, and a full lineup of workshops, becoming a member of the Bass Network team as the Art Coordinator and assisting with special ops during events, being featured as the very first Artist of the Month in Tipper Art led by Liza Schultz, and having her first solo art show in female owned and operated Spectra Art Space.“My biggest piece of advice, although I usually say this to people privately, don’t sell yourself short in your climb,” explained Grimm, adding,” While I celebrate self expression, I see way too many girls who feel pressured to use their sexuality to climb without realizing how it is hurting them—personally and professionally.”In 2019 Grimm says that women don’t need a man to get to the top of her career, “We have moved beyond an era where women are forced to be used as objects. Use your mind and your talents to rise to the top because they are what make you authentic, unique, and powerful.”Grimm is “incredibly inspired by music, which is why I have chosen to pursue a position in the industry alongside my art career. I am moved by sounds that can pull emotions out of me that I didn’t even know were there. I tend to like more chill sounds to create and work to like CharlestheFirst, Koan Sound, Asa, Thought Process, and, my favorite, the entire Soulection collection.”Grimm’s favorite place to paint is at home, adding “I am a serious homebody and I have a ritual that I perform to get my head in the game so I do my best when I am able to create my perfect sanctuary before getting creative.”Women who inspire Grimm include Ke$ha, Nicole Cacciavilliano from Sub.Mission, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Beat Kitty, Clozee, ill.Esha, Missy Elliott, Cardi B, Lillipore, Khiva, Sade, Aaliyah, Hannah Faith, Hannah Yata, Amanda Sage, and so many more.More she advice from A.L. Grime: “Join women’s collectives and creative clubs! Surrounding yourself with empowered feminine energy will help you become confident and feel like the goddess you truly are! Read the book The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. It will change your life.”Grimm has many upcoming projects. Through The Gradient Perspective, “we have so many incredible things coming up on our agenda. We will be hosting the workshops at The Untz Festival this summer and a main stage takeover with some of our brightest musicians. We will also be hosting a stage at Big Dub Festival again this year as well as some more takeovers at some festivals we can’t name just yet. I will also be launching a new radio show project with some very talented partners in the coming months which will tease some of my long term projects for TGP. We will also be taking part in tons of events around the country showcasing art, music, and education,” said Grimm.Additionally, “On a personal level, I will be taking on a couple of larger mural projects this spring which I can’t name just yet. I will be leading the Live Artists at the Bassnectar events all year as well as at Big Dub Festival and a couple other major events as well. I look forward to working with the two musicians I manage as well (Thought Process and Scarien) to help them grow and to get their message heard from coast to coast,” Grimm added.One last piece of advice: “I once opened a fortune cookie that read, “Life is not a Struggle. It’s a Wiggle.” When things look dark, remember that you can’t be stopped if you just keep moving,” exclaimed Grimm.More inspirational food for thought from Grimm? Look no further:“One of the things that I think discourages a lot of women from entering the business is that they feel helpless against the masculine machine of the entertainment industry. I feel this really often, and it is a feeling that I have to remind myself not to overpower me.” “It can be really confusing being in this industry sometimes. As a woman you can't be too loud or you're a bitch, too quiet or you're weak. You can't dress provocatively or you're easy but you also can't look sloppy or a lot of males in the industry won't take you seriously. You have to be polite without stepping over the very fine line that could be confused for flirting and if you do flirt but don't follow through with more you get blacklisted for being a tease. It can often feel like we can't win and to many girls that can be too overwhelming to step into the industry. It can be even works for survivors of abuse and assault. They are facing triggers at every turn but have to remain silent for fear of coming across as damaged or weak.”  Grimm said, “In moments where we feel like we can't fight the system, it is important that we turn to each other to create a system of love, respect, and support so that we can rise up into roles that allow us to bring real change to the scene as a whole. Show love to the other women our here on their grind. Connect with them, share your experiences and your dreams with them. Look to your sisters in sound. We can bring a positive change to this scene by standing strong together, individually pushing our unique artistic visions, and uniting in the pursuit of building a positive, sustainable music community.”",articles15,"['The Black Box', 'I’m', 'Liza Schultz', '“My', 'Nicole Cacciavilliano', 'Beat Kitty', 'Missy Elliott', 'Cardi B', 'Hannah Faith', 'Amanda Sage', '!

"By: Anand HarshLeave it to Berklee School of Music grads to leave my menial music theory understanding in the dust.Boston's TAHABDRA are reimagining drum & bass in a furiously unique way. Breaking electronic music production all the way down to its essential elements—all the way down to the tuning, makes you wonder what else drummer/producer Josh Weinberg and DJ/producer Wiggz Caro can do.Best to let them put it in their own words:TRIPTYCH is a three fold voyage through the ferocious and chaotic. Fusing digital with organic elements along with the unique tuning system combining the biological resonant frequency 528Hz, the golden ratio, and Fibonacci sequence to provide a juxtaposition between light and darkness. Three distinct yet intertwined stories asking you to rip apart the fabric of what you know as reality and pave your own path.Weinberg and Caro today premiere “IBOGA,” one of three tunes from the TRIPTYCH EP, and make drum and bass boldly their own with unexpected patterns and an industrial edge. These two impress, and it's not just their pedigree, being able to bridge esoteric production with music that makes people actually move is a gift.",articles15,"['TRIPTYCH', 'Weinberg']"
"Over five years in the waiting…Skrillex and Boys Noize have just dropped Turn Off The Lights, their first Dog Blood tune since 2013’s Middle Finger Part 2. A heady fusion of house, breaks, techno and rave, it’s dripping in the duo’s signature rave fusion and it goes like this…The news was teased by Skrillex earlier this week on Twitter. He not only announced that their set tonight at Ultra Music Festival will be streamed live but that at least two more tracks will follow soon…Bloody brilliant. Tune into Ultra Live tonight at 12.30 eastern time (4.30am UK time) for a chance to hear the new Dog Blood bangers and plenty more. Throw your middle finger if you feel them yo.

" They have only ever played one B2B together before in their careers…EDC’s full line-up was announced yesterday, March 27. As always with the Las Vegas megafestival low-end representation is prominent on all three days between May 17-19 (thank you Bassrush) but it’s the Friday that’s got everybody talking as Skream will play one of his rare old school dubstep sets… And he’ll be doing so with the one and only Rusko.“I’ll be playing Skream records from 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007,” states Skream in an interview he and Rusko did with Mixmag earlier this week. “When I say it out loud, it doesn’t make any sense to me, but what I’m forgetting is the kids who are 18, 19, 20 and 21… they were in fucking kindergarten in 2005! I declared I was never going to do it again because I’m only about moving forward, but I love the music I’ve made years ago. And I still do. So it’s like, fuck it, whatever. Let’s have a huge party.”“I literally did NOT think Skream was gonna be up for this,” adds Rusko. “It was the longest shot of longest shots as it’s well known he hadn’t played a dubstep set for years. Stylistically though, his classic output and mine – like a glove mate. It’s gonna be seamless.”The full interview is a reavealing read as Skream explains how their only previous B2B ended up with him “getting loose” and going AWOL after 10 minutes. He also shares some fantastic points about how dubstep never lost its soul or died but simply went back underground. Rusko, meanwhile, addresses the reputation both acts have had over the years as bon viveurs who have enjoyed dance music’s extra curricular activities a little too much and promises there’s going to be a method to their old school madness.“We actually have a couple of days set aside purely to create a game plan and rehearse as we are both known for err… sometimes focusing on parting rather than mixing,” he states. “It’s, of course, going to be everything you expect – a comprehensive history lesson of classic dubstep delivered pretty sloppily with much excitement and movement. Party time!”Party time indeed. Skream and Rusko aren’t the only interesting b2b on the opening night of EDC. Danny Byrd and Rene LaVice and Friction and Metrik will also be going toe to toe on the Basspod. They’ll be joined by the likes of Andy C, Ganja White Night, Funtcase, Joyryde, The Glitch Mob and so many more acts. And that’s the just the Friday.

"Pelikann, Negativ, Barely Royal, Mofaux, Spekktrum, Archive, Freddie Martin… The list of new generation artists to come through Reading based brand Saucy Music reads like a who’s who in UK bass right now.Forward thinking, never typical but always slamming, always evolving; the label have been relentless in their release onslaught since they launched in November 2014. Less than five years later they’ve launched their own management/artist collective and, just last week, hit their milestone 100th release.A one track headshot from Barely Royal, Pelikann, Affiliate, Licked! (AKA label owners Marc Ballum and Sam Gibbons pictured above) and MC Purple Velvet Curtains, The Machine comprises all the shades of filth we’ve come to expect from Saucy; gargantuan weight, a fusion of broken beats and a happy slappy 4×4 bassline groove and a reese bass that’s so dank it could melt concrete.A strictly family affair originally made as an intro for their legendary Boomtown set last year, it captures the label’s energy, darkness and sense of fun. It also sets them up for another relentless sea of gully for the next 100 releases. We called up Marc and Sam to catch the label story so far…100th release!Marc: I won’t lie, it’s been a bit of a slog getting there.Releases have been relentless since 2014. You guys haven’t stopped. But let’s go further back for a second and see what actually triggered Saucy in the first place…Marc: I started the brand on my own to begin with. I loved DJing and would throw nights around the Reading area with a couple of mates and a crew called Fusion. That died down, they were all older and grew up. I needed to either give it up or take it a lot more seriously so I thought I’d go for it. I was into early My Nu Leng and a lot of that gritty bassy stuff that was happening around the time and wanted to get more of it out there. I got stuck in and took it from there.You weren’t producing?Marc: I dabbled a bit, and still do, but I felt more comfortable as a DJ and found my skills were best placed as a label owner. So yeah around 2014 I was throwing a drum & bass night called Pure FX, we had our own rig and take it to a dingy pub and drop filthy drum & bass. Sam was down there one night, we got chatting and a week later he was on the team.Sam: I had no idea what that night would lead to. I was just out for a few drinks. At the time I was studying music business and I’ve personally come through songwriting. I was in metal bands when I was younger then got converted to bass music with the whole Skrillex era and moved into more 4×4 bass stuff. We realised we loved the same style and were heading in the same direction and we got to work.Marc: We clicked straight away and were on the same wavelength, you don’t get that with people very often in life do you? So we soon became business partners and split everything down the middle.What was the time frame between you meeting and that first release in November 2014?Sam: It was already two releases deep by the time I came around. Saucy Selections Volume 1 was out when I came along.That album was a big statement. Saucy’s second release and it was a big V/A album full of people have since gone onto big things.Marc: I appreciate that. Every Saucy Selection release has done incredibly well actually We’re changing the concept of that series now and developing other ideas. We’re constantly trying to step up and push forward and try new things every year.Never rest on your laurels or stagnate!Sam: That’s it. We’re always looking at what we can do better or keep fresh. You have to do it, or you’ll get left behind.Give me some Saucy level up moments…Marc: Boomtown last year was monumental. Just absolutely nuts. Our first UKF upload Negativ’s Infinite was a major moment too.Sam: That kicked off on YouTube too because it was used by Faze Clan. That was pretty mental.  think another level up has been setting up the management thing with acts like Pelikann, Barely Royal, Affiliate and things like that. Getting involved in their story has been a turning point, developing things and helping them as artists and setting things up.Marc: We’d been building the whole family vibe from the start, so it just felt natural to do it and take a step further. I’m really proud of everyone in our team and what everyone does but recently it’s been very exciting and fulfilling to see Pelikann, who’s been with us since the start, getting signed to Circus and taking off. I’m exciting to see that happening with a lot of our artists.Pelikann sums up the label’s broad melting pot sound. You never know what you’re going to get, beside it being pure filth of some description. You keep us on our toes.Marc: That’s it mate, that’s exactly what we go for and we have a wide range of tastes. I come from much more filthy sounds in any genre.Sam: And I come from more of a bass house and tech house stomping ground and I guess we’ve merged the style quite well.Back to the 100th release. This began in Boomtown last year, right?Marc: Yeah we all wrote it for our intro track. We had a little vocal sample over it and goes into those reeses. It just kicked off and people were asking about it straight away. It’s had mad support with guys like Skepsis playing heavily since last year. It’s been quality seeing people go crazy to it.Those reeses remind of early old school breaks. 2000s era.Sam: That’s the vibe we were going for. Barely Royal did that part and he’s really inspired by drum & bass and wanted something epic so it came about that way.So the track really is that family vibe of all of you getting stuck in…Marc: Yeah man that’s what we’re all about; we want to keep it tight and have a unit and support each other. So everyone on the track is managed by us. It’s a wicked feeling to have done this and for it to be our 100th release.What comes next though?Sam: We’ve got an EP from NuBass which is just stupidly good. That’s on the first of April. Then after that we’ve got a treat from Pelikann, bits from Barely Royal with a remix EP the some bits from a guy called Castnowski from Canada who’s sent us this sick collaboration with Flatmate. And that’s just the start of it. We’ve got loads of bits after that but we can’t give too much away for now…Marc: Projects with new artists, a new series to introduce and new concepts. There’s loads going on mate.

"No more trawling through garage/bassline/grime, future house, breaks, electrohouse and dubstep categories to find your favourite chunky, chop-slapping bass house grooves on Beatport: As of yesterday, Thursday March 21, they’ve added a new dedicated bass house genre category.It’s been a long time coming; the term bass house has been bubbling away since 2015 when acts ranging from Valentino Khan to AC Slater began to really cut through the EDM noise with a sound and energy that was characterised by bass but didn’t quite fit into any established genre.We documented the development of the sound at the time, tracing bass house roots back to 2000s fidget and its foundation in late 90s speed garage and breaks; like any proper genre that’s here for the long haul and has staying power, bass house comes with a rich history of styles, influences and innovators.And it’s now 100 times easier to find and support on Beatport thanks to its dedicated genre category. “It’s exciting,” says Malaa (who appears to be the first number one in category since it launched with his Addiction track) “It’s the recognition of a new sound, representing an evolution in electronic music.”AC Slater, perhaps one of the most prominent and influential voices in bass house agrees (to the point he and his label have created their own sound and movement within the genre) agrees. “Bass House is a very useful sub-genre for browsing on Beatport. It fills in all the gaps between garage/bassline and future house/electro.”Fill in your own gaps and explore the bass house category yourself. And while you’re there, see if you can help Kings Of The Rollers to ‘do a Benny L’ get their stinking You Got Me to the number one of the overall charts… It’s been sitting at (still very impressive) number two all week!

"While Hospital have been roadblocking the headlines with benchmark setting Beatport number ones and massive albums from the likes of S.P.Y and Kings Of The Rollers, their Med School imprint has been equally busy making serious manoeuvres…Following Whiney’s absolute killer album Waystone in late 2018, they’ve dropped a crucial fusion EP from the inimitable A.Fruit, equally essential Whiney remixes by Lakeway and Toronto’s Polaris who, we can confirm, has officially joined the label.His arrival follows a whole string of cameos on both Med School and Hospital that date back to 2016’s Future Sound Of Canada. Since then he’s been casually dropping his signature atmospheric sounds on a whole host of V/A albums on both labels including Forza Horizon 4, both 2018 and 2019 editions of the Sick Music series and 2017’s Hospitality In The Park compendium… All of which builds up to his official debut EP in May.Famously being called out by the label boss Tony Colman on the Hospital podcast for not being prolific enough, Polaris (real name Vlad) is now sitting on a whole stack of newness and it’s about to start flowing out very soon. We called him up to see where he’s at…You’re based in Toronto… There’s some proper jungle heritage in that city!There is man. It has deep roots here since the very start. I think at one point in time it was one of the most popular spots for jungle outside the UK. We used to have this party called Electric Circus which was heavily jungle focused and it would be broadcast on national TV. I’ve seen clips. I wish I was there but I was too young and wasn’t even living in the country at the time.You came over from Romania, right?I did. We came over in 1999. The 90s in Romania was a hard time, there was a lot of turmoil, there were leadership changes and the eventual revolution happened. My parents worked very hard and saved up for us to move to a more stable country. I think the plan was to move to the US but we somehow ended up here. I’m glad we did.And now you’ve ended up on Medschool… I think this has been bubbling behind the scenes for a while, right?Yeah they offered me a deal in early 2018 and I had some tunes finished and a few older tunes, but they weren’t my current style so we started fresh and I started writing a whole new batch again. Tony [London Elektricity] said on a podcast that I’m not the most prolific of artists and he’s right. They had to kick my ass into shape. I wasn’t producing fast enough.Too detail obsessed and overthinking each track?Pretty much. It’s a trait I inherit from my mother. I’ve spent huge amounts of time perfecting my drums and obsessing over making things sound as good as I possibly can.Quality over quantity!Absolutely but I was focusing on it too much and the compositional side suffered, I wasn’t writing, I wasn’t composing, I was fussing over details. So I had to sit down and have a long talk with myself and get back to writing. This was last summer and I was going through some life changes that inspired and motivated me to write so it was perfect timing.So all this goes back to the Future Sound Of Canada EP, right?Yeah I guess. I did some stuff with Schematic which we released on Technique, which was amazing because before then I didn’t really have anything on really significant labels. Then Hospital approached me about the Future Sound EP, which we did. Then a whole bunch of tracks landed on compilations like the recent Forza one. And now there’ll be a release in May. My debut EP.Sick. I have to say Alignment on Sick Music has been my favourite of yours so far…Thanks man. That’s a very different track to what I used to make. I actually started it two years ago before any of these releases started happening. It sounded unlike the version you hear today. I went back in on it and I remember liking the bassline and that was pretty much it so I scrapped the rest of the track and kept that. That was a turning point for me; I’d found a grittier, angrier sound that’s a development from the deeper, more liquid sound I’ve become known for.Are you incorporating more of that into your new stuff?Yeah of course, I never want to be stagnant. Evolution is so important for any artist. I want to continue incorporating new ideas and experimenting with new things all the time but finding balance for that fusion can be a challenge; balancing light and dark isn’t easy and I’ve discovered it’s a case of constant refinement. I think my earlier songs were way too busy. I had way too many things going in there so I’m learning to pick my favourite elements in a track and making sure there’s nothing in the mix to take the attention away from them.Nice. I went back to your earliest tracks, the Bright Eyes EP from 2012. When was the last time you went back over your old stuff?Oh not long ago at all! Last week in fact. I needed to send over all my pages and artist accounts to everything to Hospital. It’s strange to listen to them, it’s like night and day in contrast.Where you in life back then?I was getting deeper and deeper into my love for electronic music I guess. I was into various kinds of electronic music, especially trance, for a few years but then I went to this party called Freak Out where I heard drum & bass for the first time and fell in love with it. From that moment on I saved up a whole bunch of money for my first Macbook because I wanted to start writing drum & bass. Unfortunately it got stolen a month after I bought it.No way man!Luckily my mum lent me hers for a while and that’s when I started to make drum & bass. Or try to make it, I should say. It was on Garageband.That first EP of yours was on Garageband!?Oh no, I’d moved onto Fl Studio by then. But I have to say I was actually experimenting with trance for years before on my old PC. Like I said, I was heavily intro trance all through school; hard trance, progressive trance, I just loved that synthy sound. So I was making that long before I even knew drum & bass existed on Cubase.You were in a band around this time, right? Black Road Blue Skies… Perfect teenage band name!Ha! We were driving to the studio one day and the sky was so blue and road was so black, it just made sense. I was actually in a few bands throughout high school. I was in a death metal band, I was in this band and another band with me and my friend just playing keyboard. But Black Road Blue Skies took off the most mainly down to the drummer who was very connected and got us quite a few gigs in the Ontario area. That’s how I started getting used to play to audiences. It became pretty serious so I put a lot of time and energy into the band and ended up flunking so badly I had to repeat a year.Classic. Sounds like you’ve always had very eclectic tastes, no allegiance to one genre…Absolutely, the one exception is drum & bass. That’s been my foremost obsession since I first heard it.So are you becoming more prolific now things are heating up a bit?Yeah I guess I am. I have a remix of Keeno & Whiney’s Spheres coming very soon and I’m already working on new music and I’m working on a remix for Etherwood, too. I’m just writing a lot more in general so yeah you’re totally right, I’m writing with more focus because it’s becoming a tangible thing.When you see the results it gives you a kick up the arse!It totally does man and that’s a positive influence on everything I do in life.What else inspires you in life?I’ve always loved motorbikes since I was a kid and got one last year. It’s very inspiring to have that freedom to go wherever you want whenever you want and being out in the elements. I’ve found myself riding home from a trip up north where it’s nothing but trees and no one for miles and I find myself humming ideas and tunes that come to me. That’s how most my ideas come about; I’ll wake up with a line in my head and I’ll have to get it down straight away or put it down on my voice recorder before I forget it. That’s how most my ideas come to me.Oh cool, you’re one of those blessed artists who pretty much dreams up tunes?Haha, it’s happened. It’s mostly ambient stuff; sounds and chords progressions but yeah it’s exciting. I know ideas don’t come to everyone as easily so I feel very lucky to have that. Whether it’s aliens breathing ideas into my head or what I don’t know!Whatever it is, long may it continue…Totally man. I don’t want it to stop!Polaris’s remix of Keeno & Whiney – Spheres is out now.

"It’s finally landed: Matrix & Futurebound’s long awaited second album Mystery Machine will drop April 12 as a joint release between both acts’ labels Metro and Viper Recordings.17 tracks deep – including their remix of Emili Sande and established bangers such as Got You There Control, Live Another Day, Happy Alone, Human, Tardis and of course Mystery Machine – the album arrives 12 years after their landmark debut album Universal Truth.Not only plotting their trajectory as one of drum & bass’s most consistent and high profile producer / DJ duos, the album balances the classic introspective sci-fi style instrumental sounds they first forged their partnership around (with tracks such as the album title track, Ear Drum and Let It Go) with their dominant vocal, hooky signature and also occasional excursions into different tempos. As a result Mystery Machine neatly documents their continued mission to fuse club focused studiocraft with traditional songwriting, a skill that’s landed them in the UK top 40 on four occasions.“The battle with electronic music is how to take something that is artificial and give it a soul and an emotional force,” they explain. “That’s why we called our album Mystery Machine. We take the clinical power of studio technology and combine it with our human imaginations. One cannot work without the other. That combination is where our music comes from. THAT is the mystery machine.”Matrix & Futurebound will be celebrating the album release throughout the summer with a packed festival schedule and the launch of a series of events at XOYO. The first kicks off on Sunday May 26 with Calyx & Teebee, Tantrum Desire and Insomniax.But first the album. Mystery Machine is parked up and ready to hit the road April 12. The guys have plotted just some of the scenic locations their machine will take us to en route. Ready to take a ride?“This is the title track of our album. A lot of people know us for our vocal records but this is the other side of what we’re about. It’s always been important to us as producers and as DJs to represent a broad spectrum of this music, even more so when we’re making an album. If you want to dig a little deeper into our sound, this is a good place to start.” “Drum & Bass is often very complicated but sometimes it’s best to keep things simple and let the vocal shine. That’s easier to do when you have a singer like Zelah who absolutely smashed it here. We wrote it in the studio with Becky Hill who we’ve always wanted to work with. She’s just one of those people who was born with the gift of writing great songs.” “Our new single coming with the album! On this track, we stepped out of the Drum & Bass comfort zone but it’s important to have a sonic finger print to your production and this still feels to us like a part of the Matrix & Futurebound jigsaw puzzle. It’s got a very cinematic feel about it and a nod to our old school roots with the breakbeat verses, all built around a haunting vocal from Dave Gibson.”   “This was one of the records that changed things a lot for us and it went on to become our first top ten hit single. It’s just one of those tracks where the stars aligned and the production, the lyrics and the amazing voice of Max Marshall all add up to create something very powerful. It has never left our DJ sets since we made it and it had to feature on the album.” “Producing tracks like Ear Drum is an essential part of our DNA. We took aim at the floor and wanted to create something that sounds big and heavy but has a progressive feel throughout. It opens with stabs that lock around a twisted chord progression building to a very weighty slice of drums and bass. It’s been getting a great reaction every time we play it.” “Featuring the brilliance of Ayak Thiik on vocals this heavenly slice of D&B is one of our personal favourites from the Mystery Machine project. Ayak delivered on so many levels with this record and we wanted to create an instrumental to do her sublime vocals justice. It was one of the first tracks we started on the album and one of the last to be finished so it was a long journey but we’re very happy with the final destination.”Matrix & Futurebound Mystery Machine is out on Metro/Viper Recordings April 12Join them at XOYO on May 26 ",articles39,"['Matrix & Futurebound’s', 'Mystery Machine', 'Futurebound', 'Calyx & Teebee', 'Mystery Machine', 'Zelah', 'Becky Hill', 'Max Marshall', 'Ayak Thiik', 'Mystery Machine', 'Ayak', 'XOYO']"
"New material, new performance production, new album…Monday March 18: a whole tonne of Pendulum news dropped via London’s South West Four festival as Pendulum were confirmed as new headliners in light of The Prodigy cancelling all live shows following Keith Flint’s tragic passing earlier this month.Perhaps the only band big and influential enough to fill such big shoes, the Australian trio will mark the occasion with the official debut of their Trinity concept.

"Strength in numbers: the last few years in drum & bass have been characterised by many things – more acts going independent and setting up their own labels, the rise in dubplate culture and seismic audio headbutt of the current jump up and jungle renaissances – but few developments have been quite as exciting or enduring as the return of crews and collectives.Once a major distinguishing hallmark of the genre (Bad Company, Ram Trilogy, the Virus camp, the Renegade Hardware camp etc) crews have once again become a dominant voice in drum & bass. From Kings Of The Rollers to SaSaSaS by way of Shadow Demon, Standard Procedure, TNA and many many more, squads and collectives have been leading from the front for several years now.Collectives like Kanine, K Motionz and Simula’s Distress Signal.One of the youngest crews to emerge in recent times, they’ve already made an impressive noise. Launched summer 2018 (with a sold out event in K Motionz hometown Birmingham) and fronted by OG host MC IC3, so far they’ve only done a choice selection of events and released two tracks, Earthquake earlier this year and, most recently, the hooky hurricane that is Stay. This, they tell us, is only the beginning. If you’re lucky enough to be heading to Rampage later this month, you’ll be the first to experience the next chapter in the Distress Signal story. If not, wait for the set to drop online. We called up the trio for their first ever collective interview, this is what we found out…Let’s go back to the start… How did Distress Signal come about?K Motionz: I got approached to set up a bit of a collective and these guys were the most natural option.Kanine: It made sense. We’re on a lot of the same line ups, have played together and toured Belgium and Austria and places like that together. We were playing back to back in some formation  most weekends so it made sense to come together and create something bigger.But you had to have that personal connection, right? If you haven’t got that, it won’t work…Simula: Totally. That’s the most important thing. We’re mates, we have a laugh together and share similar opinions and views on how we do things. That’s what makes it work.Didn’t the name Distress Signal come from a name of one of your tunes Simula?Kanine: We had a few ideas in mind and threw a lot things around, but we kept coming back to some feedback we’d had from a fan saying our music sounded post-apocalyptic and Distress Signal really fit that.Simula: I did have a tune with that name though, so yeah there’s a connection there.K Motionz: We actually had another name in mind for a while. But looking back it was cheesy as fuck.Do tell!K Motionz: Absolutely no chance!What was cool about when you announced the launch was the reactions from a lot of DJs. Darkzy said you were the best boy band ever and Brockie said this was next level. That’s a great snapshot of the diversity of support there…Kanine: Yeah I think that’s a refection of the music we make. None of us are known for just one sound.Simula: We’re all pretty diverse and bring different things to the tracks and cover the full circle.So far we’ve had two tunes… Are they done in real life or online due to schedules and locations?K Motionz: Those two live quite close but I’m two and a half hours away so it’s not always possible to do them in the same studio. Me and Simi have done some tunes over skype sessions.Kanine: We link up when we can if we’re all in the same city. Every couple of months or so.But if you’re booked then it’s guaranteed to be all three of you, right?Kanine: Always. And we’ve also got IC3 on the team. He’s a busy MC so not always available, but he’s our host at as many shows as possible.Take time to big up the mighty IC3!Simula: He’s the best host MC in the game. We knew we wanted him when we started.Kanine: He knows all the tunes, he’s such a sick host, a set with him always kicks off.You need a host when you’ve got so much going on. Like Kings Of The Rollers have Inja… Hosts guide people through the madness and help them understand what’s going on!Kanine: Definitely. Especially because most of what we’re playing is on dub. Tracks we’ve been making together or personally. You need a good host style MC who gets that.So do you all turn up to gigs packing secret persy bombs to outdo each other?Kanine: Yeah there’s definitely a nice heathy competition of who’s going to bring the best dub.That’s how crews work, going right back through history. It’s a good time for crews right now!Kanine: It’s a really heathy thing, I think. Any time artists get together and work on something between them knowledge is shared. Every collaboration you do, you learn something and everyone benefits from it… We do as artists, the music fans do because there’s a new act or project and new releases.Simula: Strength in numbers! It pushes the scene forward.So what’s next?K Motionz: We’ve got a few things planned…Kanine: There’s a few tracks ready now. Quite a few. We’re not quite ready to announce how they’re dropping. It’s something a bit different…One of those ‘watch this space’ things eh?Kanine: For now, but not for long…Is it quite hard aligning your schedules to work together?K Motionz: Sometimes. Personally if I’ve had a busy weekend of gigs then Monday and Tues I have no life, I’m just recovering. Then I’m back on it on Wednesday. Fergus (Kanine) is always on it though, he never seems to stop.Soldier. What ese does the word need to know about Distress Signal right now?Kanine: We’re really excited to play Rampage. When that set goes up on YouTube people will see what Distress Signal is truly all aboutNext level Distress Signal manoeuvres?Kanine: You could say that, yeah haha.I guess if you all play together then these bookings will always be on the more massive end of the spectrum? Your Westfests, your Rampages, your Let It Rolls..Simula: Westfest was one of our best gigs in my opinion. That went off.Kanine: Yeah that was a legendary show.Wasn’t it one of your first?K Motionz: It was pretty early on in our formation but the first was DNB Collective in Birmingham. I think that was pretty much sold out and that was a really sick show. It was a great way to start things off. Especially as we had no tunes out as Distress Signal.That validates things, right? You know you’re onto something…K Motionz: It was really sick. The atmosphere and everything. It felt like we were doing the right thing.Kanine: Especially as we hadn’t even announced any music, let alone release it. For the whole club to be that busy and for that vibe to be there… Yeah, it set us up as we mean to go on. But trust me, we’re only warming up…Distress Signal – Stay is out now Follow Distress Signal: Facebook / Soundcloud  ",articles39,"['–', 'Bad Company', 'Shadow Demon', 'Kanine', '…Let', 'Motionz', 'Those', 'Every', 'IC3', 'Especially', 'Every', 'Motionz', '…', 'Motionz', 'I’m', 'Especially', 'Especially']"
"Well this escalated quickly…Serum, Voltage & Bladerunner only announced their signing to Hospital last April. In fact they’ve only released one EP and a few compilation tracks on the label so far… But all that will change on April 26 when their self-titled debut album drops.17 tracks heavy and featuring the likes of Chimpo, Redders, Bassman, Lydia Plain and their main man Inja, it’s a whole new level of regicide as the popular trio begin to express the same musicality and variety with their productions as they always have with their epic DJ shows. If you’ve seen them play recently you’ll already be aware of this as tracks such as Mammoth, You Got Me and The Sky Is Falling are causing serious damage in their sets right now.They’re not the only ones causing damage… To make this auspicious moment in their ever-escalating rise even more remarkable, our favourite regal roustabouts have also enlisted some of the most impressive b2b2b sets we’ve ever seen for their Royal Rumble tour. We called them up for more information…Album! Didn’t think it was going to happen so quickly?Serum: It was already in the process when we were signing. We were writing tunes while the deal was being finalised but we did have quite a pressing deadline.Was there a different mindset when writing the album? Did you file tunes specific for it or did you consider everything you wrote?Bladerunner: Everything we made, we had the album in the mind.Voltage: Especially once we had the direction and vibe in mind. Everything was totally album focused.Serum: In that time, I don’t think I did much solo stuff at all. We also needed it to have its own vibe and not sound like any one of our solo records which I think makes it more adventurous as a resultBladerunner: There’s still a piece of all of us is on there but in a different waySerum: It took a life of its own as well. It wasn’t a continuation of anything we’d been doing together in collaborations or as individuals. We’d had that one track out, Burnt Ends, which people thought was our sound. Everyone was like ‘okay Kings Of The Rollers’ are just about foghorns. But we actually did that track pretty quickly from one of Voltage’s ideas. Now foghorn rollers are style apparently. But yeah, we had to set it straight that it’s not all we do.Voltage: Mammoth is the only tune on the album that does that kind of long note thing going on. But even that’s a different vibe.Serum: We also wanted to be more musical and have more variety than just bangers.Voltage: Definitely. We’ve done more musical intros than we’ve done before. Dev (Bladerunner) has done some great ones in the past anyway, but together we’ve done some ones I’m really happy with.Bladerunner: We’ve found a way of working and an approach between us that really works together and brought the best out of what we all do I think.Serum: Totally. We’ve also had the added challenge of not using samples.Voltage: That was a mad challenge to be honest. You get that roughness and dirt from samples so we’ve had to work out a way of recreating that.How do you do that?Voltage: We can tell you but we’d have to shave off that beard of yours.Serum: You know when you sheer an animal and it looks all tiny and weird? That’ll be you.That will literally be me. I look five without a beard.Serum: I’m bringing a Gillette to the next gig you come to!The best that man can get! Back to the album… There’s a much wider sound that I think will surprise people with tracks like Tisno and The Sky Is Falling.Serum: Yeah people have posted clips of these tracks and have already been surprised when they’ve found out that they’re ours.Voltage: We’ve been trying to put a different angle on what you can do with intros and vocals in drum & bass. The pianos on The Sky Is Falling were played by the singer Lydia Plain. Things like that show a lot more expression in the intro but without that clinical feel.Serum: Also with vocalists we didn’t want a pop sound. There’s a lot of great singers out there but they have a very modern, clean sound. We wanted something more ‘out there’. We’ve also got our regulars like Inja and Bassman. Bassman’s wicked because he sounds like a sample anyway.Let’s big up Chimpo and Redders too….Voltage: We wanted to work with guys we knew we could build the vibe with but, like Mark said, we were also wary of working with the same MCs and vocalists that appear on a lot of other albums. We just want it to be different and have our own sound and vibe.Were there any moments where you surprised yourselves during the process?Bladerunner: Yeah there was a moment when everything clicked towards the end and it started to all come together.Voltage: We were making the Bassman tune, Shaolin Technique, and we were like ‘fuck! That reese is going to tear people’s faces off!’Serum: It was actually based on a sound from my very first release. I took it, twisted it and turned it into something different and that was kinda the vibe of the album; we’d start with one idea and end up with something completely different by the end of the track. It had mutated as it went along.Voltage: I remember when we finished You Got Me. It was as total different tune to what we started with. It turned into a monsterIt really is a monster! I’ve heard you play this a few times…Serum: I’d say that was the first real big tune off the album that we started playing out and DJs were asking us for. That and Sky Is Falling. It’s been really nice to see that and build the tracks up a bit.So with the Royal Rumble tour as well, there’s a lot going on right now!  Voltage: Yeah it’s been hard work, won’t lie!Serum: Hospital push you. We’re used to making a tune and releasing it. But these guys work on all kinds of ways to get the records out and the music out there. We’ve all been working on the line ups for the nights, all the imagery and marketing and promotions. We finished the album a while ago, but the hard work goes on. It’s exciting and exhausting.Bladerunner: I had no idea how much went on at this type of level. It’s been really interesting, actually. We’ve learnt a lot.Give me an album low… Maybe your own in-house royal rumble scrap?Voltage: Not really, I’m happy to say. We all understand compromise and know that if an idea of ours isn’t working we have to let it go and move on. The fact we can all do that pushes any ego out of the way.Bladerunner: We all want to get the job done and keep making new tracks. All three of us have that type of drive. And we’ve worked together so much we know how we work.Serum: We’ve been working together for so long, if it wasn’t gonna work I think we’d have known before now…Back to your actual Royal Rumble, those b2b2bs tho….Voltage: We’re well happy with them! We’ve gone outside the box with the combinations and believe we’ve managed to pull it off.Yeah that one with Need For Mirrors, Bailey and Krust…Serum: Yeah I’m looking forward to that one. Krust is on fire with his selection at the moment, Need For Mirrors and Bailey are sick and dark and twisted. I want to stay and check that. I’m not taking any more bookings that night so I can stay and check it.These dream collabos are the type of thing messy 7am sesh talk is made of…Voltage: Exactly! And the fans most likely to have those sesh chats are the new generation who’ve just come into drum & bass and are so into it and eager and crying out for stuff like this. It’s sick to see.Bladerunner: We just want to bring out the best in the sets and the styles of drum & bass we love. That’s what it’s all about.That’s wicked. And the DJs are all into the idea too?Serum: Totally. I saw Frost the other day and he was hyped about the show.Who’s the special guest with him and Bryan Gee?Voltage: We can’t tell you that!Serum: It’s almost like you want to lose that beard…Kings Of The Rollers debut album is out April 26Royal Rumble tickets & details",articles39,"['Chimpo', 'Mammoth', 'Voltage', 'Especially', 'Everyone', 'Voltage’s', 'Voltage', 'Mammoth', 'Voltage', 'Voltage', 'That’ll', 'Tisno', 'The Sky Is Falling', 'Voltage', 'Chimpo', 'Mark', '!

"Having spent most of this century rattling bones, cages and souls on some of the most influential labels in the game – Virus, Ram, Subtitles, Bad Taste, Blackout, Freak, Project 51 – D&B heavyweight Audio is now about to shake things up on his own imprint Snake Pit Records.The label launches March 18 with the wily, tightly-coiled chop-slapper Frog March (his first solo release in over 18 months) and will proceed to deliver a new slew of cuts he’s been crafting during his and Ed Rush’s fastlane tenure as Killbox.Unlike many other acts who have always dreamt of running a label, an imprint was never originally on the agenda for Audio. Never shy to step up to a challenge, however, and knowing it’s the right time to establish his own personal stamp and stable, he’s diving right in and counting down the days until it launches.Look out for Frog March on UKF Drum & Bass very soon. In the meantime, here’s how the label came about, and what we can expect in the future…This the first solo Audio stuff since Rat Race isn’t it? Yeah I wanted to focus on the Killbox stuff. We had to give the album everything so I didn’t do anything solo. Well… I hadn’t released any solo stuff. I’d still been working on things but at a slower pace.Was a label always part of the grand plan?No, never! Even growing up and getting into the music, having a label was never one of my ambitions or aspirations. I just wanted to be an artist, release music and DJ. But last year I felt a bit lost; we’d done the Killbox album so I was back to my Audio stuff and my contract with Ram had come to an end. I wasn’t sure what to do; I felt I was in danger of going over old paths and repeating myself a bit which isn’t what I wanted to do. I’ve always prided myself on moving forward; working with Freak, then Virus, then Ram. I have chapters, it’s time for a new one and the most common sense thing to do was to start a label.Yeah you need progress to keep yourself excitedThat’s it. I’ve been in the scene in a long time, I’ve done a lot of things and bought the t-shirt but I want to keep things interesting and keep myself driven. Musically I still feel 19 and still love making music and will never stop but it’s how I get it out there and what I do with it. It’s pretty scary; I’ve never been involved in the back-end of labels, there’s a lot to learn, but it’s really exciting to build up something of my own.Let’s start with this release Frog March. You’re not shy of a good track title you know…Ha! Nice one. I think about them a lot and like them to make sense. Some titles I see I’m like what the fuck? Did you just wake up with that word in your head and call it that? I know Ed Rush is the same, I know he spends a lot of time considering his track titles.Which one of you named Shoreditch Shuffle then? That always tickles me…I think that was both of us. It felt like an old wartime skank to us, like a foxtrot vibe and that’s where it came from. Shuffles, Shoreditch, bang… it came together. Some titles do.From shuffling to marching. Frog March does capture the quirky side to Audio…It came out of nowhere. It had a different top layer which I was messing around with and it ended up becoming this mad thing that reminded me of Russian music. It’s got an eastern European vibe to the riff and it developed from there and followed where the tune wanted to be. Everything I do is organic like that. Nothing is ever forced or contrived.How about the concept for Snake Pit? There’s no missing around with that name…Haha. Yeah I’ve had the name in my head for a while now. Four years or so. I’ve never thought I’d have a label, but I knew if I ever did, that would be the name. Or the title of a track or an EP or an album. I kept it in my head for the right time.I’m noticing an animal theme here…. Frog March, Snake Pit, Rat RaceOh yeah. It’s not a conscious thing but now you mention it….You’re not setting us for the big announcement about leaving drum & bass……. To open a zoo?Yeah!Haha. Well I never thought I’d have a label before recently, so who knows?What type of frequency can we expect in terms of releases? And is this your permanent home now?Yeah there might be the odd appearance on other labels and on collaborations but this is where almost all Audio releases can be found. Eventually I would like to sign people in the future but it’s for me to begin with. I’ve got about six / seven tunes lined up for the year and I just want to slowly build the brand up and see how it goes from there. If I can do someone justice and help them get their music out there, then I’ll sign it but one step at a time. But the main priority is me releasing what I want, when I want. Not subject to schedules. That’s pissed me off over the years. Not in any disrespect to any labels I’ve worked with, I do understand schedules, but as an artist when you write a tune you’re in that moment and it’s nice to have that immediacy and get things out when you’re feeling it. Rather than that feeling that you’ve missed the timing a bit. I’ve never had that control before, it’s quite mad.Yeah a lot of acts who’ve set up their labels have said that. As you say, it’s not a diss on labels they work with, it’s the freedom…That’s it. And I feel I’ve worked with the biggest and best labels in the genre, all the labels I’ve ever dreamt of releasing on; Hardware, Virus, Subtitles, Ram, loads more. I’ve contributed to them and enjoyed working with them, I’ve ticked all the boxes so Snake Pit is the next logical step. I’m excited to see how things develop.Frog March is out March 18 on Snake Pit RecordsFollow Audio: Facebook / Soundcloud  ",articles39,"['Bad Taste', 'Audio', 'Ed Rush’s', 'Audio', 'Audio', 'Audio', '…', 'Audio', '…Haha', '…', 'Audio', 'Snake Pit', 'I’m']"
"After a decade+ of releases, Italian drum & bass craftsman Dabs will release his debut album Wormatic on Dispatch Recordings on March 15.Featuring collaborations with Seattle’s Quadrant & Iris, Nymfo, Illaman and regular MC cohort Kwality, Wormatic traverses the entire spectrum Dabs has been sculpting since he first emerged on the likes of Modulate, Basswerk and Dispatch, the label that he’s most consistently released on in recent times, alongside key releases on equally diverse and innovative labels such as Eatbrain and Horizons. Naturally the album mirrors his wide armed explorative signature and a strong sense of foundations.“The album reflects the different states and my moods surrounding the sonic journey of drum & bass: wild, hypnotic, acoustic, synthetic, electronic…every part is connected and contaminates the others,” Dabs explains. “Every sound can evoke a frame of the past, and shaping the future in a different and eclectic way. What I wanted to say is that there are no boundaries. I wrote what I felt needed to be expressed without defining any main style or subgenre.”Dabs, real name Davide Rustici, continues to exalt his love of drum & bass’s versatility and endless melting pot combinations and how Wormatic, like any serious debut artist album, is a deeply personal creation.“Not many kinds of bass music will actually allow so much freedom,” he explains. “The LP shows the vibes of my life, soundscapes of when I was a kid in the city with a walkman in my pocket and a spray-can in the other and up until now, when I’m a grown up man, sometimes walking in cities that never sleep.”Don’t sleep on this one: Dabs has crafted an album that taps deep into the roots we share and his own personal route into the genre. As Italian drum & bass has begun to truly flourish in the last few years, Wormatic has landed at a critical time and acts as a document for everything that dug the foundations, set the scene and continues to lead the way for one of the most exciting music movements in Europe right now.Dabs – Wormatic is out March 15 on DispatchFollow Dabs: Facebook / Soundcloud / Twitter ",articles39,"['Illaman', 'Dabs', 'Modulate', 'Basswerk', 'Dispatch', '”Dabs', 'I’m']"
"Rave culture has lost its most iconic characters and souls…It has been reported that The Prodigy’s larger than life frontman Keith Flint was found dead in his Essex home this morning by police after concerns were made for his welfare. The band’s lynchpin Liam Howlett posted this morning on Instagram that Keith had tragically taken his own life.Keith’s role in The Prodigy was absolutely pivotal to the band’s meteoric success when he developed from dancer to singer and wild, sometimes demonic front man. If Liam Howlett’s incredible production was the vehicle for the band, a tank ploughing through mainstream culture, Keith was the driver; the gung-ho zero-fuck-free captain firing off cannons in all directions. A true punk at heart, he gave the band a focus, a voice and an energy that has yet to be matched by any of their peers… And quite possibly never will be. It’s no coincidence that the band’s two biggest number one hits were fronted by him.Never outnumbered, never outgunned, blatantly one of the coolest Keiths to ever walk the planet; Flint’s voice, attitude and energy were one of the biggest accelerants in switching every generation into ravers since 1990… And were stronger than they had been in over 10 years with the band’s new album No Tourists. Released last last November and backed by an incendiary live show, Keith, aged only 49, seemed like he was still at the height of his powers which makes today’s news even more shocking, gutting and genuinely upsetting. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.Keith Flint, rest in peace.  ",articles39,"['The Prodigy’s', 'Keith’s', 'Flint’s']"
"Photography: Steven TjoengDutch soul man Lenzman has confirmed that his second artist album Bobby will be released on March 29 via Metalheadz.Landing five years after his debut album Looking At The Stars, Bobby is 16 tracks deep and features collaborations with the likes of Children Of Zeus, DRS, LSB and Artificial Intelligence. Heavily influenced by the life-changing new chapter in his life as a father and his reflections on his own childhood it’s his most personal body of work to date… Right down to the illustration from his father as the cover art.Rolling with just as much jazz sensibility as it does soulful elements, there’s a rawness and warmth that runs throughout as Lenzman takes us back to his roots but from his more mature, experienced and, as he says himself, confident perspective. Stripped back, emotional, understated and not afraid to roll out in a few places, it’s the latest in a long line of remarkable releases from the Amsterdam artist born Teije van Vliet… Not just his own releases, but everything he’s nurtured, encouraged and presented to the world on his label The North Quarter. A label he’s been taking from strength to strength, all the while penning a new album on Metalheadz.Ever one for the fine art of surprise, Lenzman has been keeping the album schtum since he finished last September. Until now. The first track Rain, with Children Of Zeus will be the first single from the album. Here’s everything else we can expect when Bobby drops later this month…Didn’t see this coming!I purposefully held it down. We live in this age when people almost feel entitled to have anything when they want it so it’s better not to let people know it even exists. I also think people might not expect me to release my album on Metalheadz and I like that surprise factor. So we all held it down and kept quiet until it was the very last minute.I hear that. So who is Bobby?Well the album kinda started to take shape since I’d become a parent. That whole process made me revisit my childhood quite a lot and made me look at things through a different perspective. I was thinking a lot about my own childhood and I played the music I loved during the earlier part of my life. I was using it as inspiration for the album. But in terms of who Bobby actually is, it’s my daughter’s stuffed dog toy she really likes. She named it Bobby herself and that symbolises the whole family thing for me. I was dealing with the thought process, but I don’t think I could explain that in words when I started the album, or why I called it Bobby, but it all made sense to me. When I thought about Bobby it all clicked, it’s an intriguing name and it rolls of the tongue. Plus no one asked me why I called my last album Looking At The Stars but everyone I’ve showed the album to has asked me who Bobby is so I’ve definitely done better with my title at least.I love that. It’s a pretty significant moment when a kid names their own toy, it’s a very early independent decisionYeah totally. Then I thought it would be a cool thing to have my dad involved. I grew up with him when my mum moved to the UK. He was a single parent and was an illustrator at the time. I got him to draw the cover so that fits in with the whole concept.Who is it with you in the drawing?Kids from the neighbourhood, The North Quarter. It was a very specific time in my life with me and my dad.Usually the debut album is a deeply personal one and the second one doesn’t enjoy that depth of scope but clearly not for you…Yeah I think when I did my first album I was a lot more insecure as an artist. I wasn’t as confident about what I wanted to write. I think some of what I wrote had a certain style and sound I felt was expected of me perhaps. Not that anyone put any pressure on me, but writing my debut for Metalheadz, I did feel a lot of pressure, I’m not sure I felt totally free. I learnt a lot from that and from launching The North Quarter. It’s about asking myself how can I write soulful music but change it up? The first album was a lot more about electronic soul with a lot more synth work, whereas this is much more jazz influenced.I hear that. Rain is jazz as hell!It’s heavy in the jazz elements isn’t it? I also wanted to go on more of a minimal approach. The first album was musically too busy and had a lot going on. I wanted to strip it back and make it more understated. I listen to a lot of jazz now and a lot of hip hop that samples jazz.Have you been digging for samples on Bobby?No, it’s interesting. There’s not as many samples as you might think. I played a lot myself myself. Rain has got no samples on it.Is that you on the keys?Yeah that’s been a journey in itself. I realised that samples have those human imperfections that give character to the track. It’s very hard to recreate that character when you play the music yourself. I’ve been trying to master that for a long time and I’m happy with a lot of the things I’ve played on there.How did you get round that?I guess it’s finding beauty in your imperfections. We’ve become obsessed with sounding louder and heavier and cleaner so even when we play something in we quantize it, put all the levels up so the velocity of the notes are perfectly aligned. It becomes stale that way. But if the timing is off or if you hit one wrong note it gives character to the chords so I’ve kept it raw in that respect.Another strong aspect to the album is the collaborative element. The strong Manchester theme that runs on The North Quarter is there, so are friends like Artificial Intelligence and LSB.Yeah. On the first album I didn’t want to have any collaborations on there because I wanted it to be a personal statement. So it’s a nice switch up and these are guys who I really respect and wanted to have on board to help create more diversity in the sound but still totally fitting with the story of the album. In terms of vocalists, it’s sick that Children Of Zeus were up for it. Obviously I did the remix but they’ve never done an original drum & bass track as Children Of Zeus before. I also wanted to get Konny on something solo because Tyler has been on a lot of tracks and I wanted to show what he’s capable of.So this album has been brewing while you were developing your label and getting into the role of fatherhood?Well it took me less time than I finished the first one. I think the writing took about a year and I finished it last September. But yeah, I was also developing The Norther Quarter, which was kickstarted by the new changes in my life 100 percent. So you’re right; there was a lot going on. I promised Metalheadz a second album and it was the right time to do it. I wasn’t contracted but I wanted to stand by my word because they were really helpful to me both when I broke through and when I set up The North Quarter. I wanted to respect that.Did developing The North Quarter have an influence on your writing and your development as an artist?I think the main thing it’s done is made me more confident about everything I do. I have developed how I write though, but it’s not directly linked to the label. Before every track I started I would finish which is very time consuming. But with this album I would sit down and write some sketches. Each one would take no more than an hour. I did that every day whenever I could for a while. I’d leave them for a couple of months and come back with a totally fresh perspective and work out what sounded good and what didn’t. It’s really interesting. It’s like listening to someone else’s music and you can be so much more objective.Perspective. Time does interesting things…Yeah if you’re really involved in something you put a lot of pressure on yourself for it to be good. Pressure is never good in a creative space. You need it to finish something but you don’t need it during that early sketching stage. The first hour is instrumental to anything being good or not. After that the rest is just grinding but that first hour is magic. It’s been a life changing approach for me, it’s saved me so much time and changed how I think about music.Maybe reduced over thinking, too?Yeah I think over thinking and writers block are directly related to pressure. You want everything to be amazing but you think everything is shit. But if you’re only investing an hour in getting an idea down then you don’t feel the pressure to continue with it if you don’t think it’s got potential. It gives you a lot of freedom. I’ve really enjoyed this making this….Lenzman – Bobby is out March 29 on Metalheadz – Pre-order here.Follow Lenzman: Facebook / Soundcloud / Twitter",articles39,"['Heavily', 'Stripped', 'I’m', 'Have', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'The North Quarter', 'Pressure']"

"Cheese exposed to rap gives it ""a discernibly stronger smell and stronger, fruitier taste""...Hip-hop helps maturing cheese taste richer, a study has found.A Swiss experiment delightfully called Cheese in Surround Sound has found exposing cheese to music while it ages gives it a better flavour, with nine 22-pound wheels of Emmental put in wooden crates subjected to five different genres and three sine frequencies for 24 hours a day for six months.Some of the tunes included Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven', Vril's techno cut 'UV' and Mozart's 'The Magic Flute', but it was A Tribe Called Quest's 'Jazz (We've Got)' which came out on top, with the food technologists at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences stated the song had ""a discernibly stronger smell and stronger, fruitier taste than the other test samples"".The study, investigating how sound waves might impact the microorganisms within cheese which gives it its flavour, came to the general conclusion: ""cheeses exposed to music had a generally mild flavour compared to the control test sample"". This was believed to be the effect of music with lower frequencies, rather than necessarily down to Q-Tip and co.'s sick bars and beats.What's even more remarkable is that the cheeses were then presented to a panel of judges for blind tasting; and they unanimously preferred Tribe's cheese wheel.DJ Mag can't stop thinking about what cheese and dance music crossovers we could have.

"The MSG Sphere would hold 21,500 people... Plans have been submitted for the UK's largest concert arena, MSG Sphere.If built, the structure would stand 90-metres high and occupy land in Stratford, next to the Olympic Park. US-based Madison Square Garden Company (MSG), owner of the world-famous New York venue, is behind the proposal, and has purchased 1.9-hectares at the site. The development is subject to planning permission, but former-Culture Secretary Matt Hancock and London Mayor Sadiq Khan are in support. The arena would seat 17,566 people, or hold 21,500 with standing, beating both the O2 Arena (20,000) and Manchester Arena (21,000). One of the most striking aspects of the design are the external LED-panels, enabling event footage or advertising to be shown on the fabric of the building. There is also room for a 1,500-capacity space, potentially offering a platform for grassroots and rising stars. The plans are not without critics. MSG's executive chair James Dolan donated to Donald Trump's presidential campaign and previously sat on the board of the Weinstein Company. The site could also be used for around 1,400 homes, helping ease the area's affordable housing crisis. Nevertheless, it's claimed construction would create more than 4,000 jobs over three years, and 3,200 annually after opening. London has already seen two major new venues announced this year, Dock X at Surrey Quays and Exhibition in Shepherd's Bush.

Brooklyn Record Exchange will first welcome customers at 599 Johnson Avenue, Bushwick, on Saturday 30th March. It will share the address with revered club and live venue Elsewhere.A second location at 87 Guernsey Street, Greenpoint, will open later in spring— where Co-op 87 was doing business until its recent temporary closure.  According to reports, there will be dedicated areas for Mexican Summer releases, alongside its reissue imprint Anthology Recordings. Albums, singles and EPs from other labels will also be sold, of course, as will books and films. The demand for vinyl continues to grow in many countries, hence several high-profile record stores starting up in key cities of late. We recently spread the word about new shops in Berlin (from the Griessmuehle crew no less) and Paris. In the US, there were 16.8million albums sold on wax in 2018 alone. OK folks - BIG ANNOUNCEMENT! Co-op 87 has joined forces with Mexican Summer/Anthology on a brand new record store! BROOKLYN RECORD EXCHANGE is BIGGER and BETTER and in BUSHWICK! Located in the same building as Elsewhere and Mission Chinese, right off of the Jefferson L stop. Our grand opening is THIS SATURDAY March 30th. We've got an amazing selection of records and you are NOT going to want to miss out. You may have noticed that Co-op 87 has been closed lately. Fear not, we will be re-opening in Greenpoint in the near future, but for now please visit us in our new digs. New store, same knuckleheads.

"There were 345 complaints in the last two years... Ibiza's officials have fined venues almost €1.4 million since imposing stricter licensing laws on San Antonio in 2017. There were a total of 345 complaints to authorities in the last two years, with the majority concerning noise pollution. This is linked to a Special Acoustic Protection Zone, imposed on San Antonio's West End from January 2018 after venues were found to be breaking legal restrictions by 20db during the previous two seasons. The council also began implementing earlier club closing times.According to a report by Diario de Ibiza, €630,000 of penalties have already been collected, and a further €747,000 are being processed. The latter figure is split across 20 venues, with one address accounting for €247,000 after receiving 93 noise complaints. Other reasons for the fines include promoting events without permission.

The report claimed that “the installation of a mirror ball implies an intent to provide for a dance floor. Police would have concern that the installation of a mirror ball in a premise that has not been approved for a dance floor could mean that the premises is being used for purposes not allowed.”Justine Baker, CEO of Sydney bar group Solotel, who own Goros, said, ""It’s a small bar with great music and there’s lot of quirky Japanese games and karaoke rooms. It’s a very different model to a nightclub. But if we put a mirror ball on the ceiling and people danced underneath, it starts to operate like a nightclub. It’s just crazy, you can’t regulate people wanting to have fun, so we don’t have a mirror ball or a dance floor and people just end up dancing where they want.”Last month, Glitterbox kickstarted a petition to encourage the creation of a disco ball emoji.A 100-foot disco ball featured at Burning Man 2018.Back in December, we asked: is it time for a total ban on phones on the dancefloor?www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Help save a beloved London venue...Music-lovers are being called to join a funding campaign to save legendary London music hangout, the Social - which is fighting the site becoming a cocktail bar.The Heavenly Records run venue began as a Sunday club-night at the Albany Pub in 1994, where The Chemical Brothers had their first London residency. Soon clubbers were queuing around the block.From here The Social moved to Smithfields and Turnmills before getting their current venue on Little Portland Street.Opening in the summer of 1999, it joined a thriving Central London scene that included the Astoria, LA2, The End, Plastic People and Madame JoJos. None of which survive.The Social is still a successful venue. Despite its intimate size, massive names line-up to play - including the Chemical Brothers, Beck, Jazzy B, Adele, Fatboy Slim, Bon Iver, Aphex Twin, Florence and the Machine, Cold War Steve, Young Fathers, DJ Yoda,  Jack White, Irvine Welsh, Saint Etienne, Black Midi, Laura Marling, the Avalanches, Sleaford Mods, Hot Chip, Lily Allen, Arctic Monkeys, For Tet, Justin Robertson and many more.The venue is embedded in the music community and this week it turned to the community with a crowd-funding campaign to raise £95k. Within the first 24 hours over £17,000 had been donated. “We’re blown away,” says The Social’s Carl Gosling. “Not just the fundraising, but the love and good vibes.”On hearing the news Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim), who famously sorted his records out on the floor of the gents, tweeted: “So many friends made so much good music, so much love. How can we let it slip away?”The money will buy a controlling share from the leaseholder. Without this the venue will close its doors in two weeks.Too many of the UK’s historic clubs have closed.

"Over 50 million uploaded pieces of music have been deleted from Myspace.Word spread over the weekend after a user on Reddit’s r/technology Subreddit made a post outlining how, last year, they noticed that all of their music uploaded from 2015 and before had disappeared. The once ubiquitous social media platform has since confirmed that, following a “server migration project”, all of those files were corrupted and are, indeed, gone for good.A statement at the top of Myspace’s current homepage reads, ”As a result of a server migration project, any photos, videos, and audio files you uploaded more than three years ago may no longer be available on or from Myspace. We apologize for the inconvenience.”The vast archive of music, photography and film had been uploaded by over 14 million users over the course of 12 years.After being founded in 2003 and bought by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation in 2005, Myspace became the largest social media platform in the world. In 2006, it was the second most visited site in the U.S., second only to Google. Toward the end of the noughties however, it would be gradually dethroned by emerging platforms like Facebook and Twitter. In 2016, Myspace was acquired Time Inc. Andy Baio, who is one of the team behind Kicksarter, was one of the first to break the news over Twitter this weekend. He has also expressed scepticism as to whether the incident has indeed been an accident. I'm deeply skeptical this was an accident. Flagrant incompetence may be bad PR, but it still sounds better than ""we can't be bothered with the effort and cost of migrating and hosting 50 million old MP3s."" Was just talkin bout this a few days ago.

The auction won't come close to covering the total of what McFarland owes to investors and others but it's thought that they will get a cut of the proceeeds from the sales based on what they lost. It's not yet known when the auction will take place. Last month, McFarland was ordered to pay $3 million to EHL Funding, one of his former investors, while it was also revealed that a spoof film on the festival was in the works starring Seth Rogan.Over £120,000 was raised for Maryann Rolle in January.

"Apple Music is the only streaming service not to contest it...The US Copyright Board (CRB) ruled last month there should be an increase in music royalties for songwriters and publishers - Spotify, Amazon, Google and Pandora have all appealed against this decision.The tech giants are looking to stop the proposed increase in songwriter royalties from on-demand streaming from 10.5 percent to 15.1 percent in the US over a five-year period, a 44% increase. Each filed their own appeal, with Apple Music the only streaming service not to contest it.Causing obvious outroar amongst publishers and songwriters, David Israelite, president of the National Music Publishers Association, was reported in Music Business Worldwide as calling it a move to “sue songwriters”, adding: “No amount of insincere and hollow public relations gestures such as throwing parties or buying billboards of congratulations or naming songwriters ‘geniuses’ can hide the fact that these big tech bullies do not respect or value the songwriters who make their businesses possible.”Spotify have responded with a blog post of their own. In it they justify their actions by saying that it will “hurt consumers”. Israelite has responded to this in turn.Google, Pandora and Spotify also released a joint statement saying:“The Copyright Royalty Board, in a split decision, recently issued the U.S. mechanical statutory rates in a manner that raises serious procedural and substantive concerns.“If left to stand, the CRB’s decision harms both music licensees and copyright owners.

"The new DAW-style software aims to help DJs make music…Serato have launched a new music-making software called Studio. The DAW-style software was designed to help DJs who want to make music without the steep learning curve of most modern DAWs. Currently in public beta, Serato Studio has a similar GUI and feel to Serato DJ including coloured waveforms to show the audio content of a sample at a glance. Studio also uses a DJ-style mixing interface with two vertical faders, three-band EQ and gain controls. The main concept is based around keeping every sample in time and in key – using Serato's famous Pitch'n'Time algorithm, any sample you load will automatically be key- and tempo-shifted to match the project you're working on.Samples and cue points within them are triggered using MIDI clip-style programming and there are tonnes of built-in FX and MIDI presets to get you started on your drum programming. Users can also drop in their own VST and AU plugins, or stem out their work to move it to another DAW for more advanced features and mixing. Release date and pricing are forthcoming but you can sign up for the beta here. Earlier this year SoundCloud and Serato detailed a new partnership to stream the music-hosted service directly into the DJ software.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Researchers at the University of Utah are considering developing music-based treatments for dementia-suffering patients...Music helps with Alzheimers and dementia, a new study has found, as well as triggering that feeling of being ""buzzed"" or moved.What's called the salience network of the brain is linked to Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR). Although ASMR has become popular through videos featuring the sound of people doing everyday things like breathing, it's also synonymous with the joy, thrill and calm which all kinds of melodies afford people, whether that's soothing jazz or blaring 140 bpm techno. ASMR also diarises our favourite music, the melodies that click most beautifully with us, so that each time we hear them that sensory response is retriggered; which, according to The Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer’s Disease, means that our favourite music can be used as a weapon against the tragic, memory-distorting effects of Alzheimers disease and dementia. It numbs anxiety for patients.Jeff Anderson M.D. P.H.D., associate professor in radiology at the University of Utah, believes music can act as an effective treatment for sufferers of the illness: ""We believe music will tap into the salience network of the brain that is still relatively functioning.""A graduate student in the Brain Network Lab, Jace King, added quite poetically to this theory, that ""When you put headphones on dementia patients and play familiar music, they come alive[...] Music is like an anchor, grounding the patient back in reality.""www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Photo by Santiago Bluguermann/LatinContent/Getty Images Rammstein are set to release a self-titled album, their first in eight years, on May 17. In the process of promoting the release, the German hard rockers have managed to upset a whole lot of people. This week, the group released a dramatic promo video for their lead single “Deutschland,” which portrayed members of the band at the gallows with nooses around their necks, dressed like prisoners in a Nazi concentration camp with one even donning the yellow Star of David. Understandably, the provocative and deeply upsetting visual caused a bit of controversy.  In particular, the teaser upset Charlotte Knobloch, a Holocaust survivor and former president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, who told German publication Bild: “With this video, the band has crossed a line. The instrumentalization and trivialization of the Holocaust, as shown in the images, is irresponsible.” The current president of the Central Council of Jews Josef Schuster added, ""Whoever misuses the Holocaust for marketing purposes acts in a deplorable and immoral way"" while Felix Klein, who heads Germany's office on anti-Semitism, chimed in: “I think it is a tasteless exploitation of artistic freedom.” While Rammstein have yet to respond to the backlash, they have released the full nine-minute video for “Deutschland,” which adds some context to the controversial images. Directed by Specter Berlin, the clip reconciles Germany’s violent past by highlighting multiple eras of the country’s history including the Nazi regime. In the song’s chorus, which has been translated from German, frontman Till Lindemann sings, “Germany—my heart in flames / Want to love and condemn you / Germany—your breath cold / So young, and yet so old.” It’s pretty clear the band is critiquing the monstrous actions of their home country and while it’s clear they set to do this in an ambitious and cinematic way, it’s not enough to say it was done in good taste.

"Screenshot from NPR's Tiny DeskBy now, you've probably watched a ton of NPR Tiny Desk Concerts but you've probably never seen anyone perform one in a pink mask. But what else could you expect from Brooklyn rapper Leikeli47, the mask is what makes her feel invincible. Last November, she released her sophomore album Acrylic, a concept album around the long, extravagant nails sported by the black women she grew up around. Now, she's giving the vibrant album a jazzy facelift with the help of her four-piece band, the TSA band (yes, they're dressed like actual TSA agents). In a 17-minute performance, she opens with Wash & Set's ""Attitude"" changing the ""Kelis is God, so is Beyoncé"" breakdown to rely heavily on the keys, bass, and drums behind her. Leikeli sings a sultry duet (""Let's Get Stoned"") with Portier, who plays the keyboard, just before launching into the higher energy of ""Girl Blunt."" The entire set is a testament that Leikeli's music doesn't really fit into one genre. It can be transformed any way she pleases. Kristin Corry is a staff writer for Noisey. Follow her on Twitter.

"Photo by Christine Lai 2018 was the year of yeehaw. The western  Red Dead Redemption 2 was the best-selling video game, a lanky child yodeling in a Walmart counted as one of the music industry’s biggest breakouts, and Kacey Musgraves’ LP  Golden Hour would go on win the 2019 Grammy for Album of the Year. This morning, Mac Demarco said giddy up and continued the trend by announcing his fourth official album  Here Comes The Cowboy, out May 10. The lead single is called “Nobody,” and features of self-directed video where Demarco dons a cowboy hat and lizard makeup.  If you’re the type person who’s already heard of an artist like Mac Demarco, there’s a good chance his album title sounds vaguely familiar. You’re probably thinking, “whoa, didn’t Mitski, who doesn’t sound like Mac, release a critically acclaimed album in 2018 called  Be The Cowboy, an LP that also had a single called “Nobody?” These are all facts. Mitski’s album may be the defining document of last year’s cowboy revival. However, whatever similarities between the titles are purely coincidental, according to both Demarco and Mitski.  Demarco’s publicist (who coincidentally and hilariously, is also Mitski’s representative) told Pitchfork that he chose his album and single title before he even knew of Mitski’s album. For her part, Mitski laughed off the whole thing and tweeted, “I'm 100% sure Mac & I just went fishing in the same part of the collective unconscious! What's wild is we have the same PR, so I LOVE my personal conspiracy theory that she heard the album+track titles but kept quiet thinking maybe some Mac fans will mistakenly find me.” Fortunately, this town  is really big enough for both Mitski and Mac Demarco.

"Photo by Graham MacIndoe In what’s great news for fans of morose and meticulously-arranged indie rock, The National announced their eighth album  I Am Easy To Find. It’s out May 17 via 4AD and is the band’s follow-up to their excellent 2017 LP  Sleep Well Beast. But this isn’t a typical album announcement for the veteran rockers: the full-length is paired with a 24-minute short film of the same name directed by Mike Mills ( Beginners, 20th Century Women). As a press release states, “The former is not the video for the latter; the latter is not the soundtrack to the former.” The film stars Academy Award-winner Alicia Vikander, features music from the album, and will be out the same day as the album. Watch the trailer below.  To go with the announcement, the National aslo shared lead single “You Had Your Soul With You,” which boasts guest vocals from Gail Ann Dorsey, a longtime touring vocalist for David Bowie. While it’s a pretty buoyant track musically, the lyrics are practically soaked in melancholy with frontman Matt Berninger singing, “And I just can't find a way to forgive myself / I had only one thing left / And I couldn't see it yet.” But it’s Dorsey who shines on the song with her masterfully taking over the third verse.  That collaboration with Dorsey is one of many on the LP with Sharon Van Etten, Kate Stables Brooklyn Youth Chorus, Lisa Hannigan, and Mina Tindle also guesting. Berninger explained in a statement, “Yes, there are a lot of women singing on this, but it wasn't because, ‘Oh, let's have more women's voices. It was more, ‘Let's have more of a fabric of people's identities.’ It would have been better to have had other male singers, but my ego wouldn't let that happen.” I Am Easy To Find was produced by Mills and the National and mostly recorded at Long Pond, Hudson Valley, NY.

"Hutton Supancic/Getty Images; Jason Merritt/Getty ImagesEvery day feels like there’s a constant barrage of new music with single premieres, album streams, music videos, and teasers all competing for your attention. Even for folks who are paid to keep tabs on current releases, it’s pretty difficult to stay updated on everything without being totally overwhelmed. Today, this especially feels true as there already almost 10 new tracks worth writing about even before my coffee kicks in. To make things easier, we’ve decided to compile the best of the best. From the triumphant returns of Black Mountain, The Get Up Kids, and Kindness, to hot new songs from Claude Fontaine, Khalid, and more, dive into today’s top tracks below.Following a five-year band hiatus, rock veterans the Black Keys are back with the driving “Lo/Hi.” It’s a bluesy, riff-heavy, and gospel-imbued track like most of the band’s best singles. While there’s no news of a forthcoming LP, it’s reasonable to assume there will be an announcement in the coming months.It’s a big day for bands with the word “Black” in their name coming off a multi-year break. Canadian psych mainstays Black Mountain have announced  Destroyer, which is due May 24 via Jagjaguwar. Heavy guitarmonies anchor lead single “Future Shade,” which is also a total ripper. As a taste of [her forthcoming debut LP], Fontaine has shared single “Pretending He Was You.” Here, Fontaine trades her love for reggae and rocksteady for a rich Bossa Nova-inspired arrangement. It’s a hypnotic and romantic track, with Fontaine longingly crooning, “All I have is my dream of the past / keeping me company.”  —Josh Terry,  “Claude Fontaine’s Transportive Songs are for Crate-Diggers” After a period of inactivity since 2011’s  There Are Rules, emo trailblazers and recent Polyvinyl signees The Get Up Kids make for lost time on the anxious and anthemic “Satellite.” It’s the first preview of the band’s new album  Problems, which is out May 10. Khalid’s soulful and infectious music always feels like summer and the breezy “My Bad,” is no exception, even if it deals with the 2019 malaise of missing texts. The song is featured on the 21-year-old singer’s forthcoming album  Free Spirit, which hits stores April 5 through RCA Records. Kindness’ Adam Bainbridge has been busy working with artists like Solange, Blood Orange, and Robyn, since they released their last album in 2014,  Otherness. But now, the polymath electronic musician has shared their first single since then in “Cry Everything.” The track guests Robyn, who is currently touring with Bainbridge and featured on their 2014 single “Who Do You Love.” Composer, songwriter, and loop aficionado Kishi Bashi has a new album out May 31 called  Omoiyari and its lead single “Summer of ‘42” is incredibly affecting. The whole LP deals with the internment of thousands of Japanese-American families during World War II and as Bashi explained in a statement to NPR, “It's a love story set in World War II, about falling in love in an incarceration camp and ultimately losing that love. The significance is that the idea of love, loss, and desire are consistent themes throughout history and help us to empathize with a people in a disconnected past.""Local Natives’ music has always felt synonymous with the band’s home base of Los Angeles. The sunny, southern California road trip vibes of the group’s latest music video for new song “Café Amarillo” hammer this point home. The band paired the release, which is the first song they put out since 2016’s  Sunlit Youth, with a spring tour announcement. Anthony Gonzalez has been a prolific film score composer in addition to his work as M83, providing the soundtracks for movies like 2013's  Oblivion and  You and the Night. This year, he's back with music for the upcoming French film  Knife + Heart, directed by Gonzalez’s brother Yann, which apparently is a “noir-tinged erotic slasher that explores the seedy underbelly of Paris in the 1970s.""

"Photo by Randy Holmes via Getty Images On February 19, Tierra Whack, the immensely talented Philadelphia rapper, decided to release a new single each week, dubbing the experiment “Whack History Month” to follow-up her 15-minute 2018 debut  Whack World. So far, the singles have showcased her obvious versatility and the latest entry is no exception. The fifth installment in the series, “Unemployed,” which dropped Tuesday morning, boasts Whack’s commanding presence over a rattling bass beat as she raps, “The wait is over, I'm taking over / You overweight, you ate a soda.”  Whack premiered the song via Zane Lowe’s World Record on Beats 1. In an interview with the Apple Music host, she explained, “Rap got boring to me for a long time so I just started singing more. But it was one of those days where I was home recording in Philly, and [co-writer Kenete Simms] hit the beat and it was hitting. I thought people think I can't rap anymore so I just gotta rap."" She also said that the song got an assist from her mom: “My mom is never in the studio with me, but she was in the studio that day and she like basically helped me with the hook.” The no-frills rap is a stark departure from some of Whack’s other singles in her self-proclaimed “Whack History Month,” like the silky organ-led R&B of “Wasteland.” It’s this sort of flexibility that shows that even though Whack is no longer releasing one-minute songs, she’s more than able to stretch out and let her songwriting breathe. Other songs in the series like introspective “Only Child” tackled a breakup while booming “Clones” and thoughtful “Gloria” might be the most infectious of the bunch. Five weeks straddling both February and March isn't exactly a traditional Gregorian month, which opens up a lot of possibilities for Tierra. Maybe ""Whack History Month"" can just last forever.Get the best of Noisey, delivered to your inbox every day.",articles,['Tuesday']
" Nardwuar isn’t for everyone. Some of the Canadian music journalist and radio personality’s most notorious interviews are with artists who don’t necessarily appreciate his cartoonish vibe, like this hilariously combative chat with Henry Rollins from 1998 or the band Blur being complete dickheads to him in 2003. But his best, and most watched, conversations are with artists who are into his persona, play along with the schtick, and reveal fascinating stories about their background thanks to Nardwuar’s meticulously researched questions.  His just released interview with Blueface splits this difference in the best way. Nardwuar talked with the rapper before he headlined Lyrical Lemonade’s 2019 SXSW showcase, and while the “Thotiana” artist wasn’t confrontational, he was definitely confused as hell by the whole thing. Specifically, Blueface was really perplexed about how he was going to play all the vinyl records he received during the chat. At one point, he exclaims, “I don’t know how you expect me to play these things.” It got worse when the next gift was a Juvenile/Cash Money cassette.  The whole interview is worth a look considering Blueface and Nardwuar’s simultaneously awkward and charming dynamic throughout. Perhaps the best moment comes when Blueface is obviously stunned by having to answer questions about his high school football stats and his neighborhood growing up. Watch it below.

"ScHoolboy Q has been quietly teasing his upcoming fifth studio album ever since the release of his 2016 LP  Blank Face. Though a recent update from his label TDE claimed it was “90 to 95% done,” in September, ScHoolboy announced that “I just don’t feel right putting out an album” following the death of his friend and collaborator Mac Miller. But now, with the release of the ruthless and compelling single “Numb Numb Juice,” the upcoming effort seems imminent. Clocking in at a breathlessly efficient sub-two minute runtime, the new track finds ScHoolboy at his most confrontational. Produced by Nez & Rio, DJ Fu, and Hykeem Carter, “Numb Numb Juice” hits extremely hard with in-your-face programmed drums and a hefty dose of rattling bass. He’s menacing throughout, clowning in the refrain, “Faking like you got it in your pockets, yeah, that's bitch shit / Talking to them hoes, you steady gossip, yeah, that's bitch shit.” Listen to the track below and watch the video, directed by Dave Free and Jack Begert.Get the best of Noisey, delivered to your inbox every day.",articles,"['Blank Face', 'Hykeem Carter', 'Dave Free']"
"ScHoolboy Q seems like a fun guy.

Last night, Groovy Q took the stage at The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to perform the single but little did fans know we were in for a treat. Not only did he perform ""Numb Numb Juice,"" but ScHoolboy also premiered ""Chopstix,"" an unreleased track before announcing that a new album would be coming ""very, very, very, very, very, very soon."" When the menacing production of ""Numb Numb Juice"" fizzles away, the crowd is met with Q stumbling across the stage to ""Chopstix."" Travis Scott's voice appears on the song's hook, which gives ScHoolboy plenty of time to improvise. The result is a series of dance moves, infamous crotch grabs, and a two-step that Drake may or may not have done in ""Hotline Bling.""

"Pete Davidson: Photo by Ray Tamarra/GC Images , Kanye West: Photo by Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic via Getty ImagesIn January when Kim Kardashian tweeted a photo of Timothée Chalamet, Kid Cudi, Pete Davidson, and Kanye West at a dinner table, fans of the crew desperately wanted to be a fly on the wall at Nobu Malibu. We may not know the entire scoop, but thanks to Pete Davidson we're one step closer to some intel. During Vanity Fair's Take a Lie Detector Test, Davidson and Machine Gun Kelly take turns interviewing each other while hooked up to a polygraph test. Kelly asks Davidson who picked up the check, and the Saturday Night Live cast member is glad to set the record straight. ""I did,"" he said through a smirk. ""I want people to know this."" No lies detected. According to Davidson, the dinner was originally between him and Cudi, but that didn't stop Kanye from ordering the most expensive things on the menu. ""Kanye kept ordering the whole entire time,"" Davidson told Kelly. ""I didn't know he was coming and I already put my card down to pay because I thought it was just me and Cudi and then Chalamet showed up and Kanye showed up and I was like, 'Oh fuck.' Then I had to book two more gigs in Ohio."" Machine Gun Kelly is asking the burning questions we all want to know when he asks if 'Ye's a dessert guy (because ice cream can't possibly be the only thing that makes him happy ). ""He's an order the fucking everything because I can and then we all have one bite, maybe... because fuck you... guy.""Davidson doesn't give us the entire rundown on the night, but he's dropping enough breadcrumbs to conclude that Kanye probably isn't the best date. Not only did he show up to dinner unexpected, but by ordering some of the most expensive things on the menu and barely eating them he committed a cardinal sin.

"Photo by Tim WalkerOn Friday Solange released a beautiful new album in When I Get Home. It's a gorgeous and layered 19 tracks that you'll want to sit with for a while. Which is why it's impressive that, as Solange explains a new interview with i-D that discusses the making of the album, a majority of the tracks were recorded in one take. What I love so much about recording this record was most of the songs are one-takes. We’d start from the top with me singing a melody and building out chords, just me and click track and then my boy John Key on the drums or keys and John Kirby on the synths. I would then go find the best three minutes of the fifteen. I actually tried to recreate some of my vocals, but the energy wasn’t the same and I had to surrender to that. This album isn’t about vocal performance or just words out loud. I tried to create everything I had to say with sonics and frequency. This is really about the way that I feel. Feelings.There is plenty more to say about the album, but it's almost certainly best to hear it in Solange's own words. Read the whole interview over at i-D.

"Vampire Weekend's ""Sunflower"" is the most colorful and kaleidoscopic of the four singles they're released from their forthcoming album Father of the Bride, so it's only fitting that for the video, released today, they went the exact opposite direction. The clip, directed by Jonah Hill, is a tribute to New York City in all its drollness, featuring a straight-faced Ezra Koenig around a handful of the city's staples—the Jewish gourmet Zabar's, as well as an uptown deli, and a grimacing Jerry Seinfeld. That's right, the big comedy man himself shows up to stare into the camera and make kinda pained facial expressions and not really do much else. The camera twists all around and the shots split and everything looks nice. It's great!Steve Lacy, who's featured on the song, also trails Koenig throughout the clip.

Hustlers is set to be Cardi B's first feature film role that follows her appearance starring in Pepsi's 2019 Super Bowl commercial alongside Steve Carrell, Lil Jon, and Monét X Change. The casting fits because before her breakthrough single ""Bodak Yellow"" and 2018 album of the year-contender Invasion of Privacy, Cardi B worked as an exotic dancer at a Manhattan Club. She's talked about the experience in several interviews including a  Cosmopolitan cover story, where she said, ""People say, ‘Why do you always got to say that you used to be a stripper?

It's directed by Mars and his frequent visual collaborator Florent Dechard, which makes a lot of sense, there's this neon camp that seems to follow Mars wherever he goes. It's a bit weird to hear that aesthetic applied to this song—even if it's already in the song itself—there's something about that feels like watching two theater kids dance up on each other.

"Lead image from The Prodigy video ""Firestarter""Keith Flint has died, aged 49. The musician—well known for being the frontman of iconic British band The Prodigy—was found at his home in Dunmow, Essex, on Monday morning according to police reports. His death is not being treated as suspicious. The band, who were due to tour the US in May, shared a statement via Twitter: “It is with deepest shock and sadness that we can confirm the death of our brother and best friend Keith Flint. A true pioneer, innovator and legend. He will be forever missed. We thank you for respecting the privacy of all concerned at this time.” In a post on The Prodigy's Instagram page, the band appeared to confirm that Flint had died by suicide, writing: “The news is true, I can’t believe I’m saying this but our brother Keith took his own life over the weekend.”The Prodigy—one of Britain's most beloved and well-known dance acts—built a name for themselves in the early 1990s, and are largely responsible for pushing rave culture into the mainstream with a string of hits, such as “Firestarter,” “Breathe,” and “Smack My Bitch Up”. Flint in particular was known for his distinctive spiked hair, which would change from slime green to bright pink, energetic performance style and characteristically tireless vocal style. Watch the video for “Firestarter” below.

"On “Movies,” the new song from Weyes Blood released yesterday, Natalie Mering’s mournful alto rings out: “The meaning of life doesn’t seem to shine like that screen.” For many of us, films and TV teach our formative lessons about fundamental aspects of existence—like love, family, and relationships. In doing so, they also set us up for disappointment. Life, after all, is never like the movies. When I met with Mering earlier this year to discuss  Titanic Rising, the upcoming Weyes Blood album on which “Movies” appears, we spoke about how cinema can often sell us lies about how we’re supposed to live, even about our very selves. “When I went through puberty I had a huge rebellion against movies. I was so upset with how they brainwashed me that I didn’t watch movies for years,” she told me. “I couldn’t watch them, I’d just start and be like, ‘This is bullshit. This is not how it is, how dare they make me think that’s how it is?’”These sorts of sentiments seem to inform “Movies” at its heart. Over the course of its five minutes, Mering’s voice—layered and in harmony with itself—pines for the sort of life that media promises us we can all have. “I know the meaning / I know the story / I know the glory / I love movies,” she sings. Even though she acknowledges that Hollywood’s sparkling, dramatic mirages aren’t realistic, it’s not a stretch to see why someone might hope to escape into them as an alternative to reality in all its hardship, as the world burns to ever more noxious ashes. Interestingly, “Movies” feels musically indebted to film, and opens with the sort of electronic oscillations which wouldn’t feel out of place in the background of a scene in a thriller. While her feelings about the ideologies that movies sell us are complex, Mering told me that as both a fan and practitioner of instrumental music, soundtracks are some of her most significant influences. “The only outlet in mainstream culture for classical and more experimental music to be heard is through movie soundtracks, and they’re such a wonderful display of emotion,” she explained. ""I think the guy that did that best is Stanley Kubrick, working with Wendy Carlos who is an electronic composer. I’ve always tried to create music the way Kubrick makes film, just kind of mimicking consciousness. He has a way of mimicking this greater power.”  Over the course of  Titanic Rising—as well as on “Movies” (which, in a very human sense, holds the conflicting viewpoints of knowing that media is lying to us, and to some degree wanting to consume those lies anyway) Mering too echoes consciousness. The album feels like a process of realization; of coming to terms with the fact that the world is as it is, and ending on a note that suggests hope might lie in our relationships with each other. It’s full of interrogations of overarching world issues – climate change, culture as we know it—filtered through Mering’s personal perspective. “I’m always thinking about the bigger picture and always feeling so much for everybody else, and kind of experiencing the pain of the world, personally,"" she explains. ""And so I couldn’t help but to write about these really larger-than-life ideas, but through my personal lens.” Alongside establishing these more straightforward interests, however, Mering ranges into more experimental territory.  Titanic Rising features a number of instrumental tracks, and one of these, the title song, acts as a kind of interlude, sitting between the album’s two halves. She calls it a “separation point, because the first part of the record is more about love and hope, and then we kind of go into more of an existential sub-zone, and the record takes a different turn.” Emotional and sonic nuance is important to this album, and this is most especially reflected in the second half. This is where “Movies” sits, as it grapples with two very human impulses—wanting to reject movies, and wanting to be a part of them—at once. Across this record, Mering acknowledges that being human is a complicated, often tangled-up game. Indeed, even its title,  Titanic Rising, is a contradiction. The Titanic disaster was about something enormous sinking, vanishing from view; but its film adaptation, which Mering is actively referencing here, creates a love story out of tragedy. While this album often feels elegiac, as Mering’s voice looms and languid strings proliferate, it’s ultimately threaded through with hope–with the idea that attempting to understand the world, to accept that this is sometimes not possible, and to love and know each other regardless (as on the fantastic, genuinely Carole King-reminiscent “Picture You Better”). It’s a message which couldn’t really be better timed.

"ScHoolboy Q has been quietly teasing his upcoming fifth studio album ever since the release of his 2016 LP  Blank Face. Though a recent update from his label TDE claimed it was “90 to 95% done,” in September, ScHoolboy announced that “I just don’t feel right putting out an album” following the death of his friend and collaborator Mac Miller. But now, with the release of the ruthless and compelling single “Numb Numb Juice,” the upcoming effort seems imminent. Clocking in at a breathlessly efficient sub-two minute runtime, the new track finds ScHoolboy at his most confrontational. Produced by Nez & Rio, DJ Fu, and Hykeem Carter, “Numb Numb Juice” hits extremely hard with in-your-face programmed drums and a hefty dose of rattling bass. He’s menacing throughout, clowning in the refrain, “Faking like you got it in your pockets, yeah, that's bitch shit / Talking to them hoes, you steady gossip, yeah, that's bitch shit.” Listen to the track below and watch the video, directed by Dave Free and Jack Begert.Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Blank Face', 'Hykeem Carter', 'Dave Free']"
"The Brownsville artist Taphari is well aware he isn't like everyone else. That's sort of just what the world requires of you when you're in a body that exists at the margins of society—people don't let you forget the ways in which you don't fit in. Press materials describe him as a ""loner"" seeking ""asylum"" from these feelings. But he's been talking about this stuff openly for years—his preferred metaphor is the sort of isolation an alien feels in a foreign land. Speaking to THUMP a few years ago, he described how he was starting to express those feelings in his art: ""I sing about how my time amongst humans has left me with a desire for alienation."" He's found occasional refuge, in the underground queer scene in Brooklyn that's always filled with likeminded freaks, but the world occasionally requires you to have interactions outside the community you choose for yourself. ""I step back into the real world and the battle begins again,"" he told the photographer Sam Clarke. ""This is my life and I won't be pacified.""You can sense some of this perspective in the title of his new EP—due March 29—for the New York electronic label Mister Saturday Night. It's called Earth's No Fun, which, in it's own way seems like a way of keeping the world at bay. It's a suggestion that the way he moves through the world can't (and shouldn't) be dictated by society as we know it. Other worlds are possible.That's what his music's been about over the last couple of years, presenting this mystic, unrestrained energy, whether everyone else is ready for it or not. Channelling his history in underground electronics, as well as a childhood love for free-as-fuck musicians like Mary J. Blige and Lil Kim—he's made this take on rap that feels borderless and alien, built around mutating beats and a sort of syllable hopscotch. Today, he's sharing the latest in a string of singles ""Tell Me How,"" which channels that alien approach into a diffident club track. Over a shredded kick drum that'd make Ronny J jealous, Taphari offers this slippery, contorted flow that feels both indebted to uptown fashion raps and the scene in which he found a home. Other pockets of the underground have started calling themselves mutants, but I think Taphari's right to adopt the extraterrestrial energy. Even when he's tackling familiar themes—like if and how one might procure illicit substances—it comes from this perspective that's totally out of this world. There's little else like it.So in advance of Earth's No Fun—available for pre-order now—check out the new single here and appreciate the vision of a truly singular presence.

"Image provided by PRThe darkness, it’s disgusting. Litanies of bad things happen when the lights go out: alien abductions, visits from ghosts, the stubbing of a toe against a bed frame. Mice invasions. From time to time, the sense of being alone, and that you’ll always be alone. Like getting a terminal illness or losing a limb, it really is a sick terror to wake up in the middle of the night in a strange place and to not know where you are, unable to see properly, even if it’s just for a minute or two.But consider this: have you ever truly been in the dark? Between light pollution in big cities and the fading remnants of a phone’s blue light somewhere in the countryside, it feels rare to be properly in the dark. Doing so is absolutely terrifying, though. I know this because my first interview with multi-member group The Hour took place in a pitch-black restaurant, staffed entirely by severely sight impaired waiters. You probably don’t know who The Hour are yet, and that’s OK, because they’re releasing their first official video today. It’s worth getting to know them, though. As introductions go, “Mother” is a bold, impactful entrance. It’s one of those ones where it’s best to dive in and watch the video from start to finish, so why don’t you go ahead and do that now? Kick your feet up and press play.Done? Good. See those people with the masks in the video, stabbing the kitchen table? They’re The Hour. Watching this has the same intense, visceral quality as some of the all time great music videos this side of the century—think: hearing/seeing Tyler the Creator, FKA twigs or The Blaze for the first time, where the combination of visual and sound is so captivating you can’t do anything but watch in awe; where someone’s pulled an original idea out, in a world that seems like it’s done with original ideas. “When you put a mask on, you can do whatever you want… if you all have a mask on, you’re in the same boat,” says one of their members. They say anyone can be in The Hour, however there’s just the one when we meet at the aforementioned dark restaurant, a place called Dans Le Noir in the central London area of Clerkenwell. It’s a pretty fucking strange place for an interview, given that we can’t see each other. For all I know, I’m having fingers stuck up in my face. But The Hour want to do things differently: “It’s all a bit boring doing press,” he says, in a way that feels more light-hearted and welcoming than it should, coming from a guy who wears a mask. “We want to have fun, and make it fun for all of you.”By this point the first course has arrived. I dig into it using my hands, because, well: why eat with a knife and fork when it’s impossible to see anything? I want to touch the food, feel its slime, work out what it is before putting it in my mouth (at first it feels like soft cheese, turns out it’s gross pâté). I start to feel panicked about the fact I can’t see anything, and what it must be like to have your sight and then suddenly lose it. I can just about make out my hand in front of me but only because it’s attached to my body. It’s one of the weirder interviews I’ve done: an experience.Still, The Hour get off on this. The person I’ve come to meet tells me that when they play live— which hasn’t happened yet, but will—they’re going to be doing it in complete darkness, in an underground venue or something, with all the lights turned off. You can imagine health and safety might get in the way but if they pull it off, it’s bound to be a spectacle. Until that happens, though, some immediate facts: They’re signed to FutureKind, the label run by former Dirty Hit exec Chuck Waite and lawyer Laurence Abrahams. If you’re not fully up on who in the industry does what, the label is perhaps more commonly known for its roster of writers—people like Tom Mann (Liam Payne, James TW, Pretty Much), Dan Bartlett (Little Mix, Feder) and Jamie Norton (Take That). Which is to say in some ways it could be seen as a mainstream leaning pop label. However The Hour sees them as the perfect fit. “They let me do things that are out of the box,” this band member says—which is certainly true of this interview.They’ve been around for about a year too, when they dropped a now-deleted video that featured a car being smashed up and a mobile phone number at the bottom. “We text everyone saying meet us at 2PM on D’Arblay Street. Then we hired out a cinema and played some music to people,” they say, of what happened after that video dropped, which was apparently deleted to make way for a fresh start with this release. They’re also going to follow-up this video with a selection of songs under the same title of Mother, which will then be rounded off with a counterpart release—Father. They say there are religious undertones to the project too, though you’ll have to wait for the whole thing to drop to delve deeper into that. For now though, have a go on the video again—it’s one of the more special things released so far in 2019.

"Trudy and The Romance ""Doghouse"" stillFresh off a flight from Austin, Texas, bleary-eyed musician Oliver Taylor steps through the door of his Liverpool home. He answers the phone as he settles in at home, a whirlwind week at SXSW behind him, and admits the whole thing’s a bit hazy. To some extent, though, that’s his own fault. “I was watching too many shit films on the flight, when I should have been sleeping, really,” he says with a laugh. “Rom-coms and that…”It’s perhaps unsurprising to hear that Taylor has a taste for the world of romantic comedy. As frontman of Trudy & The Romance (formerly solo project Trudy, before legal shenanigans forced him to add the fitting suffix), he’s peddled a type of cinematic indie-pop that’s as reliant on those lovelorn tropes as rom-coms themselves. From happiness to heartbreak, and all the way back again, each of Trudy & The Romance’s songs feels like a Richard Curtis vignette, delivered with a doo-wop bounce that wouldn’t feel out of place in a dusty, backwater drive-thru cinema.In one of those so-good-you-couldn’t-write-it coincidences, their first show as the Trudy & The Romance of today fell on Valentine’s Day 2015, Taylor tells me. And this February 14, they played a special show alongside similarly loved-up newcomers Her’s. He laughs when I suggest that they’ve inadvertently begun marking their timeline with Valentine’s Days. “I never really do much for it!” he says of that commercialized excuse for chocolate and flowers. “But yeah—it’s very lovey-dovey! I think it’s a good band for that—for someone to bring their girlfriend or boyfriend too. Have a little swoon.”The swooning, doo-wop vibe of Trudy & The Romance came from Taylor’s obsession with film, first-and-foremost—something you can see in their latest video for ""Doghouse,"" which we're premiering below. “I grew up bingeing films a little too much, I think,” he says. “I write songs in that way—I see them as like a film. Some people see colors and things like that when I write, but I see more of the telling of a story.” That cinematic influence takes more literal forms, too. “The first time I ever saw a guitarist was in  Back To The Future,” he laughs. “When Marty McFly’s shreddin’ it! It’s funny—he does 'Johnny B Goode' and that’s the first song I ever learnt, but then he does 'Earth Angel' as well, which is a doo-wop number. It’s quite a coincidence.”He doesn't just owe his love of doo-wop to Michael J Fox, admittedly—his dad and an old-school friend both played a part in Taylor’s appreciation for the under-represented Americana offshoot. That exposure to a less-known genre that made a mark. “I’ve never really seen myself as having much of a British identity—Union Jack and all that stuff,” he admits, “Most of the films I’ve watched are American, so I’d be proud if it sounded quite American—I think that’d be cool.” He’d love Trudy to make an impact Stateside, though he admits, “I’d probably go mad. Eat too much. All those long drives...”Thankfully, SXSW was a success story. The sound engineers “just seemed to understand it a bit more,” Taylor says, while the crowds appreciated his sweaty, soulful style. “There’s just more of a campness to America, and American music,” he says—something that fits in with the glitz and glamour of Trudy’s own live show. Trudy are a beguiling presence in the flesh, due in no small part to Taylor’s voice—a grizzled croon that he warps by flicking, pulling and shaking his own throat. It’s a cartoonish slant on indie that’s quickly set them apart from others on the UK toilet circuit. “I think the Hard Rock Café sort of vibe—where you’ve got the memorabilia, and it’s very cartoony and kiddy. I think we fit into that, a little bit,” says Taylor.Now, Trudy are readying their debut album  Sandman, a record centered on a tale of lost love and that titular dream-stalking ghoul. Based in part on his first ever teenage love, and in part in the world of filmic fiction that he holds so dear, Taylor’s looking to blur the lines between reality and imagination even further. “Too much is definitely autobiographical,” he says with a laugh. “But it’s definitely over-romanticized. I don’t really dream about the Sandman, but obviously he existed in 'Mr Sandman,'” he adds, referencing The Chordettes’ genre classic. “Which is actually in  Back To The Future as well!”“It’s quite funny,” Taylor notes, “cause in the concept story of the album, the band’s making it really big, and trying to keep it together.” It’s a reference to David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust days, he says—“I just thought it’d be funny to pretend that we’ve made it big!” If this script goes the way it should, they won’t have to pretend for much longer.You can find Tom on Twitter.

"Lizzo: Frazer Harrison/Getty Images for Spotify, Missy Elliott: Erika Goldring/Getty Images""I been waiting for this one,"" Missy Elliott screams at the beginning of ""Tempo,"" Lizzo's new single from her upcoming album Cuz I Love You and to be real, we have too. The energetic collaboration comes ahead of Cuz I Love You 's April 19 release date. ""Slow songs, they for skinny hoes / Can't move all of this here to one of those,"" she raps on the song's frenzied hook. Halfway through the record Elliott enters the track purring through her verse in a way that makes Cardi B's ""okurr"" seem tame.Last month in a Beats 1 interview with Travis Mills, Lizzo shared her vision for her upcoming album (""What if Aretha Franklin made a rap album in 2019?"") and how she got Elliott on ""Tempo.""

""This new one I heard it and I was like this is so obviously Missy,"" Lizzo told Mills. According to Lizzo, it took two months for Elliott to return the track with a verse and the Virginia native did it in an unconventional way. ""She sent me a memoji of herself singing her verse.""

"Screenshot from ""Big Ole Freak""Megan Thee Stallion is everywhere. If you weren't an early fan (she affectionately calls them ""Hotties"") who was privy to her ascent over the last three years, you might have caught her candied visual for her breakthrough single ""Big Ole Freak,"" or rapid-fire freestyle. Whether its for her NSFW lyrics (""I'ma make him wait for the pussy/Hit it til you big ole skeet"") or her natural gift at freestyling, Megan has a chokehold on the conversation. Today, the Houston Hottie is moving past Tina Snow, the mixtape she released last June. ""Sex Talk"" is a little something to hold the Hotties over until Fever, her next project, is released next month. In true stallion fashion, Megan is without restraint. ""Sex Talk"" has a booming production with bass heavy enough to complement Megan's no-nonsense approach to dirty talk. ""You know you need to come give me that dick,"" Megan raps, setting the tone of the song with her opening lines. The lyrics that follow are every bit as explicit as you'd imagine, following the precedent she's set on songs like ""Freak Nasty"" and ""Big Ole Freak."" She sprinkles her God-level adlibs across the track, which are a combination of throaty groans and kissing noises. Before she makes her exit, Megan sets the record straight for the skeptics who think she uses her sexual prowess to trap a man. ""He said, 'Girl, you tryna trap me'/Aww, hell no nigga, no I ain't/You can hit that door,"" she says. ""Sex Talk"" is more evidence that Megan isn't looking to be tamed.Kristin Corry is a staff writer for Noisey.

"“The Loop” is the new LP by Los Angeles based polymath Shafiq Husayn, an epic project which saw its inception in 2012 through a series of studio sessions at Shafiq’s home, including collaborations with the likes of Thundercat, Erykah Badu, Flying Lotus, Bilal and Anderson Paak. Amongst a close knit circle of friends and family the golden tones of “The Loop” were created, deeply rooted in ideas of song, story, history, guidance and spirituality. The album bumps, jumps and jangles through progressions in jazz, hip hop, soul and funk, following on from his debut album ‘Shafiq En’ A-Free-Ka’ and adding further to his rich history of timeless, unique music. On “The Loop” past, present and future are brought together through a psychedelic concoction of time traveling drum machines, celestial string sections and trails of synthesizer vapour. Inflections of Sly Stone, Pharaoh Sanders and Earth Wind And Fire traverse with Marley Marl and Dilla-esqe drums making for an organic yet LA-trifying experience. Shafiq has brought together an impressive array of LA’s musical royalty, enlisting the likes of Thundercat, Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, Kamasi Washington, Chris ‘Daddy’ Dave, Eric Rico, Coultrain, Computer Jay, Jimetta Rose, Om’Mas Keith, Kelsey Gonzalez, I-Ced and more to provide the backbone to his recording sessions. Drawing in features from an international cast of performers and artists like Erykah Badu, Robert Glasper, Hiatus Kaiyote, Fatima and Karen Be amongst others. Now complete and finally ready for release in 2019 “The Loop” is truly something to behold. The records is accompanied by a series of paintings by acclaimed Japanese visual artist Tokio Aoyama, who worked in tandem with Shafiq to create a painting for each song on the record.

"“Guns” is Quelle’s third studio album in three years: each Quelle Chris album is distinct and fully-realized: see 2017’s “Being You Is Great, I Wish I Could Be You More Often,” an off-kilter probe into the ways we see ourselves, or see last year’s collaboration with Jean Grae, “Everything’s Fine“, which was biting satire for the dawn of a new dystopia –– and which was adored by critics, being named to ‘best album of the year’ lists by countless publications, including Pitchfork, The Wire, and Bandcamp, who dubbed it the best album of 2018. Every time a shooting makes the news talking heads pop up in small boxes and make loud arguments about how we shouldn’t rush to politicize what just happened. After all, the heads argue, guns don’t kill people. People kill people. But how true is that? Are the tools we use simply tools, innocuous until we give them meaning? Or are the things we surround ourselves with –– the things in our arsenal –– begging to be weaponized, for good or for evil? Guns, the new album from the critically acclaimed rapper and producer Quelle Chris, is a careful study of all these questions, an urgent record for urgent times. “Guns is an arsenal of both sounds, styles, and subjects, Quelle says, taking a thorough look at “the words we say, what we fear, how we love, how we live, what we ingest, what we believe in, who we idolize, shit like that.” To this end, the New York by-way-of Detroit savant attacks his topics from multiple angles: there’s the jagged, minimal “Obamacare,” which plays like a confrontation, but there’s also “Wild Minks,” where Quelle and the enigmatic New Jersey rapper Mach-Hommy spin silk out of the softest textures in their parents’ record collections. In the service of examining big ideas with grave consequences, we get to hear a master technician deploying every piece of ammo he has. In times that are often beyond parody, Quelle has never been a writer to shy away from the absurd. But Guns is dotted with references to the very real, painfully ordinary fates that might befall us –– be they getting gunned down in church on a Sunday or simply being forgotten by our friends after we’re gone. In preparation for both, Quelle lays his psyche bare. Maybe his identity is best summed up by the three-word descriptor he gives himself toward the record’s end: “handsome, black, and headstrong.” Quelle handles the vast majority of production duties himself, with assists coming from Dane and Chris Keys. Guns covers sonic ground quickly: it opens with the skeletal creep of “Spray & Pray” and closes with “WYRM,” which is sweeping and contemplative. In between there are detours to the lush and playful (“PSA Drugfest 2003”) and to the grim and digital (“Mind Ya Bidness”). As always, Quelle delivers music that’s innovative and idiosyncratic without sacrificing the gut-punch of more commercial releases; in fact, there are moments when Guns rattles trunks like few rap LPs in recent memory. “Guns” is slated for release via Mello Music Group on March 29",articles24,"['Quelle’s', 'Jean Grae', 'Pitchfork', 'The Wire', 'Quelle', 'Quelle', 'Drugfest']"
"The journey of “A Quest Called Tribe” was birthed through a series of portraits drawn by Stéphane Carricondo in 2017, dedicated to the hip hop luminaries. As a partner in the arts, Medline proposed to create a soundtrack accompanying the portraits, interpreting ATCQ’s classics through the past, present and future influences. On the visual side: Stéphane Carricondo’s natural lines highlight each member’s soul map. The alchemy of the dark ink on emptiness gives them an impressive sparkle of life. On the musical side: The classic themes are transformed into a polymorphic fusion, where jazz, funk and soul from the original sample sources converse with Tribe’s characteristic beats. Medline added his own littlemagic – unique rhythms, improvisations, arrangements, original orchestration and inspired melodies. The album is an ode to the band, an as Elton John referred to them; “the seminal hip-hop band of all time.”",articles24,"['ATCQ’s', 'Tribe’s']"

"After announcing his hiatus from the music world last November, international DJ and producer Carnage is back! The Heavyweight Records founder (real name Diamanté Anthony Blackmon) will embark on a run of global dates aptly titled ‘The Reincarnation Tour’.In a powerful op-ed on Billboard, Carnage cites the untimely deaths of his good friends Avicii and Mac Miller as a major factor in his own decision to take some time out of the spotlight.“I needed to take time to think about what is truly important to me,” Carnage reflects. “I needed to slow it all down and really focus my life and career. It is not easy to share, but I desperately needed a reset.”Carnage’s 2019 revival sees the trap titan approach his work with a brand new and re-energized vigor. Kicking off at SXSW with another edition of Heavyweight Royal Rumble on March 15th, Carnage will return to Los Angeles that night for his eagerly anticipated headline show at Exchange.Partnering with the iconic Los Angeles-based soul food restaurant Roscoe’s House of Chicken and Waffles, Carnage will be hosting a unique pop-up experience for fans. From 10pm to midnight, each ticket holder to the Friday, March 15th Exchange show will receive free Roscoe’s at the venue.Joining the billing for Insomniac’s Beyond Wonderland festival in March, Carnage will also take part in Miami Music Week, before heading to Europe for a run of shows across spring/summer.A true giant of the music industry, Carnage has racked up hundreds of millions of streams across his platinum-selling hits, scoring widespread acclaim on his two studio albums, Papi Gordo (2015), and Battered, Bruised & Bloody (2018). Collaborating with the likes of G-Eazy, Lil Pump, Migos, Steve Aoki, KSHMR, Timmy Trumpet, and many more, Carnage has also proved his hand as a remixer, including his infamous rework of Hardwell’s hit “Spaceman”.Known for his explosive live shows, Carnage has delivered his unrivaled energy to many of the world’s biggest festivals, including Coachella, EDC Las Vegas, Tomorrowland, and Ultra Music Festival in Miami, where he was joined on stage by DJ Khaled, Rae Sremmurd, Wiz Khalifa, and Rick Ross.After taking time off to recharge, travel, and spend time with family, Carnage is ready to unveil a new era of music to his fans. “I worked on music in a way I never had before,” he says on Billboard. “For the first time in as long as I can remember, I was making music that meant something to me. I was not trying to make hits. My new music is unlike anything I’ve ever made…it has real emotion.”As a proud immigrant, Carnage is also prepared to tackle issues facing the world today: “I am going to use my platform to be a better role model and help all immigrants like me achieve success. You’re going to see a difference in me and I can’t wait for the ride to come.”Full details of ‘The Reincarnation Tour’ can be found below, with tickets available at www.papigordo.com (featuring Steve Aoki, Borgore, 6ix9ine, and many more), “El Diablo” is available worldwide now.Carnage: FacebookAfter two exceptional albums, a recent sold-out UK tour, multiple Top 10 records and the success of his recent Radio […]Copyright © 2019 | HousePlanet.DJ ",articles19,"['Carnage', 'Carnage', 'Carnage', 'Carnage', 'Carnage', 'Papi Gordo', 'G-Eazy', 'Lil Pump', 'Steve Aoki', 'KSHMR', 'Timmy Trumpet', 'Carnage', 'Carnage', 'Rick Ross', 'Carnage', 'Carnage', '”Full']"
"I recently had the immense pleasure of listening to the second release on Touched Electronix TE002 and amongst it was an incredibly well-placed track that I kept coming back to time and time again. “Zola” provided rich noise and a rising happiness that lifted my day, allowing me to truly escape from what was happening around me and forget, even if it was just for a few minutes. Luckily for me the artist responsible—Pushkin—has showcased another bunch of his talent on Touched Music and I couldn’t be more pleased.I almost don’t realize the album is playing, the introduction is slow, its exact beginning hard to pinpoint but once it’s there it’s unmistakably there. Distant transit samples give way to an ambience you’ve heard before, but also never heard. Pushkin has taken the deceptively-simple constructs of ambient electronica and pieced them together for an incredibly nostalgic feel.Tracks one to five feel like a mix tape, the kind you’d make for someone whose attention you were trying to get. If you’re not listening to this on physical media then you’d better be sure to get hold of a media player that can handle gapless-playback—it’s a delight to listen to a release as seamless as this. Even within tracks it auditions like different songs, stems intertwined here and there and by the time “Lounge” hits, I know this would be enough to keep any dance floor in motion. “Alien Highway” feels very 90s and I can’t help but think of “Higher State Of Consciousness” (Josh Wink) throughout its first half, but without the silly trance-craze that left the aforementioned-track occasionally unbearable. This is stripped back, laid bare & exactly what you need to twist and groove. Yet again we are treated to passages and phrases with “The Sun Came Out” that feel so incredibly familiar that this is just like putting on a CD that I listened to a hundred times as a teenager but forgotten about, much to my detriment. And then comes “Zola” again. Even appearing so recently on TE002 the track stands out, listening to it in this sequence shows it in a completely different light and it’s almost as if the whole release has been building up to these seven minutes.The second half of the album changes gear so quickly that it’s almost hard to remember what I was just listening to, it’s crazy-good that I’m being pushed forward like this. You reach a point of no return and there’s no option but to continue. Each of the last-five tracks hold their own, there’s some bleed between them but they are very much their own pieces in contrast to the beginning of this experience. Tempos slow yet fast, lush pads and pensive transitions really reinforce the early-feel of this collection. “Numbers” really gets to me, it’s haunting and just makes me want to close my eyes, reminiscent of Abigail Mead’s epic work on the Full Metal Jacket soundtrack. Something about it unnerves me but I can’t stop listening. The shift to the final track “Departed” is fluid and subtle, a welcome nod to the first five.Overall I’ve had a lot of fun with this release. Hats off to Pushkin—he’s really solidified some great techniques and presented something truly beautiful, worthy of a place in anybody’s collection if they really care about electronic music.Sertra Line is available on Touched Music.Sertra Line by Pushkin",articles20,"['Luckily', 'Pushkin', 'Pushkin', 'Pushkin', 'Pushkin']"
"Kyle Bobby Dunn dials in From Here to Eternity, an (even more) extended (4LP/3CD) set of doleful elegies and intense drone-hymns. A half-decade hiatus–from …the Infinite Sadness (Students of Decay, 2014), after Low Point high points, A Young Person’s Guide to… (2010) and Bring Me the Head of… (2012), with Ways of Meaning (Desire Path, 2011) between—may suggest a difficult gestation, but there’s no trace of a blockage here. Au contraire, his penchant for the plangent plumbs previously unsounded depths—of a density and portent hitherto unvoiced by this somewhat reluctant leading light in a millennial wave of ambient drone.Evidently wanting to go further than …the Infinite Sadness, he co-opted a handful of drone homies, including Benoît Pioulard, Simon Scott, Loscil, Wayne Robert Thomas, Mark Nelson and Robert Donne, to outdo what was Dunn—to document no less than ‘the eternal conflict with all human emotions and life circumstances.’ The opening “Preludium Aeterna” sets the tone with a sequence of gradualist arcs of timbres shivering in mesmeric motion. Moods and sounds resound, from angelic chorale to soundtrack epic, with a sense of boundaries and mortality. Chronostasis and ecstasis take turns to tend to tones, languorously looping them through deceptively evacuated zones, rendering them replete with detail. Finding a (sad-)happy medium between small-scale elegiacs and more plumped-up micro-orchestral maneuvers, space for bright breakthrough within doleful dalliance. It’s the Dunn thing.‘It’s about this place in North Montreal where I’d go to escape […] It’s incredibly beautiful, but it also filled me with hopelessness and a sense of unease. A lot of the tracks might do that to the listener,’ he says (self-titled) in re: “Boul. Gouin,” one of a set exploring ‘the general feeling of malaise many people are experiencing right now,’ mordantly on later pieces like the blackened “Dead Calm (Southcentre Suite).” His palette, with its signature stretched sustains and textural micro-variations, saturated like an instrumentalist analog to BoC‘s synth-y wow’n’flutter warble, but with a change of voice, center stage and in the margins; as in the archness of ‘reflecting heavily on the gorgeous feet of a certain French woman and binging on strong beers and cheese’ (here) turning to the earnest ‘Truly a difficult album of unending loss, confusion, pain, identity, disease and even death.’ And more…‘It’s about what I see my life being, maybe what I see all of us being. I feel like I see more evil now than ever, and find it all so terrifying. So I’ve been searching for a sense of peace or calm, but am terrified of that as well.’If the swollen trajectory From Here to Eternity threatens with pacific petrification, there’s a whole Weltschmerz in microcosm in the intense finale of “Eternity, the Stars & You.” It sees the numbness of Infinite Sadness cede to the peace and terror of Eternity. And the day of Dunn’s drollery done.From Here to Eternity is out now [digital] and in May [vinyl] on Past Inside the Present, which offers an array of possible formats—and some impossible (sold out).",articles20,"['…', '…', 'Simon Scott', 'Wayne Robert Thomas', 'Mark Nelson', 'Robert Donne', 'Aeterna', '…', 'Infinite Sadness', 'Eternity', 'Eternity']"
"Nimon is a one man guitar ambient music project with a solid background in the world of edition thanks to a number of publications on the legendary Ant-Zen indie label (which has powerfully excelled in the diffusion of experimental, noise, and adventurous electroacoustic soundscapes since a few decades). In this new effort Keef Baker delivers achingly emotional, slow and heavily processed e-guitar reveries. With a slippery touch, plenty of subtle moves and glimmering drones guide the listener in a vast and deep bath of plenitude and inner quietness. The textures are densely layered, poignant, resonating to the confins. This album features enough sonic ingredients, a variety of timbres, and convincing compositional schemas to avoid falling in the trap of functional or softly-moving new-age quiescence. It pushes the whole cinematic soundscapes to a higher level of personal introspection—rhe slightly melodic nature also includes fragile and progressing melancholic airs.All in all The Slow Atrophy of Hope is a vividly imaginative, organic, and icy ambient album mainly built on flexible guitar drones, detached eerie patterns and reverberant contemplative clouds of sounds. One blissful release that is greatly recommended for fans of early works by Eluvium, Loscil, Aidan Baker, Machinefabriek, Tim Hecker, as well as any relevant recorded material in touch with guitar-centric droning tones. As most of the works published under the Nimon moniker, this new effort should not be missed.The Slow Atrophy of Hope is available on Bandcamp.The Slow Atrophy of Hope by Nimon",articles20,"['Keef Baker', 'Aidan Baker', 'Tim Hecker']"
"If you would like to embark on a trek through the stillness of night from the comfort of your mind, wandering planes softly lit by a gentle aurora, Russ Young’s new EP Pala is the perfect pairing. A four-track ambient gem from the independent UK artist released on Audiobulb, the contribution marks his second commercial release and illustrates Young’s intuitive approach to the genre. His method is one of microsound collaging which when assembled produces a harmonious whole greater than the sum of its parts.The first track “Polaris” swells subconsciously with atmosphere, a placid subtly expressive berceuse with simple and reverberating piano plucks in the midst of distant air. “Cavern” leads the listener through an opening of pure bass tone gently tunneling downward. In this piece woodwind sounds present themselves and then disintegrate, tucking away while minimal chimes ever so lightly glint atop the deep-rooted drone. What follows is the track really at the center of the Earth. It’s easy to picture walking alongside stalagmites and witnessing small geysers let off subterranean steam when listening to “Pourous.” Finally, “The Blue Air” brings forth emergence from the underground odyssey, a breath of fresh air, daylight, and with it a renewed sense of appreciation and meaning.The experience Russ Young’s music captures here is personally settling. It’s akin to viewing the wonders of the world in solitary and being rewarded by the universe revealing itself to you as your companion. His technique and decided moments for the instrumentation he employs here is tasteful, complimented by balanced mastering from notable electronic musician Taylor Deupree. A relaxing and most enjoyable listen.Pala is available on Audiobulb.Pala (EP) by Russ Young",articles20,"['Russ Young', 'Young’s', 'Russ Young', 'Taylor Deupree', 'Pala']"
"A lot of people complain about the fact that local artists never get a fair shake in their own town, so often taken for granted. These days, when I think about all the times I heard about a Nash The Slash show happening—at some little bar in Toronto throughout the ‘90s and early 2000s—and all the times I never bothered to show up, it really does hit that point home. He passed away in 2014, so I clearly missed that boat, and I truly regret that.I’ve been paying close attention to the progress of a new, locally produced documentary about Nash The Slash: And You Thought You Were Normal has been in production since 2016, by some friends of mine, and the more I’ve been seeing and hearing of Nash The Slash, the more fascinated I’ve become. He was one of the first Canadian artists to make electronics and drum machines front and center in his music, and on that point alone he is someone who deserves my respect for paving the way.To get some insight into the Toronto scene that Nash The Slash came up in, just before hitting a brief stint of fame as Gary Numan’s go-to opening act and player on some of his classic early ‘80s albums, I ran some questions by Colin Brunton. Colin was a close personal friend of Nash’s, who went on to have a successful career in film and television, including director/producer credits on cult film classics The Last Pogo, Highway 61, Roadkill, and Headwig and the Angry Inch. He’s also recently signed on as Executive Producer for And You Thought You Were Normal.Jason Amm :: Could you describe the The Original 99 Cent Roxy Theatre – what it was, the scene surrounding it, and how Nash The Slash fit into it?Colin Brunton :: In ’73, when I was 17, I was an usher at The Original 99 Cent Roxy. It was the hippest joint in town. It had a reputation as the theatre in Toronto where you could openly smoke dope, but it was also where Gary Topp, who was the brains behind it, turned Toronto onto an eclectic program of movies. Two different movies a night, everything from European art films to avant-garde artists like Warhol and Anger to B-movies, musicals, what have you. And Gary would play the best music between shows. He turned us all on to bands no one had heard of, like Roxy Music, Sun Ra, Be Bop Deluxe, Little Feat, and on and on. It was my film school, my music school, my sociology class. I was hanging out with all these cool people who were older and wiser and hipper than I could dream of, including Jeff Plewman (aka Nash The Slash). He was in the band Breathless then; they did a concert at the Roxy that was fantastic. A few years later he created his Nash The Slash persona (Gary Topp and him came up with the name) and made his debut at the Roxy performing a live soundtrack to the Dali/Buñuel short film Un Chien Andalou. People were gob-smacked. No one had seen anything like this before. He used tape-loops that he created while he played. He used a then almost unheard of drum machine. He created all this live, and it sounded huge. People were absolutely mesmerized.Jason :: Nash The Slash was a fixture in Toronto’s alternative scene in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, and so were you. How did Nash The Slash fit into the scene, and in what ways did he seem to be an outsider?Colin :: I wasn’t so much a fixture as I was simply present, and got some notoriety when I made my short film The Last Pogo. Nash fit into the scene because he was such a DIY guy, an ethos of the punk scene, and he hated the establishment, and he was just so fucking cool. When the musicians union told him that drum machines were illegal, he got around that rule by arguing that he wasn’t a musician at all: he was a performance artist. That’s pretty brilliant. And he was such a great showman.The fact that he hid his identity so well gave him that outsider vibe. Not a lot of people knew who he was, and he hated it if you called him “Nash” when he was off stage. He was very good at maintaining his mystique. Even now, you could find maybe three photos of him on the Internet without his bandages on. He relished the mystery and didn’t dissuade any of the many rumors of his true identity. For a while there, some people thought Nash was actually Anne Murray.Jason :: Although Nash The Slash was naturally adopted by Toronto’s punk scene, a lot of things about his music seem at odds with punk: the electronics, his prog-rock background with FM… You included Nash The Slash in your definitive Toronto punk documentary The Last Pogo Jumps Again—do you consider Nash The Slash punk?Colin :: He’s was much punk as Beethoven was, or Picasso, or the Ramones. It’s was all about attitude. I never really thought of his music as prog-rock.Jason :: What would you say were Nash’s most innovative, and most unique, contributions to music – at the time, and now, in retrospect?Colin :: Again, when he made his debut with Un Chien Andalou, not many people knew how he was actually doing it. And he was very bright, and could just get so excited about ideas. He thought he could be not just the best rock band in North America, he thought he could be the only rock band in North America. Even with Breathless he was innovative. You just didn’t see anyone playing a violin in those days, let alone setting it on fire, and pumping the sound through what looked like a ’30’s art deco radio console. Most bands around ’73 were still in blue jeans and t-shirts, and this guy was wearing a top-hat and formal wear. He looked different. He sounded different. He was totally ahead of his time. And you can still listen to his music over forty years later, and imagine it being some kid locked in his home-studio with his computer. But of course, in the early/mid-seventies, there were no such things.Jason :: Your professional relationship with Nash The Slash continued well past his professional heyday, enlisting him for soundtrack work in the 1991 cult classic film that you produced, Highway 61. What made you think of Nash The Slash for soundtrack?Colin :: I wanted to use him for virtually every film I produced. It started with my short A Trip Around Lake Ontario, and then the features Roadkill and Highway 61. When I was exec-producing features at Norman Jewison’s Canadian Film Centre, I wanted him to do the score for all five films I did there, but only the Blood & Donuts team were into it. He would have done such a great job on Cube, but the director had someone else in mind. He was always my go-to guy for music. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of both film and film scoring and could do it in any style: Lake Ontario was synth; Roadkill was mostly harmonica; Highway 61, big band and orchestral; Blood & Donuts synth and orchestral. When I left the Film Centre in ’92 I became mostly a hired-gun and didn’t have the pull any more to get him gigs on films and TV shows.Jason :: How would you describe your friendship with the man behind the bandages? What kind of a person was he?Colin :: He was funny, excitable, interesting. He had a ferocious temper, but luckily I was never on the wrong end of it. We had a shared love of pinball and pot. And he, along with Gary Topp, were big influences on me, as I got through my teenage years and early twenties, trying to achieve this impossible dream of making films. He was always very encouragingJason :: How do you think that Nash The Slash would feel about his sexuality being a topic in the documentary? Do you think that he was ever comfortable with the public knowing that he was gay?Colin :: It wasn’t something I ever spoke to him about. To be honest, I’m not even sure he’d want that to be in this movie.

"Clarian is an accomplished time traveler. If this was ever in question regarding the intrepid music producer and science fiction fan, his new EP Time Safari is the resounding answer. Released on Kompakt, the four track is an imaginative, detailed, and beautifully executed journey of layered groove. Through the use of pulsing drum machines and arpeggiated synths (at times marimba-like), along with transformed field recordings and effected vocal narration, he provides an anthropological experience through the lens of a person from the future. In analog glory, the EP harkens the primordial rhythms of life and before you can realize it, you’re instinctively bobbing your head or moving your body.The album’s title track possesses a shadowy cyber discotheque vibe as you enter into the sonic world he’s created. From there “Ancient Cave” continues to carry you with a steady beat and subtle pads underneath a progressive and colorful arp. Then onward to “Early Life,” a track that finds you surveying the plains millions of years ago, as if you’re witnessing the myriad and rapidity of expanding biological life right in your visage. Of course, this is all only possible to you because of your guide and through the impulsively danceable music which serves as the vessel to transport you.Experientially reminiscent of the decommissioned Disney attractions “Adventure Through Inner Space,” “Mission to Mars,” or even the original “Submarine Ride,” this all becomes fully transparent on the EP’s final track, a nearly 23-minute-long and different ambient version of “Time Safari” where the spoken narration is more audible and documents this scientific traverse through the history of existence. At one point a parallel is drawn between the similarities of human DNA and that of a sea urchin, “floating listlessly in a still pool” while Clarian records the sound of it. A fascinating listen and auditory odyssey of the mind, Time Safari is—hands down—one of the best electronic EPs of the year.Time Safari is available on KompaktTime Safari by Clarian",articles20,"['Early Life', 'DNA']"
"[Press-Release] According to Brooklyn-based art blog Hyperallergic, opaque couché wins “the title of ‘World’s Ugliest Color.” So why did Meat Beat Manifesto (MBM) name its new album Opaque Couché? “I wanted to do a title based around a particular color, so I wanted to give opaque couché a chance since it’s not black or white,” explains MBM mastermind Jack Dangers.Out on May 10, 2019 on Flexidisc via Virtual Label in LP, CD, and digital formats, it will also be released as a limited edition of 300 in conjunction with UK magazine Electronic Sound on especially-ugly colored vinyl (in opague couché!). This limited edition vinyl will also be available at meatbeatmanifesto.com.Opaque Couché finds the seminal electronic band in a mischievous, rhythm-based mood, recalling some of the band’s groundbreaking early work while still stretching modern boundaries. “I wanted to go back to my roots and reinvent it,” says Dangers—and reinvent he does!Kicking off with the ominous and resounding “Untroduction,” MBM explores rhythm and melody throughout its 16 tracks. Bending sounds, textures and voices, he juggles beats and notes with solid precision. With its syncopated percussive breakbeats amidst a deep bass groove and Danger’s caustic vocals interspersed throughout, “Pin Drop” (which premieres today via FLOOD Magazine) is anything but its namesake. In a related vein, “No Design” distills the breakbeats and changes it up, transforming it into a whole new experience. ““Pin Drop” and “No Design,” to my knowledge, are new sonic explorations,” Dangers says about the two tracks. “I am using familiar breakbeats but manipulating them into something new. Familiar breaks in unfamiliar places.”The atmospheric “Hailing Frequencies Open” comes across as a paranoid nighttime stroll through a forest made of wind chimes and tubular bells. The mechanized percolations of “Call Sign” teeter and balance with prolonged textured notes, perfectly displaying MBM’s mastery of staccato and sustain. The mesmerizing and hypnotic “Ear Lips” captures Dangers at his most playful, manipulating his vocals into almost absurdist interplay. The vocal line is “a manipulation of my voice reciting lyrics which you should not be able to recognize. It’s not supposed to be recognizable text or syntax,” he explains. ““Ear Lips” is the story of my life.” The album ends where it began—in an ominous and expansive soundscape with “Wandering Soul,” bookending the breakbeats and masterful sound manipulations.MBM’s consistent musical invention has led to all forms of electronic musical experimentation over its 31 year history, from jungle to techno to industrial to dubstep to jazz fusion. Future live dates will explore and re-examine MBM’s long string of influential futuristic classics including such groundbreaking tracks as “God O.D.,” “Drop,” “Helter Skelter,” “Radio Babylon,” “Edge of No Control,” to “It’s The Music.” The single, “Prime Audio Soup” (from the album Actual Sounds and Voices) was prominently featured in the sci-fi fantasy blockbuster The Matrix and on its platinum-selling soundtrack.An acknowledged and celebrated innovator in the electronic music scene (his remix of Tower of Power’s “What Is Hip?” was nominated for a Grammy in 2006), Jack Dangers continues to stretch sonic boundaries and influence new generations of sound activists. As a premiere remixer, producer and sound designer, he has played a seminal role in defining tomorrows’ music today. Past production/remixing/collaboration include: Public Enemy, David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, The Orb, David Byrne, Depeche Mode, Terry Riley, Coil and Tower of Power.Now with a new album and live shows to be announced (MBM wrapped up a headlining spot in the Summer of 2018 on the electronic and industrial festival Cold Waves), Meat Beat Manifesto isn’t keeping still. “I have a couple new projects—The JDs and working with Adi Newton from The AntiGroup/Clock DVA,” he says about his multiple current projects. “We will likely be doing some more live shows as well marking 32 years of MBM and 30 years of live shows in the US.”Opaque Couché is available on Flexidisc via Virtual Label May 10, 2019.

"Greg Schappert returns to Subapical. The New Yorker opened the label’s doors back in 2017 under his SC-164 moniker, the darkened moods of Eastern District blackening speakers with angular shadows and audible menace. Now the Brooklyn musician is back, this time with five tracks for Transmitter Park.“Past Dues” groans. Pressure and tension combine in this ambient introduction, a prologue of what is to come. The curiously titled “Walker’s Rights” follows. Terse drum patterns give way to smoke shrouded synths. Blurred in a haze, the track resonates and rumbles with a visceral energy as notes hover without ever making their true intent known. Schappert draws on the world of engines and motors for his influences, the clank of the assembly line and the cut of metal. This inspiration is plain to hear in the low growl underlying “Divide.” Above this hum spike slender shards of snare, a rhythm only being established near the half way point. The track is a strange sculpture, one that bulges and breaks into serrated shapes and forms. Despite the solitary nature of SC-164’s sound, there is a human quality behind his compositions. The machine is central, yes, but the man of the formula is far from hiding. The bass and rhythmic cracks of “Soles Walk” call on the sweat and stains of the club. Brooding, the B-Side opener boils under immense strain as an eerie lingering electro line haunts. The close comes with the ominously titled “Assault on Your Assembly.” Pincered percussion slices from the offset, razor edges lasers into lancing points. As in the previous pieces, the melody only unfolds beyond the midway point and reveals itself as a juddering shuddering bulwark of static and string.Transmitter Park journeys a similar path to past SC-164 productions, the grit and gristle of industrial abandonment and the hollowing out of the human experience. This path is one of dark oblongs and inchoate polygons, of heaped tension and palpable paranoia. However, within these shades and shadows, these inked hues, lies a new hopefulness and, dare it be said, an optimism turned and spun in smooth aluminum and rough steel.Transmitter Park is available on Subapical.[SUBAPICAL04] SC-164 – Transmitter Park by SC-164",articles20,['Pressure']

"Carbinax continues to expand the experimental electronic horizon, offering his latest assemblage Above And Beyond—a hefty 26-track album and remix collection spread across 2-CDs that has been in constant rotation around these parts. Carbinax shows no signs of slowing down—and just when I thought there would be a plateau, the Belfast artist (formerly known as 2ndMouse until 2016) continues to ascend with sonic vigor.And yet it’s difficult not to hear parallels as Carbinax crafts brightly colored, next-level glitch/IDM landscapes that are upbeat, enlightening, and highly contagious. These parallels merge the now classic melodic tenancies of Plaid with the percussive punctuation of Brothomstates and Funckarma from the early 2000s. Not only that, but Plaid also happen to deliver a remix of the already excellent (and personal favorite) “Tiger By The Tail” via a drone-infested alteration. Almost as if not sure what to do with the original—and perfectly executed—electronic slice of life, Ed and Andy stretch “Tiger By The Tail” through a wall of sweet noise, the original musical strands slowly dissolving, and yet it remains a baffling audio collage. Tracks like “Walking In My Shoes,” “Fracture,” “High Jinx” (as well as the powerful abstract-glitch-electro version by Humanoid), and the Carbinax remixes tend to make this collection a mind-bending voyage that never seems to end. Not to mention the stellar remixes by Dn Fnckn (of Funckarma), Monoform, and Weld—Above And Beyond is an aptly-titled release that baffles and delivers on all fronts. The unique, hard-hitting range of (e)motion supersedes expectation as Carbinax one-ups himself with each release.There are just so many highlights to expound upon, that it’s probably best to simply head over to the Bandcamp page and enjoy the music (or purchase its limited to 100 DVD-CD package) for yourself!Above And Beyond is available on Touched Music.Above & Beyond by CarbinaxAbove & Beyond by CarbinaxAbove & Beyond by Carbinax",articles20,"['Brothomstates', 'Funckarma', 'Ed and', 'Tiger By The Tail', 'Humanoid', 'Funckarma', 'Above & Beyond', 'CarbinaxAbove & Beyond']"
"William Basinski‘s latest outing, On Time Out of Time, is a suite of works commissioned for the ‘ER=EPR’ and ‘Orbihedron’ installations by Evelina Domnitch and Dmitry Gelfand for the Limits of Knowing exhibition at Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin. Not one for small gestures, Basinski takes recordings made with the Interferometers of LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) at MIT capturing the sound of the merging of two distant massive black holes 1.3 billion years ago, and turns them into two pieces of  musical mesmerism; the 40-minute title track not yet with us, the more concise and consonant “4(E+D)4(ER=EPR),” nine minutes of a live track drawn from said installation, serves as a compelling teaser. While we’re ‘here,’ lest we forget Selva Oscura, wherein Bill shacks up with Larry for the first fruit of a half-decade’s communing. The reference to Dante’s Inferno (Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita mi ritrovai per una selva oscura, ché la diritta via era smarrita—Midway through the journey of our life I found myself in a forest dark, for the direct path had been lost) may bespeak topographic and temporal displacement, mirrored in its alien drift, but also serves as a signifier of the serendipity of Basinski’s encounters with English over the years. Outcome of a deconstructed sonic palette, magnified and inverted from macro to micro and back again, via a shuttle of files between LA and Brisbane, it sweeps over vast tracts of shifting terrain, sounds constantly granularly re-arranged to render a broader tapestry of glacial narcosis, two extended pieces mapping an acoustic territory drawing on the concept of the strange-familiar drift in a shifting, yet constant state of unfolding. Temporary Residence hosts.Having closed in on end-of-year fecund as ever with the elegantly designed detritus of Falling from Mind over MIDI and Andrew Sherwell’s mighty murky Ektenia, Shimmering Moods saw it out with Olan Mill and Sounds of a New Father, inelegantly billed as ‘a paean to the whole baby-sleep thing’ (note: along with variations on the letter H, this is Alex Smalley’s last release as Olan Mill, a body of work stretching back 7 years or so) and Thet Liturgiske Owäsendet with Novemberregn, recorded live with minimal editing, ‘eight tracks of beautiful, contemplative, Autumnal melancholy, of memories of what we have had and lost, and thoughts on what might yet come to pass,’ and more from the mopey Muse of Paw Grabowski, adding to his burgeoning øjeRum catalog with A Certain Grief. Never-sleeping SM sees in 2019, ironically, with Music For Sleep and Andrea Porcu mixing harmonic resonance with subtle drone over deep water explorations on Waterforms, a long-form piece that purportedly, when listened to with a certain attention, ‘will transport you to another dimension, without moving from your chair.’ That’s this year’s holiday sorted, budget intact. Similarly inclined to the more auditory end of SM’s ambit is Silent Odes from so-called ‘Afro diaspora artist,’ Luna Monk, ‘launching various emotions on various objects to transmit waves and messages from the Afro space age,’ made of captures from Welsh valleys and the Lake District—the naturalistic flow of water, hymns, and other peaceful explorations under gentle mesmeric melodies. And finally, Purl & Yamaoka (Ludvig Cimbrelius and Kenichi Oka) make Sculpture out of arrays of hazy pianoid tinkle and diverse ambient textures, along with more beaty reflections like “Jaiburo.” Philippe Blache is all over this with his own igloo-’view too.Ex Confusion: not perhaps a name that resonates, though the sound—lone guitar via analog gear with modern FX to glaze/gauze—certainly does. And previous on U-Cover, Rural Colours, Plancha, and Orchid Tapes, two n5md albums, Embrace and With Love, and a handful of comp contributions, notably …And Darkness Came and For Nihon and a near-decade of operations show this Tokyo Joe—Atsuhito, actually—is no tyro. For his latest, I Remember When, another in Ambient music’s fat file of fixation with memory, he layers altered guitar into remote shimmering arcs; like the slow fade of image-music-text captured on ageing media carriers, it bespeaks transience. From the abrasive “Forgiveness” through the lachrymose “Tears” to the disintegrative “She Waited For You,” always returning, no drone left unturned. A communion with fellow nostalgia-phile, Benoît Pioulard, “I Owe The Earth A Body,” is all semiotic swirls coalescing and dissipating. “What I Miss Most” delicately smears into “Your Touch” in a washed-out sustain-release blur for a heartstring-tug coda.Black Swan with more ‘drones for bleeding hearts,’ as the somewhat knowing byline goes, in the form of The Sentimental Drift. The opening “Birth” sets a keynote with a warm amniotic tenor that intensifies the deeper it goes, a tenebrous tinge late in the day. Sonic fragments display incipient traces of decay in front of us, bridging a chasm between harmony and the destruction of that harmony. The reels go round, spooling out a series of somber melodic veils with long delay tails and echo trails. BS conducts his ethereal symphony with a shadowy gravitas, musical and emotional, though contrasting with the more aloof tenor of some of his discography. The music grows, lows, ascends and bends towards the light till the finale, the 17-minute abyssal plunge of “The Black Room,” descends ever deeper through swathes of shifting clouds.Lest we forget, from late last year came Slow spark, soft spoke extended vinyl edition courtesy of cute boutique-y Belgians at Dauw. History? Fresh from The Benoît Pioulard Listening Matter (Kranky, 2016), the artist known as Benoît Pioulard left for Europe to promote said album, a tour taking him to places ranging from urban Brussels to rural France and the remote Reykjavik. Once returned to Seattle, these impressions and memories provided food for musical thought, yielding Ss, ss. Initially released on tape, it flew off the Dauw shelves, prompting a raft of re-issue requests, leading to this vinyl repress. In a vein akin to his Lignin Poise (vinyl re-press by Beacon Sound), swathes and smears of slow-mo guitar map emotional oceanism in lo-fi tones, flooded with tape saturated simulacra of distant waves. Gorgeous sad-happy narratives sonified with slender means. Come-on in the form of two bijou newies presented as a single, Athanasy, 1993, amplifies the siren lure of its winsome warble and wooze.Across the late ’00s, the blurb story goes, a series of ambient recordings from Tomasz Bednarczyk effectively married ‘the instability of archival technologies’ with ‘an extensive palette of pastoral timbres,’ and ‘quietly set a particular tenor of work for a new generation of Mid-Eastern European ambienteers.’ Blurb man might be onto something there (that or on something), but anyway after this Bednarczyk’s energies were diverted, split between various techno-oriented outings till he found a way back with his recent New Rome project, via which we find him now exploring a new approach to more atmospheric works; with a radically reductive set-up, we’re told, ‘he took single sources and exploded their potentials so that he was able to create minimal, yet dense sound textures through a process of layering and synthesis.’ This approach is evident on Illustrations For Those Who on Room40, each piece singular in terms of its source, the results forming a cohesive whole, with each maintaining a detailed and rich sensibility built around complex cycling of sonic materials.KrysaliSound is aimed, as well as promoting owner Francis M. Gri‘s projects under a single brand, at being open to all audio-visual forms, for artists with philosophies outside musical convention. Two releases are covered here, the first from Kobe-based Hirotaka Shirotsubaki, who ‘uses sampled guitars to create dreamy landscapes and emotional textures moving the listener in a quiet and safe inner dwelling,’ we’re told. Faint nausea at that ‘dreamy’ notwithstanding, we know we’re safe having encountered his Wet Petals (Naviar, 2017)—equipoise over noise, yet free from twee—in ER #4. His Last Goodbye comes with an affecting byline: ‘My life was with this “Heisei” era. In order to live a new era with one break at the end of this era while I am alive, I have decided the title of this album to be “last goodbye” with a determination of parting. The 6 tracks that make up this album have my memory fragments scattered around.’ Bless. Next, a Dane proving great in terms of the swell of his øjeRum catalog, Paw Grabowski affirms his status as an artist of refinement with The Forest Is Sleeping Within The Trees, originally released by Scissor Tail, remastered and reissued by KS; piano and pump organ collude in a sort of spiritual research in ‘a deep combination of human desolation, devotion and fragility’—ideal for Basinski buffs seeking more ready-made Melancholia and all that pian-tastic disintegrating loop jazz.Lest you missed The Green Kingdom‘s Expanses five years ago, Dronarivm has provided a re-issue, expanded with ten rethinks, Expanses Remixes. According to Michael Cottone, his homage to classic ambient and ambient techno (albeit passed through the filter of dusty samples from old vinyl and classical records, the odd guitar melody, electronics and some soft rhythmic pulses) had taken taken on a life of its own, reaching a larger than expected audience through particularly fortuitous circumstances; a slightly otherworldly, mysterious, album within TGK’s oeuvre, back in print with a bonus album of diverse creative mixes from artists such as Tobias Hellkvist, Hotel Neon, Warmth, Auburn Lull, Segue, and Halftribe.Forest Management‘s Passageways, ode to his childhood home, a secluded apartment complex managed by his parents whose various eponymous connections ‘seemed to be endless corridors into discovery and imagination as much as to how time’s passage overtakes our perception of spaces,’ is his most personal work yet. Full of submerged melodies, gentle pulls of surging tonal shifts that arc, shimmer and fade into a dark purple hue of shifting overtones, it evokes how John Daniel ‘as a young kid […] would adventure around the apartment building and its surrounding property.’ A place to which the artist attributes much of his early imagination and creativity, he observes ‘…the idea of your home no longer being there is strange, but change is necessary. This home was simply a “passageway” into the life that I live now. … A sense of sentimentality about home, about a place and time.’ Cincinnati’s Whited Sepulchre provides.ASC is back (in fact he’s back so often you’d never know he’d been away) with one of his beatless outings, offering evocative and engulfing compositions that navigate the dark v. light binary beloved of ambient scribes deficient in descriptors, rendering these tired tags otiose. With the The Waves James Clements sparsely populates a pelagic setting with harmonised drone limned with aqua-static soft noise, staying shy of sometime frequented grey areas, favoring an “Endless Blue” mood. Silent Season curates.Scott Campbell may be known to producers and sound design gearheads for his DIY tape manipulation devices (viz. Onde Magnétique) and possibly for timbral creations as half of Bell Mountain. His recent Photos From The Flood was inspired by the remains of a family photo collection transformed by a parental house flood in Louisiana in summer 2016. Awash with muffled cameos, decaying melodies weave in and out of each soaked and sunken song, mirroring the warped state of the photo albums which left artist and family struggling to see beauty through destruction in the floods’ aftermath. Though many of the pictures were ruined, their colors had run into beautiful abstractions. Like a glimpse of a half-life, with the subtle suggestivity of song and lost rehearsal tapes of gauzy folk tunes, PFTF conveys a warmth, melancholy, and associated sense of loss. ‘An excellent representation of the nostalgia which ephemera often contain. Manages to blur the lines of joy and loss in a gentle manner.’ (W A R E N S I A N S, bc) Specialists in soundtracking physical manifestations of personal nostalgia, 79Ancestors, present.New project, Iluiteq, from Italian experimental vets Sergio Calzoni and Andrea Bellucci, known for projects such as Orghanon, Colloquio, Red Sector A, and Subterranean Source, release debut album, Soundtracks For Winter Departures. First listen reveals classic ambient drone, distinguished by meticulous sound design, smooth harmonic arrangements and a palette deploying a wide range of sampling and synthesis techniques, enhanced by guitar, piano and field recordings. ‘Instilled by the colours of winter, the music evokes the act of leaving for uncertain destinations, a collection of soundtracks for winter departures.’ …TXT Recordings delivers.After a hyper-productive 2018, with a slew of full-lengths and a brew of mixes and features for online radio station NTS, Mancy mood-swinger Sangam sees in 2019 with more ‘ambient portraits of social dysfunction, depression and heartbreak’ (The Wire). You Make Me, a third full length for Kudatah (and 35th overall!) showcases his ‘deep hazy and soft sonic melancholia,’ enhanced by a guest-collab from Tokyo bo-homie, Yoshimi, on finale “Anon Solitude,” driving the album’s ‘holistic concept of isolation’ even further. His extensive use of foley, ASMR and familiar public environments blended with rich layers of lush otherworldly atmospheres make for a familiar yet futuristic sound world that pulls you in. And from late last year there’s Vitality on Pure Life: tender melodies circle in the air and evaporate like smoke with signature style overlapping synth loops that grow, entangle and fade over the cityscape. ‘These tracks suggest a survivor’s mindset: acceptance, clarity, new perspectives and moving forward. But the memories remain…,’ prompts the blurb. Can’t vouch for that; mastering by CMD094 is safe, though. Latest, Aspect, via Aurawire, alas, has the dubious honor of most banal blurb of the month award: ‘Sangam continues his beautiful ambient drones with subtle, dreamlike moments scattered about. Aspect tells a story of a relationship gone wrong with heartfelt meanings buried deep into each song, making listeners feel like they’re going on a journey deep through their deepest feelings and emotions.’ Blah. Vaporware ≠ vapid text?Xièxie (Chinese: 谢谢 – English = thank you) appears to be a kind of impressionistic audio travelogue of Will Long’s sojourn in China, setting out ‘A week before leaving, I bought a dictionary and phrasebook. Covered in rain, during the days and even the nights, Shanghai was lit in a glow, a mist turning to a constant grey fog. Buildings lined with neon and lcd screens flashed, and from around corners and behind buildings, the night was illuminated much the same as the day. Cars separated the classes, their horns voices punctuating the streets, as pedestrians in groups loosely scattered the streets, talking and walking on speakerphone.’ Further reflections in dream-reality lost-in-translation mode follow, mirrored in its long-form neo-isolationist drift by Celer’s music, then pay-off: ‘I bought a dictionary and phrasebook, but “xièxie” was the only word I ever got to use.’ Physical release (2LP, 2CD or 2CS) on the artist’s own Two Acorns.Following his Serenity Channel on Strange Rules and Patterns of Lust for Holy Geometry, ‘a dreamy, melodic package of four beautifully-written and caring impressions,’ and selected ambient works, Cordial alongside Angelo Harmsworth and Opening night with Forest Management, Dominic Coppola brings To Have Done Nothing courtesy of Austin TX’s Plush Organics, which trails it thus: ‘Immense warmth and low end coat these incredibly melodic recordings while the textural pops and clicks from tape hide underneath them. Emotional music that tends to slow down everything around you as it continuously washes and swells.’ Literally and metaphorically, a well-sustained body of work.Mercy Within is billed by the artist known as Hilyard as ‘another chapter in my ongoing musical journey to find some peace of mind in this world’, and it succeeds in spadeszzz. Created in a solar-powered forest cabin in desolate winter months, it provides not only comfort for dark nights, cold isolation and fuel for pensive fire-gazing, but, bold claim from the man with the healing plan, ‘layers of my own grief and regret slowly peel away with this music to reveal the mercy and self forgiveness that lies within.’ All this and Angela Klimek aka Poemme too, who adds vox to “From Omens.” Stereoscenic, of Ambient Sleeping Pill fame, hosts. Szzzorted, then.Jonas Munk (Manual) and Jason Kolb (Auburn Lull) like to dwell on their Billow Observatory albums, and their third, III: Chroma/Contour, with its ‘effervescent soundscapes, delay-laden instrumentation, shape-shifting aural textures and gently unfurling compositions,’ <snooze> is no different. Blurb blather is larded blowsy epithets—all ‘luxurious’ ambient music, ‘glistening guitar,’ ‘fluid chord progressions,’ ’emotion-rich movements’ and ‘synthesizer-fired 1980s’ new age. If that sets your pulse racing, you can calm down, as they ‘eschew the pulse and rhythm that defined the duo’s previous effort (II: Plains/Patterns) in favor of sparse melodic possibilities and a more abstract palette of sounds,’ though it’s teasingly proposed: ‘Chroma/Contour suggests looking both 20 years forward and twenty years back, while forgetting the present altogether.’ Sustaining the hype, suggestion is ‘there’s a conceptual dimension to several tracks on the album, with guitars, analog synths and voices mangled by samplers, computer software and a broken dictaphone into pure abstraction.’ The nature of the concept remains unclear, however, and, sleep-written promo text aside, though decent, it’s a somewhat safe, sometimes anodyne, affair.Last chance saloon: For Tokyo world-builder, H. Takahashi, ‘the dissatisfaction with reality that I feel on a daily basis’ fuels his last set of serene micro-miniatures for Not Not Fun, Escapism, which does what it says on the tin with percolating synth patterns and minimal melodic fluorescence crafted into refractive audio-sculptures. Of H.T.’s touch NNF call it ‘hushed, precise, and prismatic, coaxing spectrums of illusion and bliss in its tinted glass spirals,’ mixing up a maxim: ‘Extreme tension produces extreme relaxation.’ Yeah, baby. || Positive Centre‘s The Leaf Switch sees his less techno-inclined voice channeled by the febrile Opal Tapes, which also has DIY cassette star, Angelo Harmsworth, bring a set of ‘seethingly bittersweet electronic stress tests’ (soundcloud) on Kompressor. || On their second album, Esam, French duo Ligovskoï pursue in-depth innerzone exploration with what Dutch imprint Field Records describes as ‘a painterly and romantic form of music,’ recalling ‘vast landscapes, abstract patterns and poetic movement.’Last Orders: Purveyor of ‘broken music for happy people,’ autumna explores venues and avenues, gets us ‘lost in worlds filled with melancholia and memories of summer sunbeams,’ on the untranslatable hiraeth, and gives us an ‘often dark but always with a soft shimmer or hint of diamond dust’ sleep treatise, via his own September Harvest. || Bird flew (pun presumably intended) from Sean Curtis Patrick (split with Trevor Edmonds) is in here for a winsome vignette, “Marsh Wren Overhead,” (plus we like his visuals as well as his music, last sighted/cited in ER #3 and ER #1 || Ruben Void‘s snappy byline goes: ‘I find my inspiration mainly by making myself empty’ pausing only to qualify his ‘musical cartography of my psychological developments and conflicts’ with ‘I feel myself vibrating constantly between emptiness as a downward dragging melancholy and the ascension towards a cosmic vacuum full of infinite potential.’ If that fails to engage, the vibrant Belgian’s ‘field recordings, cosmic noise, lysergic guitar improvisations and lo-fi warped piano melting into dreamlike sonic landscapes’ may draw you into The Infinite Approximation‘s psychoactive collage-kid drone-ambient on Unfinished Monkey.",articles20,"['Dmitry Gelfand', 'Basinski', 'Selva Oscura', 'Bill', 'Midway', 'Basinski’s', '’ Luna Monk', 'Kenichi Oka', 'Plancha', 'Embrace', 'Tokyo Joe', 'Black Swan', 'Ss', 'Beacon Sound', 'Tomasz Bednarczyk', 'Faint', 'Warmth', 'Auburn Lull', 'Segue', 'Halftribe', '…', 'Specialists', 'Yoshimi', 'Pure Life', 'Latest', 'Aspect', 'Aspect', 'Will Long’s', 'Covered', 'Angelo Harmsworth', 'Emotional', 'Jonas Munk', 'Patterns', 'Extreme', 'Angelo Harmsworth', '’Last Orders', 'Trevor Edmonds', 'Belgian’s']"
"Ever one to look out for the out-there outsiders of outer-rim electronics, Marmo Music has plumbed the inter-depths to unearth a Berlin trio. Keller Crackers, Konstantinos Tassopoulos, Anna Vila and Sylvana Wickman, are a crack team of experimenters, utilizing a bank of modular machines, distant voices and a self-made steel cello in their compositions. The group’s first release, KC, comes in the wake of a number of inspirational live shows in the German capital and captures the energy of these one of a kind performances.Ambient tones are tethered by pulsing pads in the strangely alluring “Specialised.” Spoken word coldly recounts services, “pest control, breast reduction, clothing”, that echo and fade next a towering wall of trembling sound. “Cow Tongue” follows, a fifty second lament to this “disappearing delicacy.” Nothing is quite stable on the record with sands and sounds constantly shifting and re-adjusting. “Αιθουσες Αναμονης”, meaning “Waiting Rooms”, is emblematic of the unsettling nature of Keller Crackers. Vocals stalk a stark beat, lost in a forest of circuit bent melodies and resonance. The flip sees Antinote’s Tolouse Low Trax turn his able hand to “Specialised.” The German artist steadies the floating introspection of the original with a rudder of percussion, a slow steam engine chug, steering complementary hues and shades into his interpretation while maintaining the uncertain course. “Colours” closes. A dreamy poetic fairytale of whimsical synthlines, shimmering chords and arcing flute notes care of Robert Würz, this final curtain is arguably the most playful of the quintet on offer.The musicians associated with Marmo are not exactly known for coloring inside the lines. Keller Crackers are no exception. Through abstract medley, reimagined ballads, analogue noodling and cello string, the triumvirate of Tassopoulos, Vila and Wickman challenge preconceptions and boldly present their audio art. A group daring to be different, and undoubtedly succeeding in their endeavor.The release party for KC will take place at ACUD macht neu in Berlin on April 12th with live performances from Keller Crackers and Tolouse Low Trax.KC is available as on Marmo Music March 29, 2019.

"[Press-Release] Day Before Us is back with a new physical album titled Ode à la nuit d’ombre whose music navigates through dusky ambient and mysteriously rumbling textures with a delicate post-romantic touch enhanced by a deep sense of melancholia. The two musical personalities (Philippe Blache and Natalya Romashina) offer an adventurous exploration on reflective soundscapes and inner personal journeys. The result is lyrical, epic, moving, engaging and emotionally absorbing. This album might appeal to fans of micro-genres such as dark ambient, modern classical and electronic post-minimalism but more generally to anyone in touch with colorfully dreamy melodic music with elegiac qualities.Conceptually this album develops a strong interest for the blackened and ecstatic beauty of French’s “poésie maudite,” for nostalgic meditation in front of metaphysical issues, for aesthetic and religious components of self-reliance as well as for the magical idealism (as stated by the enigmatic and symbolical nature of the cover artwork).The edition is delivered in a beautiful digipack package and will be available in March for a few hundred of copies.Ode à la nuit d’ombre is available on OPN. ~PBOde à la nuit d’ombre by Day Before Us",articles20,"['Day Before Us', 'Natalya Romashina', 'Day Before Us']"
