"Mike Lisanti, long time manager of bass artists such as Kompany and Tynan, has recently left his partnership with Warpath Group and moved to Prodigy Artists. He is bringing Kompany with him, as well as signing Moody Good and Crankdat with co-owners, Will Runzel and Steven Haddad. Lisanti, whether you know it or not, has been in the scene making moves happen for a long time. I had the pleasure of meeting him while he was on tour with Borgeous at Sunset Music Festival 2015. His dedication shows with each move he makes and this move to Prodigy is a long time coming. You can hear from him directly below, “This has been a full circle transition for me as I have known Will and Steven for almost 7 years. The other manager in the camp, Andrew Mckeough (who does Whipped Cream, Habstrakt, and OMNOM) was my agent back when I was an artist in 2012-2013. It’s a rewarding feeling to be able to partner with people that I have looked up to in the industry for such a long time.”
                                                                                 -Mike LisantiWe can expect to see some quick and powerful moves for Crankdat, Moody Good, and Kompany with Slander, NGHTMRE, and Joyryde already crushing it at Prodigy. Keep an eye on these three artists, as they’re going to be hitting new heights with this dominant team now in place. “I’ve been friends with Mike for over 6 years now and he completely fits our ethos of working with kind, honest and talented individuals. Crankdat, Kompany, and Moody Good have the same qualities and all of the above are exciting additions to the family environment we’re building at Prodigy Artists”                                                       -Will Runzel (co-founder and manager of Prodigy Artists)I have had the pleasure of working with both Will and Mike over several years. These are stand up guys. Not only do they work hard, they are supportive and caring. You can see this with the attention to detail with the projects they have on their resume. This collaboration will create a big shift in the industry and a large move upwards for Prodigy Artists. I am beyond stoked to see where they take things in the next year. Keep eyes on these artists as music starts rolling off the shelf.  comments",articles10,"['Prodigy', 'OMNOM']"

"The Chainsmokers continue the rollout of their third album  today with the release of their newest single, “Call You Mine,” featuring Bebe Rexha.For the first time in the album so far, Drew takes a step back from vocals and lets Bebe take the reigns completely. Honestly, it’s a smart move seeing as her vocals are so dominant, and her talent absolutely shows on this new track, even in spite of some possibly overused effects. A lot of the effects are reminiscent of my least favorite parts of , but “Call You Mine” also shows how Drew and Alex have leveled up their songwriting and pop production.Much of what turns me off of this track is the pitched vocal chops in the chorus; apart from that, Bebe’s vocals on top of everything else sit like a queen upon a throne. While it sounds like a compliment, the fact that her voice is so far detached from everything else makes it seem like TCS came in after rather than produced the song with her.All in all, I’m still going to hold off on final judgment until I hear the song in the context of the album, but I’m already waiting for the next track from  to keep my attention.Meanwhile, the music video for “Call You Mine” depicts the aftermath of The Chainsmokers’ grizzly murder at the hand of Bebe.

"30-Hour Rave Coming To Star Wars Film Site This YearWith electronic music taking over the world and traveling to more and more exotic locations than ever before (Mt Everest, the pyramids of Giza, Great Wall Of China, etc.), there are fewer and fewer exciting places to host events.

It’s special for its location of Ong Jmel in Tunisia’s southern desert, which is best known for being the filming location for Luke Skywalker’s fictional hometown Mos Espa in .Unlike traditional festivals, Dunes Electroniques more closely resembles a classic rave, in that it will go for 30 continuous hours.

"It’s inconceivable to think that a song as universally memed as “Baby Shark” has received an official remix from an artist like Jauz, but it’s 2019, and here we are. The remix was first debuted during his set at Coachella this year, and beyond the obvious kitsch of it all, the beat is actually solid.Still, this is going to the remix you hate to love. Not only are the original lyrics still completely intact, untouched, but now they’re accompanied by an electronic produced beat that will actually guarantee the lyrics never leave your mind. I honestly can’t tell whether to hate this or love this. In all likelihood, it’s a fair bit of both.“I was definitely more than shocked at the response I got, the tweet I posted asked for what I thought was a really lofty goal of 20,000 likes on the tweet, and within a few hours, I think it had surpassed 22,000 without breaking a sweat,” Jauz explains.“After that, I knew I had signed an unwritten contract between myself and my fans to make it happen. To take a song like ‘Baby Shark’, something that is so universally known by infants all the way to grandparents all over the planet and turn it into something of my own was a huge task.”Now, here it is in all its glory.

"The Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner wedding / Diplo live stream saga continues…As we previously reported, the superstar couple got married in a Las Vegas ceremony earlier this month. A small, star-studded guest list was there to witness it all happen. But, the world was able to watch as well, all thanks to Diplo.The producer left his tact at the door, live streaming the entire thing and causing the newlyweds a bit of a headache. They clearly weren’t expecting all the added attention — and Joe’s mom ended up finding out through the live stream, before he had a chance to call home.In a recent interview with Capital FM, Joe joked about the whole ordeal:“Yeah, [Diplo] did ruin it,” he said. “I love Diplo, but he loves his ‘gram more than a 13-year-old. He, like, posts every five seconds. He literally live streamed with dog face filters.”Diplo just clapped back via the post below, “the only thing that ‘ruined’ your wedding was your fit.”Sounds a little savage if taken out of context, but the playful nature of all this leads us to believe they’re simply close friends taking this situation as an opportunity to roast each other. the only thing that ‘ruined’ the wedding was your fitA post shared by  diplo (@diplo) on  W Magazine diploJoe Jonaslive streamroastruinedSophie TurnerweddingWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Today is my first time hearing of metsä, but I’m already craving more. Born with the name Maxwell Prendergast, a bit much for the music world, he chose to go with His love of nature is reflected in his productions, which conjure up images of windchimes on a porch and a soft breeze blowing through the tall grass. Serenity and peace are the goals, and he certainly achieves them with these two new singles, “All Night” and Like To Know.”The first, “All Night,” was written with Lolaby back in 2017; the two held off on releasing it as they “knew we had created something worth holding onto after finalizing it.”The second track, “Like To Know,” plays a bit more fast and loose with melody. At points, the whimsical song is perfectly in tune and at others begins to detune and go off the beaten path, as if affected by some external force. It’s hard to say what the inspiration for this song was, but it seems like a lesson in growth.Both singles are available below and precede a forthcoming EP from metsä.  all nightgoldroomlike to knowLolabymetsäminervaracreleasesinglesLover of all bass music.

"It’s been an exciting time these past years seeing more and more states legalize recreational and medical cannabis, and others move to decriminalize on their way to full legalization. For a majority of those who listen to music, the herbaceous plant often enhances the experience and make festival food more palatable. Now, Illinois is poised to become the 11th state to legalize recreational cannabis.The Illinois house approved a bill today with a vote of 66-47 already approved by the Senate yesterday, and now only needs a signature from Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker. Pritzker, who campaigned for office on a promise to legalize weed, quickly issued a statement in which he promised to sign a bill that he said offers “the most equity-centric approach in the nation.”“This will have a transformational impact on our state, creating opportunity in the communities that need it most and giving so many a second chance,” Pritzker said in his statement.There is one major difference between Illinois and other states, however. Whereas other states have approved legal weed via voter initiatives, Illinois will become the first to do so via legislature.The bill takes effect Jan. 1 and would allow residents age 21 and older to legally possess 30 grams of cannabis, 5 grams of cannabis concentrate or 500 milligrams of THC contained in a cannabis-infused product. Nonresidents could possess 15 grams of cannabis. Chicago Tribune cannabishouseillinoislegalizationlegislationMarijuanavoteweedWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"After a long wait, SLANDER and Said The Sky’s collaboration “Potions” is now officially out.The song dropped today with an official music video via Proximity, which told the story of a young man thinking back on the love he shared. Throughout the course of the video, it becomes clear that something happened for him to lose the relationship, and he uses his “potions” to escape the pain… or maybe to help him remember.Constant arguments and underlying unhappiness end up being the cause for the split, and he takes his potion again and again and again. Eventually, we learn that the potion lets him share a space with his love, whom he’d given a vial to. He keeps taking it wanting to see her again, and finally, well… we won’t ruin it for you.“Potions” featuring JT Roach has been long-awaited by fans for months.

"Get ready for a blast from the past! Diplo just spiced up our lives with a totally amazing and unexpected cover of the Spice Girls‘ smash hit “Wannabe.”Charli XCX provides the vocals for this 90s music revival, as Herve Pagez and Diplo breathe new, rhythmic life into the timeless guilty pleasure track. We’re instantly obsessed — because this isn’t one of those remixes just for the sake of a remix. Instead, this is a complete makeover and an outstanding performance on all three artists’ accounts.Properly titled “Spicy,” Charli XCX gives a nod to the Spice Girls’ original delivery, whilst including just enough of her own personal flair. Along with Diplo, Pagez sets a new pace in motion, adding unique flavor to the cover and an incredibly catchy groove to to.The iconic “Yo!” sample gives the song some much needed familiarity, as these artists serve up their own version of the iconic girl power track. Sprinkle in some sugary vocal chops and spicy percussion on top — and there it is.We can always expect the unexpected from Diplo, but this one takes the cake!Watch the music video for “Spicy” below.For an added bonus, we also know now that Diplo has been working in the studio with Camila Cabello — whether that’s for his Silk City project, solo, or Major Lazer should be revealed soon enough..@diplo’s Instagram Story pic.twitter.com/ApwKxDM1ff— Camila Cabello News (@CCabelloNews) May 29, 2019 Charli XCXdiploHerve Pagezspice girlsspicyWannabe",articles6,"['Spice Girls', 'Properly', 'Camila Cabello', 'Major Lazer']"
"To everyone wondering why and how there was an actual goat in the crowd at Movement Detroit this year, there’s a somewhat reasonable explanation for all of this…The goat, which made his rounds at the music festival and caught GRiZ’s epic closing set at the main stage on Monday, is owned by Detroit’s Erick Brown. The man is a local celebrity, as is the goat.Many in the crowd who witnessed Brown carrying his pet goat through the crowd were left in shock. Some took photos and videos, or turned to their friends like, “WTF?!” Others, mainly Detroit locals, know the owner’s backstory and realize this goat is much more than a goat — it’s his BFF.It’s easy to shake your head at this and say, “Who brings a goat to a festival?!” But, there’s more to the story…Prior to the spotting at this year’s Movement, Brown’s life journey made local papers, including the . this viral article explains the hardships that Brown and his previous goat, Deer, faced together in their newfound home. This includes a brutal beating Brown suffered, which nearly took his life.“I grew up as a person with disabilities,” he previously opened up in the editorial. “I’ve always been picked on my whole life because I’ve always been different.”Word on the street is that despite Brown’s local fame, he was recently jumped and beaten again. We’re unable to find any evidence of this recent incident or if Deer suffered because of it, but amidst the whispers in the crowd I heard firsthand — “My friend watched him get jumped last month” and “I think his old goat died,” etc.To better understand the story of Erick Brown and his goat, we urge you to read this.Still, that doesn’t begin to explain why security would allow the goat inside festival grounds. Surely, Movement isn’t the place for a goat — even though the animal was welcomed with open arms and there’s no doubt his owner loves him dearly.I’ve personally pet this man’s goat once or twice outside the festival gates, as they were roaming around last year. However, I can’t recall if it was Deer or this new goat he had by his side. Perhaps outside the festival, where it’s not as loud and hectic, is a better place for Brown to experience the festival with his bestie next year.See some of the footage and comments below.Hes a famous, homeless, Detroit local, he was attacked a few months ago and his other goat was killed in the attack i believe and this is his new goat.

At this time, the fate of Defqon.1 down under remains unknown.The statement below brings the past 10 years to an end in one sweep. Unfortunately, Defqon.1 has been unable to lock down a replacement venue that adheres to the quality standards they live by.There’s another side to the story, however. Last year at the event in Sydney, two attendees died and over 700 others sought medical assistance over the course of the festival. The NSW Government and Premier Gladys Berejiklian began implementing ideas to shut the festival down (which they appear to have done successfully), though the festival was offered a new home in Canberra, approximately 275 km southwest of Sydney.Organizers promise music fans they will continue to explore options for hosting events in other countries, as well as its home in the Netherlands, where it began in 2003. If/when Defqon.1 does return to Australia, Q-dance will be sure to update.In the post below, the company elaborates on their tough decision to cancel the festival after a decade of music and memories…Sydney International Regatta Centre

"EDM is still dusting the glitter off from Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas, which was held a couple weekends back — and Alison Wonderland just shared one of her favorite behind-the-scenes moments from the festival.EDC is the perfect playground for testing out IDs and Alison knows this firsthand. The producer showed up early, the night before, for a soundcheck. That’s when she tested out her “I Remember” remix for the first time ever on festival speakers — and the footage will straight up give you chills.She shares in the post below:AW went on to play an insane set at EDC Las Vegas’ iconic kineticFIELD, during which she debuted her version of the deadmau5 and Kaskade classic for the crowd. Then she hit up the Parliament art car for another house-only set.The music world is full of unforgettable moments — and this is just one of them. Enjoy. I made this version of I remember w my laptop & headphones. Here is me testing it on festival speakers for the first time the night before EDC when no one was there. Super surreal moment.

"A lot has changed in the past five years for Deadmau5: he’s gotten married, debuted a new cube, and now he’s bros with Martin Garrix. But way back when, he had an amazing concept called Coffee Run which saw him driving around with his DJ friends and just talking to them.Five years ago, the most legendary episode of the series aired, when Deadmau5 drove the streets of Toronto with not only Dillon Francis, but also Skrillex. The 90-minute long video tackles everything from Motörhead to Godzilla to cars, production, touring, and, of course, coffee.Each of these artists’ lives has drastically changed in the past five years.

"Some acid trips sound so unbelievable, they come across more like myths or urban legends, rather than reality. However, sound engineer Eliot Curtis recently experienced the trip of a lifetime — and he’s here to tell you his truth.The broadcast operations manager was working on a piece of music history, a design by music pioneer Don Buchla, when he found himself at the center of a surreal experience literally years in the making. It was a Buchla Model 100 modular synthesizer to be exact, straight out of the ’60s — the same era that brought about stories of LSD-laced music equipment.Curtis got to work, disassembling a newer module when he noticed a crystal-like substance stuck under one of the knobs. He attempted to clean it the equipment and rubbed off the rest of the residue with his finger. After about 45 minutes, he felt the sensations of an acid come up.He ended up going on a 9-hour trip before continuing with his repair. Sure enough, when the testing came back, the crystalized substance was identified as LSD.It’s unknown whether the synthesizer, owned by Cal State University, was intentionally laced with LSD in the past, or if a spill happened at any point over the years. Either way, this legend has proven to be at least partly true. GizmodoKPIX acidDon BuchlEliot CurtisLSD trip",articles6,"['Sure', 'Either']"

"Skrillex and Boys Noize headed to Tampa, Florida this past Sunday for a performance as Dog Blood at Sunset Music Festival. By all standards, the set was everything it should have been and both Skrill and Boys Noize kept the energy up for the entire set.Unfortunately, not everyone can handle their substances and it seems one attendee jumped the barricade at the front of the stage at the end of their set to try and do… something. The video recording below begins too late to see the onset of the commotion; it begins as security is already detaining the attendee, who is clearly inebriated.“Just be calm down there, security, I know you’re just doing your job,” he says on the mic. As the attendee starts to struggle, security gets rougher. “No no no no no, guys guys, please, please, just chill. Just calm a little bit. I think everyone’s cool. He’s a kid, just move him out calmly.”As security begins to move the attendee out, he stands up and slurs, “It’s not over, it’s not over.”It’s at this point that Skrillex seems to be losing his patience a bit. “What are you trying to do man? The show is over, just go home bro. Alright now you’re resisting these guys, I’m not gonna stick up for you anymore.“You’ve got 10 security guards on you, man, just go home.”Good on Skrillex for both sticking up for the kid and also knowing how to recognize a lost cause and bring the attention back to their own show. Dog Blood’s new EP  comes out this Friday. Listen to a new mini mix from the duo here. Skrillex being the good person he is!!

"Madeon yesterday teased fans with the announcement of a new song and the beginning of his . In his announcement, he stated, “Tomorrow morning I’ll put out a song in the real world.” This sentence in particular seemed to have been glossed over or otherwise misinterpreted, because Madeon has done literally that.Rather than release a song for streaming, he has released two vinyls each in four cities across the world (so, eight total): Los Angeles, New York City, Alesund, and Nantes. Specific addresses for record stores in each city (almost) were made available on his website goodfaith.world.At time of writing, vinyl in Nantes are sold out. A specific address for Alesund has yet to be revealed. The New York store has opened and more than likely been claimed. And the Los Angeles store opens at 1pm PST.However, it appears that Rough Trade NYC in Brooklyn was already playing the record in the store when it opened, and a considerable amount of the recording has made its way onto Twitter.Madeon’s new song is called “All My Friends.” It will be available on streaming services worldwide on Friday, May 31.That new @madeon 🔥 pic.twitter.com/t2AAqcipIZ— Kenny (@Kennmau5) May 29, 2019 Rukes.com alesundall my friendsGood Faith Eralos angelesmadeonnantesnew yorkrecord storesvinyl exclusiveLover of all bass music.

"Jauz Announces Official Release Of “Baby Shark” Remix This FridayWhen Jauz finally debuted his anticipated — and we say that with a straight face — “Baby Shark” remix at Coachella last month, we never dreamed it would actually get an official release. And yet, here we are, 46 days later, and that’s exactly what’s happening.This afternoon, Jauz announced that his “Baby Shark” remix is “finally coming out” this Friday, May 31. The original song from Pinkfong, an education brand within South Korean media startup SmartStudy, was released on November 25, 2015 and as of May 2019 this version has garnered over 2.8 billion views on YouTube.Fans wanted Jauz to remix the song since his own brand is shark-related, and… “Baby Shark” is a meme. That’s pretty much the extent of the justification.Regardless, it happened, and here we are, and I’m actually excited to hear it in high quality this Friday. You can hear a clip of the remix from Jauz below.A remix by the people, for the people 👶 🦈 the Baby Shark remix YOU all made happen is finally coming out THIS FRIDAY!

"DanceSafe continuously strives to make the EDM community a safer place and the organization’s latest effort is a big win for everyone. Under Colorado state law, testing kits used to identify controlled substances are no longer considered drug paraphernalia, partly thanks fo DanceSafe and other campaigners.A package of bills were signed off by Colorado Governor Jared Polis on Thursday, May 23rd in attempt to help curb the opioid epidemic. Senate Bill 19-227 was part of the cluster that takes effect. The new law focused on harm reduction will likely save lives.DanceSafe has been working since the late ’90s to help cultivate an educated and safe rave culture. The organization’s latest accomplishment immediately affects those in Colorado, but they’re shooting to overturn any law against test kits across the US by 2021.DanceSafe Executive Director Mitchell Gomez elaborated via EDM.com:DanceSafe has been known to pass out testing kits at music events and festivals.

"UPDATE 5/29 | Our original suspicions were correct that this was not an official account. It was a “social experiment” created by a group of individuals who aim to intentionally deceive the public through the use of false advertising. While this is a somewhat admirable goal in teaching a lesson, doing so with an artist whose use of cryptic messaging and hidden clues is already well established doesn’t do anyone any good.To reiterate, unfortunately, there is no confirmed news of any Porter Robinson, Lady Gaga, or Lemaitre collaborations on Madeon’s new album. Any actual collaborations with these artists is purely coincidental.Madeon’s new single is called “All My Friends” and is being released exclusively on vinyl today ahead of its streaming release on Friday. You can find out how to listen here.Madeon is about to bless us with a new era’s worth of music, as we reported earlier today. It all starts with a single coming out tomorrow.With the news of the Good Faith has come the launch of a cryptic website and this mysterious social media account on Instagram, also with the same name, @goodfaith.world. It seems to reveal tracks off an entire album, as the tags reveal apparent track titles and features.“Echoes” featuring longtime collaborator Porter Robinson is one of them. “Ethereal” featuring pop sensation Lady Gaga is another, but her tags have been removed since the screenshot was taken below. One more collab is revealed as “Wild” featuring Norwegian indie electronic duo Lemaitre.Whether this is an official account is yet to be revealed, but we can’t help but speculate what we’re seeing here. Either this is Madeon’s own side account, or a superfan who knows details about the project.Stay tuned — Madeon is due to drop a new song in just hours.  ECHOESetherealgood faithlady gagaLemaitremadeonporter robinsonwildWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Dallas Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott has come under some serious heat for using force against an Electric Daisy Carnival security guard at the Las Vegas music festival earlier this month. While initial reports stated the football player wouldn’t face legal punishment, the victim is requesting a sincere apology or he may do so himself.Kyle Johnson was the 19-year-old security guard who was pushed into a rail and knocked over by the 23-year-old athlete on festival grounds. Johnson divulged that he wasn’t injured during the incident. He did get an apology from Ezekiel Elliott, but wasn’t totally satisfied with it.Johnson explains:Zeke’s attorney, Frank Salzano downplayed the incident in another statement to TMZ SportsAccording to newly surfaced reports, Johnson is now considering pressing charges… unless he receives a proper apology, that is.See video footage from the incident here. H/T: Hot New Hip Hop | Source: TMZ | Photo via Marc Van Der Aa for Insomniac Events ApologyDallas Cowboysedc las vegasEzekiel ElliottfootballKyle Johnson",articles6,"['Ezekiel Elliott', '…']"
"Zeds Dead Drop All-Throwback Set For 100th Episode Of Deadbeats RadioHundreds of artists played at EDC Las Vegas this year. But even with so many artists on the official lineup, there were still more secret and surprise sets on art cars and stages across the weekend. On Sunday night at 2:37am at the bassPOD, Zeds Dead were scheduled to play a throwback set as a surprise for the crowd. Unfortunately, due to the high winds on Saturday that caused RL Grime to forfeit his set time, the Canadian duo relinquished their slot to the trap god.Fast forward to today, and Deadbeats is dropping their 100th episodes of Deadbeats Radio with the set that ZD had prepared for EDC at the bassPOD two weeks ago.This is an hour of high octane throwbacks and classics, though don’t go comparing it to Skream & Rusko’s set. While both are throwbacks, each has their own flavor and style. With Zeds Dead, you’re getting a lot of 2011-2013 brostep and dubstep, rather than the 2008-2010 deeper material that Skream and Rusko were laying down.Tracks like Stinkahbell’s “Something In Your Eyes (VIP)” or Friction vs. Camo & Krooked’s remix of “Sweet Shop” by Doctor P definitely still keep the old school sound alive, though.Check out the full mix below, and congrats to Deadbeats and Zeds Dead on making it to 100 episodes!Zeds Dead – In The Beginning

"Earlier this month, Diplo sort of shocked fans by suddenly and unexpectedly live streaming the entirety of Joe Jonas and Sohpie Turner’s Las Vegas wedding. By all accounts, no one in the wedding party was expecting that to happen, and it all sort of became a media circus by the end of it.In a new interview with Capital FM, Joe talks about the strangeness of it all.“Yeah, [Diplo] did ruin it,” he told host Roman Kemp. “I love Diplo, but he loves his ‘gram more than a 13-year-old.“He, like, posts every five seconds. He literally live streamed with dog face filters,” Jonas continued, laughing it off.As Your EDM reported earlier this month, “The couple had been engaged since October 2017, but apparently this all happened pretty quickly. Following the Jonas Brothers‘  performance, Sophie and Joe decided to elope, inviting a star-studded guest list and booking Diplo as their DJ.“Khalid was also in attendance and country duo Dan + Shay performed their hit song ‘Speechless,’ as the couple’s wedding song.”Watch the video of the Jonas brothers’ interview below. capital fmdiplofunnyinterviewJoe Jonaslive streamSophie TurnerweddingLover of all bass music.

The track seems to be a sort of successor to the two’s first collab, “Life & Death,” considering the similarity in titling.The drop is some pretty hard midtempo, and clearly, from the video, the crowd is ready to go wild for it.

"Madeon Changes His Profile Pictures, Signals Something Is ComingIt’s something simple, but so important: a public figure changing their profile picture on social media. It’s unclear who really started the trend, but the fact of the matter is when an artist, especially in music, changes their picture on social media, something is coming. When each social post is valuable currency, taking up a slot with a new profile picture has to mean something.Today, Madeon has changed all his photos online — but it’s not  new, and that makes it even more cryptic. His new photos are a color-inverted copy of his Facebook profile picture he’s had since November 2017. At a glance, it’s not a stretch to assume the photo symbolizes transition or mutation into something new.Fans have been hoping for new Madeon material (apart from “Shelter”) since his debut album was released in 2015. In a social post on January 30, 2018, Madeon wrote he was finishing his album that year. Also possibly related, Madeon’s birthday is in 3 days. All of this leads to the inevitable conclusion that  is happening… we just don’t know what.Keep an eye out. Rukes.com BirthdaymadeonNew Albumprofile picturesocial mediateasertransformationupdateLover of all bass music.

"Tiësto has been hammering out tracks in 2019, releasing nearly a dozen new originals and remixes this year so far. This Friday, he’s dropping what should be one of his biggest pop tracks of the year, teaming up with Jonas Blue and Rita Ora for “Ritual.”A cursory search online doesn’t yield any results for the song, suggesting it’s never even been played out live before. In this day and age of teasers and such, it’s rare to say that. But it also provides a bit of mystique for the track and we’re definitely open to that.“Ritual” by Tiësto, Jonas Blue, and Rita Ora is out this Friday.

"ATTEMPTED MURDER EDCRelationships can be tricky, but most of the time it boils down to trust. And when two partners don’t trust each other, terrible things can happen. 20-year-old Ryan Mansour, who is jailed on an attempted murder charge, allegedly ran over his estranged girlfriend for apparently attending EDC Las Vegas “against his wishes.”Reports , Mansour saw posts from his girlfriend at the festival last Tuesday, and left his work to go “get back all the things he ever gave her,” because she “did not deserve the cards or bears he gave her in the past.”During the course of the argument, his girlfriend, whose name was redacted in the official police report, got into Mansour’s car and later got out. Mansour said he backed up, put the car in drive, without seeing her, and “almost immediately heard (the victim) say ‘stop, stop.’”Mansour’s attorney asserts that he was quick to recognize the gravity of the situation and leapt out to “jack the car up” to get her out from under it. “Ryan stated he did not run her over on purpose but admitted he was full of rage and made a dumb mistake due to his state of mind,” his arrest report states.Las Vegas Justice of the Peace Ann Zimmerman ordered Mansour held on $25,000 bail. “I can’t ignore how serious this case is,” the judge said, “and how serious her injuries are.”The victim suffered a broken leg, broken arm, broken pelvis, lacerated liver and collapsed lung, along with burns to her face and body, wrote .  attempted murderedc las vegasfestivalrelationshiptrustWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"With the expansion of internal and external storage within cell phones in recent years, standalone MP3 players like the iPod or Zune have become more of a novelty than the necessary accessory they were in the early ’00s. That being said, fashion is cyclical, and there’s always opportunity for the retro to come back in style.Apple today introduced the new iPod touch. That’s right, the last great MP3 player is getting an update for 2019 with all new bells and whistles, and a sleek look. The internal processor is now an A10 Fusion chip (the same one found in the iPhone 7) along with a new 256GB storage option. And better yet, it’s still relatively affordable.“We’re making the most affordable iOS device even better with performance that is twice as fast as before, Group FaceTime and augmented reality starting at just $199 [for the 32GB model],” said Greg Joswiak, Apple’s vice president of Product Marketing. The new iPod Touch will run you $299 for the 128GB model and $399 for the 256GB model. “The ultra-thin and lightweight design of iPod touch has always made it ideal for enjoying games, music and so much more wherever you go.”Though an expanded internal storage will allow users to store more music for offline listening, the device still supports music streaming with Apple Music, a catalog of over 50 million songs, thousands of playlists, Beats 1 Radio, and more.The A10 Fusion chip also supports smoother graphics in games on the devices, and the new Apple Arcade service. “This fall gamers can look forward to Apple Arcade, a game subscription service with over 100 new and exclusive games with no ads or additional purchases, and the ability to download games for offline play. Apple Arcade is the perfect complement to the already enormously popular catalog of free games on the App Store.”The new iPod touch models are available to order starting today from apple.com and in the Apple Store app. Appleapple musicgaminginternal storageiPod Touchoffline musicStreamingLover of all bass music.

"Long Lines & Intense Heat Lead To Stampede At We Are FSTVL In EnglandWe Are FSTVL went down this past weekend, May 24-26, at Damyns Hall Aerodrome Ltd in Upminster in the UK. With headliners including Chase & Status, The Black Madonna and Jamie Jones, fans were understandably excited to get into the festival grounds on Saturday and get the party started. However, due to an alleged lack of wristbands at the gate, festival goers were forced to queue for over 3 hours in blistering sun. Eventually, they had enough.Videos below show hundreds, possibly thousands, of attendees rushing the metal gates in a stampede at We Are FSTVL on Saturday as security does their best to maintain order, ultimately failing.“They’d run out of wristbands at the door so they didn’t have drink token wristbands when they were letting people through,” one 20-year-old female, who didn’t want to be named, told Radio 1 Newsbeat.“They weren’t handing out water so everyone in the queue for three hours didn’t have a drink.”Eventually, the heat and stress got to people and they rushed the gates, creating a stampede and terribly unsafe conditions for anyone who happened to be caught in their path.“A barrier got thrown into the crowds, the woman next to me got hit by it and it sliced a massive chunk out of her leg,” the woman continued.“She’s passed out on the floor, security ran over to her and people were just charging through. They took out the barriers, pushed through security, punching security, just taking everyone out in their way.”Take a look at some videos from the stampede below.THIS IS NOT SAFE @wearefstvl #Shambles pic.twitter.com/CL4Xur1HrS— Rave Footage 🎥 (@RaveFootage) May 25, 2019#WeAreFestival @wearefstvl my friend filmed this, i was trapped inside the tent while all this was going on clinging to a pole so I didn’t get trampled on, after three hours of queuing and the blaring sun it wasn’t ideal…. pic.twitter.com/yoYZyTgJUN— alexi hickin (@alexi_hickin) May 26, 2019We Are FSTVL, issued a brief statement on Saturday night apologizing.

"Martin Garrix was performing at Omnia Las Vegas during his residency when he suffered an injury last night. The superstar DJ/producer tried to push through his set before the pain set in and he realized how serious the injury actually was.He apparently hurt his ankle jumping off stage and resorted to hopping on one foot for the rest of the show to keep the energy up. In the end, Garrix cut his performance short and was taken to the hospital. We can’t help but point out what a trooper he was during this unfortunate incident. Leave it to Garrix to keep a positive attitude.In the photo/video footage below, you can see Garrix’s badly swollen foot after the accident. He also took a short clip of the ambulance ride, so despite the serious nature of his injury, it’s obvious he remained in good spirits the entire time.Get well soon!Sorry Martijn to hear that your ankle is broken.Hope you are feeling good and please rest.Remember that we love you xx @MartinGarrix pic.twitter.com/jeRZ9ab5Nl— praise the lord (@allsmilesasap) May 26, 2019this is what i was talking about, take care @MartinGarrix !! 🥺❤️ pic.twitter.com/Cn34Ij8SVr— Martin Garrix Pics (@MGarrixpics) May 26, 2019That man @MartinGarrix keeping the show going after breaking his ankle at @omniaLasVegas! pic.twitter.com/xO1gZhXrb7— Mo Miniato (@MoBuckeye) May 26, 2019 Rukes.com ankleInjurylas vegasMartin GarrixOmniaWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

Yeah, never mind, that’s probably a bad analogy.As The Chainsmokers reveal in the new doc, fame was never their goal. Instead, it was to make the best music they possibly could. And that music just so happened to blow up in ways they never could have imagined.Years of hard work paid off with an entire world tour, as they hit up stadiums in major cities across the globe. The pressure was real, the tour prep was insane, and now The Chainsmokers finally get to share their swift rise to superstardom from their perspective.We don’t want to give too much away, because The Chainsmokers’  documentary is well worth the watch.

"Local police department wants people to stop bringing their horse down Old Town RoadThe popularity of Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” has propagated throughout every age bracket, socioeconomic level, race and more. It’s a verified hit and there’s no way you could escape it. Now, the song is having real life consequences for residents new Manchester, New Hampshire, where the real Old Town Rd. is causing trouble.Apparently, aspiring rappers were heading to the road and filming amateur rap videos or covers to the song, and disturbing local residents. It got so bad that the New Hampshire police department posted a notice on its Facebook:The department ended the post with a joke, posting a photo of Dean from “Supernatural” as a cowboy with the caption: “You’ve yee’d your last haw.”Clearly there is some humor in the situation, and it’s hard not to get a chuckle or two out of it.

"Alesso To Star In New Netflix Black Mirror Mini-SeriesFans of Black Mirror, the popular Netflix series that explores stories of alternate realities, were a bit disappointed when they learned that the new season releasing this year would only be three episodes. (Find out why here.) Then again, quality over quantity, right?Still, fans wanted more — so they’re getting more. In partnership with Netflix, a mini-series called Little Black Mirror will debut exclusively via YouTube. The trio of mini-episodes are set to release May 26, June 2, and June 6. The series is directed by musician/actor Rudy Mancuso and includes social media star Lele Pons, Maia Mitchell, and Mancuso.Also included in the series will be producer/DJ Alesso. Though we only see him briefly in two clips, it seems his DJing skills will be used for his role, along with his impressively convincing thousand yard stare.Check out the trailer for the mini-series below.

"Here Are The Most-Played Tracks From EDC Las Vegas 2019This year was the biggest ever at EDC Las Vegas, with bigger artists, bigger stages, more people, and more space than ever before. Including art cars and Corona Electric Beach, this year’s EDC had a staggering 15 stages with over 300 artists between them — that’s a lot of tracks being played out.But, thanks to tracklist aggregator 1001tracklists, we know what the top 10 tracks played at EDC Las Vegas this year were. Compared to last year, only one track remained in the top 10, Gammer’s “The Drop,” which dropped from #1 to #2. The rest were new to the top 10 list, but not necessarily all tracks were new.Fisher’s “Losing It” making the list is no surprise, but to see RL Grime’s “Core” make a comeback at #10 is a bit surprising; same with “Prison Riot” from Flosstradamus and GTA. What’s also surprising is the actual absence of “Old Town Road,” either the original or the remix with Billy Ray.See below for the full top 10 list from this year!  dj snakeedc las vegasEliminateepticFishergammerTop 10 trackstracklistLover of all bass music.

"At the beginning of the month, it was announced that father of Avicii, Klas Bergling, would speak at IMS Ibiza 2019 on the topic of mental health and shining a light on the vital work of the Tim Berling Foundation. This past Thursday, Klas spoke, sharing the ethics and philosophy of the newly created foundation, once again drawing attention to the importance of recognizing and treating the early signs of deteriorating mental health, anxiety and depression for performing artists and those working in the music industry.The interview at IMS was conducted by well known producer/DJ/radio host Pete Tong. In the interview, Klas paid tribute to his son and outlined some of the areas that may have contributed to a deterioration of his state of mind, pointing at a punishing schedule, lack of sleep, pressure to perform and alcohol abuse all contributing to depression and anxiety.To celebrate Tim’s life and to continue his legacy, the Tim Bergling Foundation was created on March 26, 2019, funded solely from the estate left by Avicii. Working internationally but starting initially in Sweden, the foundation aims to educate people and businesses on the issues surrounding suicide and mental health, also focusing on climate change and endangered species, causes that were very close to Tim’s heart.Read more about the Tim Bergling Foundation and submit your own memories of Avicii here. aviciiibizaims 2019International Music SummitinterviewkeynoteKlas Berglingmental healthpete tongtim bergling foundationLover of all bass music.

"Last week, actress Natalie Portman pointed out some flaws with Moby‘s most recent memoir, For starters, she was 18 not 20 when they began hanging out. And her side of the story is quite different.She referenced an excerpt from the book that described them as “dating,” which was really more like, “a much older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school,” from her perspective. Natalie said she wished Moby or his publisher would have reached out ahead of time to fact check the story.After getting a reaction out of his former crush, Moby’s initial response didn’t allow room for error. He explained they did, in fact, date and didn’t understand why that was up for interpretation. Now, he’s opening up much more and offering a genuine apology to Natalie.He says her concerns are “very valid” and calls himself “inconsiderate” for not contacting her ahead of time. In another post, Moby addresses some underlying issues with external validation, which may played as a factor.Read below.




 As some time has passed I've realized that many of the criticisms leveled at me regarding my inclusion of Natalie in Then It Fell Apart are very valid. I also fully recognize that it was truly inconsiderate of me to not let her know about her inclusion in the book beforehand, and equally inconsiderate for me to not fully respect her reaction. I have a lot of admiration for Natalie, for her intelligence, creativity, and animal rights activism, and I hate that I might have caused her and her family distress. I tried to treat everyone I included in Then It Fell Apart with dignity and respect, but nonetheless it was truly inconsiderate for me to not let them know before the book was released. So for that I apologize, to Natalie, as well as the other people I wrote about in Then It Fell Apart without telling them beforehand. Also I accept that given the dynamic of our almost 14 year age difference I absolutely should've acted more responsibly and respectfully when Natalie and I first met almost 20 years ago.

The lawsuit seeks €2.4 million for breach of contract.Carola recently took his Music On residency to Pacha, which just so happens to be a rival club on the island. When Amnesia caught wind, the promoter ordered a fine in the amount of €2.4 million, pending court review.Soon after, Carola’s opening gig at Pacha came up. He played anyway.The DJ appeared in Ibiza court yesterday for a separate complaint filed by event promoter It’s All About The Music SL, asking the DJ for €4.48 million. They say every show played outside of Carola’s contract could result in further consequences. Writes , “Carola’s lawyer rejected all the accusations, stating that none of the legal requirements had been met in order to proceed with the seizure of his client’s property and earnings.”continues, “It’s All About The Music SL is continuing to pursue the seizure of Carola’s assets as a precautionary measure, so as to ensure he has enough funds to pay the damages sought.”So far, no public word from Marco Carola.

"This past weekend at EDC Las Vegas, 23-year-old Dallas Cowboys RB Ezekiel Elliott was filmed accosting a security personnel and being summarily handcuffed — detained, but not arrested. Elliott was suspended in 2017 over a domestic violence accusation and therefore is under league scrutiny for any and all incidents. However, allegedly, he will receive no punishment from the league for this latest incident.At least according to Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, no league punishment is expected to come down on this latest Ezekiel Elliott incident. Said Jones at OTAs, per ESPN:“I think that the main thing is that I don’t see anything that needs supporting . . . In terms of [Elliott’s] status with us, [it] has not been impacted in any way. And frankly, I know how conscientious he has been in the offseason, and that’s good enough. No, I don’t see that having any consequences for us.”“Security misconstrued and overreacted to the situation,” Elliot’s attorney, Frank Salzano said in a statement to TMZ Sports “He was cuffed as a precautionary measure. He was released with no charges and left Vegas that night and went to his [youth football camp in Dallas] on Sunday.”Jerry Jones said there's ""been some talk"" between the Cowboys and Ezekiel Elliott's representatives about a contract extension. Jones added: ""We talk contracts around here 100 percent of the time. We're talking somebody's contract all the time. … He would fall into that group.""— Jon Machota (@jonmachota) May 24, 2019Of course, only time will tell what comes of Elliott. Watch the full incident below if you’re not up to speed. detainededcedc las vegasezekiel elliothandcuffedNFLLover of all bass music.

"Kelsey Lu dropped the Skrillex-produced “Due West” last November, and now the OWSLA don is back with his own remix of the track.When “Due West” dropped last year, it was a soft and slow tune that didn’t scream influence from Skrillex. And perhaps that was part of its beauty; Lu’s voice was absolutely the star of the track, as it should have been. But now, Skrillex has come out of his shell to put his own clear spin on the tune.What we get is closer to Skrillex’s new style than his old. It’s still a pretty slow and sensual tune, but he adds a good amount of funk and bounce to the production. Ultimately, it’s still not the Skrillex that a lot of people are craving, but there’s no denying this is a stellar track and awesome to listen to.Check out Skrillex’s remix of “Due West” from Kelsey Lu below! Rukes.com downtempoDue Westkelsey luNew MusicremixskrillexLover of all bass music.

"Kaskade Speaks Out About Cancelled EDC SetEDC Las Vegas this year was just about perfect. Zero deaths and a tight ship kept the festival running smoothly; unfortunately, when the wind kicks up, there’s really nothing you can do to fight against mother nature. With gusts approaching 35-40 mph, the festival was forced to shut down the main stage, kineticFIELD, for the remainder of the night for attendees’ safety (controversy aside).After Tiësto finished his set, moments before Kaskade took to the stage, the announcement that the venue had to be evacuated due to wind went up. While fans were of course disheartened by the news, he was probably just as gutted.On Tuesday, he posted a message to fans: “This is me moments before I was supposed to take the stage at Electric Daisy Carnival (EDC). Sadly it was not meant to be. Weeks of preparation in finalizing new music….
That rush of adrenaline right before I go on…
The anticipation…”Some were fortunate enough to see Kaskade still throw down at Camp EDC that morning — for the rest, however, they either had to see him on the strip during his residency at KAOS or wait until next time.

A new video today from his YouTube has uncovered a bit of the mystery.The exact location of the cubes is still unknown. Also unknown are the logistics behind the cubes… Will only a select number of people be able to enter the cubes? Will it be open to the public or is there an RSVP link to come? Will people stay in the cube for the duration of the album?

"In what was expected to be a mostly YES vote, the Miami Beach commissions just voted 3-4 NO on bringing Ultra Music Festival to the city in 2020. For those not familiar with the area, Miami Beach is a separate city in Miami off the coast, much like Virginia Key.Right now, publicly, at least, Ultra has only been courted by Homestead-Miami Speedway, approximately 30 miles southwest of Miami. The city of Homestead last night approved later hours until 2am and a 10 year possible contract to the Speedway in order to court the festival. Miami Beach would have been a great opportunity to keep the festival closer to the clubs and hotels that sustained it for so many years when it was at Bayfront Park.The Miami Beach Commission did not offer up any alternatives for what it called a horrible spring break season.The Miami City Commission (different than Miami Beach Commission) sought to make Ultra a discussion item during the meeting dated June 27th.  commissionersMiami Beachno approvalultra music festivalvote noLover of all bass music.

"EDC Reports Zero Deaths For Second Year In A RowThe main stream media likes to make electronic dance music festivals out to be awful events rife with drug overdoses, illicit sex, and death. Coverage of this kind has certainly decreased in recent years as major music festivals have grown in size and harm reduction efforts have become more popular; but, nonetheless, unfortunate deaths still occur. That being said, for the second year in a row, EDC Las Vegas reported zero deaths at its annual festival.When EDC moved to Las Vegas in 2011, it experienced a period of transition that involved having to deal with the intense heat of the Vegas desert. Deaths in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017 certainly marred the festival, but it always bounced back.Then, in 2018, EDC moved the festival up a month to May in an attempt to combat the heat — and it worked. The festival reported zero deaths in 2018. This year, once again, EDC reported zero deaths for the second year in a row.While this could be contributed a lot to the cooler weather, EDC’s own staff onsite providing medical care is some of the best of any festival in the world. Medical personnel roam the festival from dusk to dawn, and a fully stocked medical facility is also found on the festival grounds, with emergency room doctors, nurses, EMTs and paramedics.History unfortunately dictates that zero deaths is something to be celebrated, rather than the norm. However, perhaps it’s beginning to shift more in that direction.Congratulations to EDC on another successful year, and we look forward to returning under the electric sky in 2020! annualedc deathsedc las vegasfestivalHarm Reductionlas vegasmedicalsafetysecond year in a rowzero deathsLover of all bass music.

The shipments were expected to arrive on May 1 and May 4.An undisclosed Vaucluse resident, age 31, was arrested in connection with the illegal activity.

"Could Illenium & Kayzo be collaborating?So much of the interaction between EDM artists happens on Twitter, if SMS and iMessage stopped working tomorrow, most DJs would be totally fine. Whether it’s trading stems back and forth or sending each other WIPs, it’s undeniable that magic happens on Twitter.Both Kayzo and Illenium played circuitGROUNDS this past weekend at EDC Las Vegas, and maybe that stage gave them a little magic to take home, because we might be getting a collab from the two of them soon. In fact, the Twitter exchange below seems just a  too rehearsed to be pure coincidence, but that’s just conjecture on my part.What is objectively true is that Kayzo is probably sending Illenium a track to check out and maybe work on. What is objectively true is that both Kayzo and Illenium have albums coming out this year. Does this collaboration already exist? Maybe. Could it come out after either of their albums? Possibly.No matter what, you know I’m excited about it.i have this one song thats up his alley no doubt— kayzo (@KayzoMusic) May 22, 2019Got u— kayzo (@KayzoMusic) May 22, 2019 Rukes.com collaborationILLENIUMkayzosongstemsteasingtwitterLover of all bass music.

"The Bonnaroo arch has become the festival’s most iconic imagery — having never attended Bonnaroo myself, the arch still represents the festival and conjures up thoughts of the event. However, moving forward, whatever arch or structure adorns the entry will not be the same arch that we’ve known.@TheFestiveOwl was the first to share an image of something burning at the Bonnaroo farm. Even at such a distance, the shape of it made it pretty clear it was the arch.Something (the arch?) is on fire on the @Bonnaroo Farm.

"Movement weekend is almost upon us and while the flagship event in Techno City aka Detroit is the highlight of the weekend, the afterparty culture is a close second. Just as the music festival strives to bring attendees the best and most diverse lineup possible, venues and promoters across the city accent Movement with their own carefully curated lineups.Techno takes up a great percentage of sound waves over the weekend, but year after year, Movement consistently draws up a lineup that manages to please music lovers of all kinds. Hip hop, house and funk are strongly represented this year, but there are no boundaries and nothing is off limits.Bass music, however, is a bit out of the ordinary for Movement weekend, which is what makes the MASSIVE warehouse lineup stick out amidst the swarm of house and techno-driven afterparties. Snails, Space Laces, Buku and Stuca lead the pack, with local support from Attak and Flats Stanlie. Plus, Nightenjin takes over a secondary stage on site, setting an alternate mood in the massive warehouse space that is The Russell.Chad Smith, aka Attak, is the mastermind behind the operation headed by his Ignyte Events team in collaboration with MeanRed. Not only does this event, as well as countless others, hope to bring something different to the table — their focus is set on keeping the warehouse experience alive.So, is bass music during Movement as taboo as it sounds? With the event just days away, we picked Chad’s brain about the MASSIVE concept. Here’s what he had to say…What does it mean to you, to be bringing a show of MASSIVE proportions to Movement weekend?With primarily techno and house-driven afterparties, do you feel there’s a void to fill with this bass-centric lineup?What’s your biggest goal with the MASSIVE vision?What’s the best part about the Detroit dance music scene?Learn more about MASSIVE here and explore our entire pre/afterparty guide here.  bass musicdetroitMassiveMovementThe RussellWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"If you’re looking for a lesson in longevity in electronic music, one of the models to follow would have to be Firebeatz. Tim Smulders and Jurre van Doeselaar met at music school in the Netherlands more than 10 years ago. Since then they’ve formed a lasting friendship and musical legacy. The boys have stayed relevant through almost a decade’s worth of changes in electronic music. Together they have an unassailable legacy of working with the biggest names in the industry from Calvin Harris, Tiësto and Martin Garrix, and an impressive set of stamps on their passports as well, having played all over the world and at the biggest festivals including EDC, Ultra, and Tomorrowland.Tim and Jurre have almost wrapped up their North American tour, which had stops in Philadelphia, Miami, and Los Angeles and Chicago. We got the chance to catch up with the guys and hear from them about a number of topics. Tim and Jurre talked about evolving their sound over the years, their record label, Ignite Recordings, how they stay close to the fans and the tour.IgniteRecordingsIf you missed the tour check out this video of their upcoming collaboration with Oliver Heldens at their performance at Academy in Los Angeles.There’s still one more date left, a special boat party at Pier 15 in New York City on June 28.

"The annual International Music Summit (IMS) Business Report for 2019 is now available following this year’s conference in Ibiza. While there are many signs of positive growth in dance music, there are also plenty of potentially worrisome issues plaguing some of dance music’s biggest markets.Like any industry, one market can affect many others. When dance music’s biggest market, Las Vegas, does poorly, other areas can suffer. According to this year’s report, fewer people are going to nightclubs and pool parties in Vegas. In 2016, 15% of visitors to the city said they had been to a nightclub during their stay, which fell to just 7% in 2018. On a similar note, the amount of people going to pool parties during the same period fell from 11% to 4%.This has had further reaching effects. The world’s highest paid DJs are now earning the lowest amount since 2013. While this doesn’t seem like a huge deal when they’re still making tens of millions per year, it would likely affect the fees of DJs being paid less than them, as well. The top 3 earners currently are Calvin Harris, The Chainsmokers, and Tiësto.Still, some sectors of the industry are experiencing growth. An IFPI survey ranked dance as the world’s 3rd most popular genre, with an estimated 1.5 billion people typically listening to it. Markets in Germany and Canada also experienced growth over last year, which is good for internationally traveling artists (even though the dance share of recorded music fell in the US and UK).Speaking of traveling artists, underground artists are beginning to get more recognition and tour dates. Nina Kraviz played 35 festivals last year and Amelie Lens (who only played 4 festivals in 2017) ranked second with 27 shows, both ranked ahead of Armin van Buuren with 26. Charlotte de Witte and Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike also made the top five.The intersection of dance music with video games is also a rapidly growing opportunity for DJs and dance music producers. The video games industry is worth 7x more than music, and artists like deadmau5, Marshmello, and more are reaping the benefits of getting in while the coals are hot.The full report is available now, seen below. Rukes.com 2019dance musicearningsgrowthibizaIMSims 2019International Music Summitmarket shareReportLover of all bass music.

"Mysterious Avicii Cube Coming To Six Cities This JuneSince the death of Avicii last year, it’s been interesting to see how his team has continued to push content out in his name.

This will all happen over the course of two days, June 1 & 2, days before is released on June 6.Apart from the video and the information within, nothing else is known about what the cube is, how it relates to Avicii or his music, or how fans can sign up.

"Bitch, I feel awesome — and Colin Thomas has everything to do with it. The producer recently hit us with three explosive new tracks, packaged together as his Bossin EP.One must learn the rules in order to break them and that’s exactly what Thomas does here. His technical skill set allows for a playful approach to g house. Thus, this flavorful and versatile EP adapts to any music setting, showcasing the producer’s craft and providing three different moods that play nice together.“Bossin” is bad to its core, rocking them laser beams and giving a nod to the current tech house craze. “One Hundred” builds on the theme with a more forceful approach, perfectly described as a “quirky, bassy late night roller.” Finally, “With Me” finishes strong with a tasteful mix emphasized by the low-end.If you don’t know, now you know.

"Is Ultra Music Festival staying in Miami?A meeting today between the members of the Miami City Council has renewed hope that the city of Miami might still play host to Ultra Music Festival next year, despite the festival itself voluntarily pulling its contract earlier this month. In a special “Sunshine Meeting,” Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez, commissioners Ken Russell, Keon Hardemon, Manolo Reyes, and Joe Carollo, and Manager Andrea Agha and Council Member Luis Lauredo from Virginia Key discussed the possibility.Ultra Music Festival headed to Virginia Key in 2019 where it experienced a litany of issues, exacerbated by the short preparation time organizers were given by Miami City Council. A return to Bayfront Park or any other familiar Miami venue would streamline the 2020 event, though, of course, the earlier a decision is made the better. As far as Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez is concerned, Virginia Key is off the table.See the discussion live tweeted from @KBKeyNews below.6/ Now on to Ultra. Hardemon is asking colleagues if there is an appetite to re-engage Ultra.— KeyNews (@KBKeyNews) May 21, 20197/ Commissioner Carollo responds: ”I do know that Virginia Key was a complete mess…. It bothered more people than ever before.”#Ultra— KeyNews (@KBKeyNews) May 21, 20198/ Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez said that Ultra only told him they had made a decision to move on, and that he was expecting the concert to be at Virginia Key again in 2020, until he got the termination letter.— KeyNews (@KBKeyNews) May 21, 20199/ As to luring them back to Miami, City Manager Gonzalez says, “It is a loss for our city. That kind of economic impact for the residents of our city, I think it’s a huge loss. It’s unfortunate. If there is anything I can do to get them to reconsider, I would be happy to do it.“— KeyNews (@KBKeyNews) <a13/ Afterwards, Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez said he would re-engage with Ultra.

"Las Vegas is a city where anything can happen — especially when Kaskade & Deadmau5 are involved. With so many DJs in one place all together, whether for usual residencies, special EDC week shows, or EDC itself, all bets are off and you never know who will show up where or what might happen.This past weekend, during Kaskade’s normal residency at new club KAOS, Joel Zimmerman aka deadmau5 was also in attendance (he also has a residency at KAOS); but, he wasn’t particularly there for the music. Kaskade shared with the crowd, “While I’m up here playing, deadmau5 just texted me, ‘Dude turn it down, I’m sleeping up here. Message me when you’re done.'”“Hey Joel! Wake up, pussy!” he continued, playfully. “Come on down here and play some records with me!”Calling out Joel lolPosted by Olivia Terrazas on Sunday, May 19, 2019As it turns out, Joel did wake up and he did come down to play a record with Kaskade, namely the two’s 2008 collaboration “Move For Me,” which predated their more widely known “I Remember,” released later that same year.While there were probably loads of people in the typical Las Vegas crowd who didn’t know what kind of legendary moment they were witnessing, there were still loads more who recognized history when they were seeing it. That being said, deadmau5 didn’t stay for long. “Deadmau5, everybody!” Kaskade proclaimed before heading into the rest of his set.Watch the moment below.Joel's reaction was just how I expected it.Posted by Olivia Terrazas on Sunday, May 19, 2019 collaborationdeadmau5jokingkaoskaskadelas vegasmove for meresidencySleepLover of all bass music.

"Minutes after the Miami City Council motioned to put Ultra Miami back on the next city commission meeting agenda, as well as directing city manager Emilio Gonzalez to renew talks with Ultra, Homestead-Miami Speedway called a special call meeting to authorize longer hours.The venue called the meeting in Homestead in an attempt to petition for longer operating hours, extending its current 11pm curfew to 2am.Within the petition, Al Garcia of HMS lays out prospective dates for Ultra 2020: Friday, March 6 through Sunday, March 8 from 2PM to 2AM each day.

"Over a month ago, Getter cancelled the remaining dates on his Visceral tour and took a personal hiatus from social media. Hate from so-called fans and retaliation against his much chiller tour gave Getter a tough time, and he needed to “unplug” and find a more healthy headspace.In an update to fans just now, it seems he’s found one.“With [social media] cut out, shit instantly got better,” Getter wrote. “[…] Everyone always says ‘don’t listen to em’ but that’s easier said than done. Call me what you wanna call me but at least I’m being honest with myself for once.”For right now, it doesn’t seem like Getter is in a hurry to get back on the road. That being said, he’s still making music and it’s going to be just for him. If his fans like it, that seems to be a cherry.“I’m gonna keep putting out music for me, and that’s it. I’m gonna have my management run socials for me so I can keep this mindset going. Every thing else in my life has been going so well. I feel like I have some fuckin breathing room for once.”Amen, Getter. Let’s keep those good vibes going.

"Two major events happened this past weekend: first, obviously, EDC Las Vegas; and second, the series finale to Game Of Thrones. Having attended the festival myself this past weekend, it’s hard to really say with any confidence which event people were more excited about.Heading to the festival on the shuttle, no one was talking about the sets they were going to see or where they’d be headed. For the most part, people were sharing tips on which terms to mute on Twitter so they wouldn’t see any spoilers. However, for those who ponied out the extra cash for VIP, it didn’t matter.Over by main stage, and at least one other location at the festival, the series finale of Game Of Thrones was being streamed in the VIP area. Walking through the VIP entrance with food, activities, and drinks was interrupted by the sound of Winterfell — with captions, of course.For those who could spare an hour during their night, they were met with the ending to one of the greatest media series of our generation.

"Did Moby really date Natalie Portman?Moby’s second memoir, , came out earlier this month, on May 7. Within the book, described as “a classic about the banality of fame, […] shocking, riotously entertaining, extreme, and unforgiving,” Moby recounts various encounters and experiences in his life as a touring artist and romantic.Apart from stories of a tryst with Lana Del Rey, back then still going by her given name Lizzy Grant, Moby also tells of a brief time dating Natalie Portman while she was attending Harvard. At least, Moby would like to believe they were dating…According to Portman, who spoke with  about the passage, it was closer to “an older man who was interested in me in a way that felt inappropriate.”She continues, “I was a fan and went to one of his shows when I had just graduated. When we met after the show, he said, ‘let’s be friends’. He was on tour and I was working, shooting a film, so we only hung out a handful of times before I realized that this was an older man who was interested in me in a way that felt inappropriate.”Moby’s telling of the story is… different. According to him, the two began dating soon after they met backstage at a concert in Austin in 1999. That would make Portman 18 years old, confirming her story, rather than 20 years old, which is what Moby recalls. They attended the MTV VMAs together, and he visited her occasionally at Harvard. “At midnight she brought me to her dorm room and we lay down next to each other on her small bed,” he wrote of one such encounter. “After she fell asleep I carefully extracted myself from her arms and took a taxi back to my hotel.”Moby has since responded to Portman’s interview. In an Instagram post, he wrote:

"Last week, things seemed incredibly bleak for Woodstock 50. Despite a decision in New York Supreme Court that investor Dentsu Aegis Network did not have the capacity to completely cancel the festival on its own, a dark cloud still hung over the event and faith in its ability to still throw a complete event by August was waning.However, somehow, miraculously, Michael Lang, co-founder and co-producer of the 1969 Woodstock festival and this year’s 50th anniversary, found a new investor. According to a press release issued by Woodstock 50, the Oppenheimer & Co. brokerage and investment bank will provide financing for the event.“Oppenheimer & Co. has signed on as a financial adviser to complete the financing for the festival…,” read the release. “Event preparations will continue as planned as Oppenheimer joins the list of strong institutions producing the festival.”While an investor is all well and good, it doesn’t solve all of Woodstock 50’s problems. It still requires a mass gathering permit from the city, which is required before tickets can go on sale. And then there’s the equally massive problem of consumer faith in the event, which has been effectively neutered by the media’s reporting that it has already been cancelled. Yet, Lang’s positivity knows no bounds.In an interview with Sirius XM Volume last Thursday, Lang said an on-sale date could be announced in the next 10 days and tickets could go on sale in two weeks. Tickets would cost less than $400, and “a limited number of one-day tickets will be sold, which is contrary to a previous comment in which he said no one-day passes would be available,” writes .“We believe in Woodstock as an important American cultural icon and look forward to its regeneration in the green fields of Watkins Glen this August with all of the artists on the remarkable lineup,” said John Tonelli, head of Debt Capital Markets & Syndication at Oppenheimer.Time will tell if the festival ends up a bust or a success. Woodstock 50 is scheduled for Aug. 16-18. Jay-Z, the Lumineers, Miley Cyrus, Carlos Santana and more than 80 acts are scheduled to perform at Watkins Glen International raceway in Schuyler County. continue as plannedfestivalfinancinginvestorMoneyon sale dateWoodstock 50Lover of all bass music.

"Virgil Abloh is never one to do things by the status quo. The founder of Off-White™ and newly appointed Men’s Artistic Director of Louis Vuitton is also a DJ, and so frequently uses the Pioneer CDJ-2000NXS2 and DJM-900NXS2 combination. It seems as if the standard design of the hardware wasn’t quite enough for Abloh as he took it into his own hands for a new museum exhibit debuting soon.From June 10 to September 22, 2019, Abloh will exhibit the NXS2 “skeleton” models at his first museum exhibition entitled “FIGURES OF SPEECH.” The “TRANSPARENT” CDJ-2000NXS2 and “TRANSPARENT” DJM-900NXS2 will be on show at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Abloh’s hometown of Chicago.“As a means to give a new look and feel to the industry standard of the CDJ and DJM I aimed to design a see-thru and non-labeled rendition of the classic models to inspire a different sound while DJing,” Abloh stated. “And perhaps a new way for music technology and human interaction to equal a different result.”The exhibit opens to the public June 10. General admission is $15; teachers, students, and those over 65 will pay $8.

"Whether you enjoy popular music or not, you have to admit — it’s popular for a reason. Millions of people listen to hits on the radio and stream them over and over again. That’s simply what makes them hits.Zedd couldn’t help but snap back at a fan who dubbed his song “Stay” with Alessia Cara as “the would’s worst and most annoying song ever.” He could have easily read the comment and scrolled by, but there was a point to be made here.“Somewhere between working our asses off day & night and trying to create something we love we must have accidentally created the world’s worst song.”The song did hit number one on the  Mainstream Top 40, by the way.Well played, Zedd.We’re sorry, Emma.

"The Glitch Mob threw down an epic performance at EDC Las Vegas this weekend — and the bassPOD stage was absolutely destroyed in the process. Not only did they deliver much of their fan favorite music, the group came prepared with some unreleased secret weapons.1788-L joined the legends on stage to play out their forthcoming collab together. As bass heavy as you can imagine, the new track is a hybrid between The Glitch Mob’s signature style, with the force of 1788-L behind it. The result sounds like a natural progression with the group’s sound that’s truly meant to be.The Glitch Mob also brought out LICK to play yet another unreleased track. LICK’s bold, melodic energy meshed with The Glitch Mob’s more nostalgic sound made for yet another standout banger in the set.Everyone loves a good surprise (or two) — especially at EDC.

"If there’s one thing I’ve learned in five years of working in media in dance music, it’s that this industry really sucks at keeping secrets. Earlier this weekend, Insomniac founder Pasquale Rotella tweeted about a special guest performing day 2 at circuitGROUNDS, and it wasn’t long before everyone zeroed in on Skrillex.The OWSLA head and legendary producer/DJ took to the stage at 10:30pm last night and threw down an eclectic set that sat somewhere in between complete improvisation and a typical Skrillex set — whatever that means.Unfortunately, the live stream didn’t show the set and so everyone at home was left wondering what the 45,000 people at circuitGROUNDS were witnessing. Thankfully, cameras like GoPros now have good enough audio and video quality that capturing a full set isn’t difficult.Watch the first 25 minutes of the hour-long set below, and join the discussion here. Rukes.com circuitgroundsedcinsomniaclas vegasliverecordingskrillexSurprise SetLover of all bass music.

"Dallas Cowboys superstar running back Ezekiel Elliott was put in handcuffs at EDC Las Vegas over the weekend. The NFL player pushed a security guard into a metal gate and to the ground — and the entire ordeal is captured on camera.The incident apparently started when Elliott was spotted in the parking lot at the music festival arguing with his girlfriend. He didn’t become violent, but at times was using his body to block her from walking away.In the video below, Zeke addresses one of the event staff (who appears to be minding his own business) — “You got something to say!?” He again, used his body to push over the security guard.“Security misconstrued and overreacted to the situation,” Zeke’s attorney, Frank Salzano said in a statement to TMZ Sports “He was cuffed as a precautionary measure. He was released with no charges and left Vegas that night and went to his [youth football camp in Dallas] on Sunday.”The football star was not arrested, only detained by metro police on site and later released. TMZ Sports Dallas Cowboysedc las vegasedc vegasezekiel elliot edcEzekiel ElliotthandcuffedNFLwatchWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

Ekali brought out Illenium, who was also playing the festival, near the end of his set to assist with the unreleased magic.

But when you crank up those speakers at home or attend a show, it’s important to use protection.If you appreciate music, then appreciate your ears.

"EDC Arrest Report:Electric Daisy Carnival in Las Vegas has come and gone — and the arrest numbers for the weekend are in.When you take into account the 150,000 people attending the music festival each night, the amount of arrests pales in comparison to the good times had over the weekend. Still, a total of 12 misdemeanor arrests and a total of 51 “felony or gross misdemeanor” arrests occurred.It’s notable to point out EDC weekend only saw two DUI arrests in 2019. With the addition of Camp EDC and with the number of shuttle services from the city to the festival, DUIs have nearly been eliminated.EDC Las Vegas took place May 17-19 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. And, as broken down by the Reno Gazette Journalthe Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department kept tally on the arrests each night.Although no specifics on charges have been detailed yet, here are the numbers…FridayMisdemeanor citations: 1

"Yesterday marked the first day of 2019’s EDC Las Vegas. An estimated 150,000 people filed into the Las Vegas Motor Speedway between 7pm to 5:30am last night, making this easily the biggest EDC Las Vegas in history. Updated stage from kineticFIELD to cosmicMEADOW to bassPOD kept the scenery looking fresh, and acts like i_o, Skream b2b Rusko, Alison Wonderland, deadmau5, and more kept fans’ attention all night long.Unfortunately, some choose to use the festival as an opportunity for more nefarious deeds. Las Vegas Metro police report making 25 felony arrests on night one of the festival on unspecified charges. Two more people were arrested for misdemeanors charges and one misdemeanor citation was issued, police said. No arrests were made for DUI or gross misdemeanors.This is actually good news, however, as even fewer people were arrested on night 1 this year compared to last year when fewer people attended the festival overall.Information about medical calls, unfortunately, was not immediately available to local news outlets.Night 2 of EDC Las Vegas begins tonight again at 7pm.

"Festival season is upon us and whether your music tastes are more in line with Coachella or Stagecoach — we should all be able to agree that these events should be a safe space. However, that’s far from the reality for many attendees.A new survey conducted by The Desert Sun reveals that one in six women were sexually harassed at these music festivals this year. The accounts are troubling to say the very least… – Rosie Makinen, 21She continues…Of the 323 women surveyed who attended either Coachella or Stagecoach, approximately 15 percent experienced sexual harassment. That number includes those who received “unwanted groping or touching,” like in Makinen’s case.This year, Goldenvoice introduced a new anti-harassment/anti-assault policy to help promote a safer experience for festival goers. However, most of these women affected didn’t hear of the policy and didn’t realize there were safe spaces for victims to go to deal with such distress.Often times at music festivals, we’re in close quarters with others in the crowd. It’s important to be aware of our surroundings and respectful of each other’s personal space. Change starts with us as individuals — but as a community, we can do better. USA TodayThe Desert Sun coachellafestival culturemusic festivalsSexual HarassmentStagecoachsurvey",articles6,"['Stagecoach', 'Stagecoach']"

"One of the reasons dance music is great is because of its vast diversity. Under the EDM umbrella exists dozens of different styles, tempos, and influences, and — if your fans are open to it — an artist can excel at many simultaneously.While Martin Garrix is primarily known for this house and electro stylings, throwing down some dubstep when you’re in the moment at EDC Las Vegas isn’t against the rules. During his set last night at circuitGROUNDS, Garrix hit the crowd with some heavier material and fans have been trying to figure out just what the hell it was.MARTIN GARRIX GOING HARD AT EDC!where are my headbangers at? 👽 pic.twitter.com/3ZMq8Tp6tW— MARTIN GARRIX HUB (@MartinGarrixHub) May 19, 2019Turns out, it was some unreleased Knife Party called “Lost Souls.” Seems Garrix has been branching out a bit!

"Pasquale Rotella, the mastermind behind EDC Las Vegas and the rest of Insomniac Events wasn’t as festival-ready as he would have liked to be last night. He needed a totem.As u/Shadynasty shares on Reddit, the legend spotted their group’s totem out of the crowd. Not only did he stop to admire it and take a photo, he bought it off them for a cool $200. We’re not sure how much it cost to construct the totem, but it sounds like a good deal for everyone involved.This is amazing and all, but commenters are wondering more about the totem. u/Shadynasty describes, “A 9foot PVC pipe with a 16ft string of led lights. I made a 12v power supply out of vape batteries. This thing was bright as fuckkkkk, remote included!”Only at EDC.

It’s always refreshing to hear a DJ take their craft outside the norm — and Alison is able to do so like a pro.

"The second night of EDC Las Vegas was filled with some pretty epic moments, including a surprise set from Skrillex, plenty of surprise sets on the art cars (San Holo at Forest House, anyone?), and more. Unfortunately, much of the night was marred by high winds which prevented the fireworks display or pyrotechnics at many stages, and actually caused a couple stages to shut down.KineticField was one of the stages that shut down due to the high winds, during Kaskade’s set, in addition to QuantumValley. However, some unclear language at the stage alerting headliners of the winds led to some terrible issues. the messaging read. Note the use of the word “venue” rather than “stage.” It continues, Insomniac attempted to curb the outpouring of attendees with the tweet below, emphasizing, “We are not evacuating the venue.” However, for many, it was already too late.We are experiencing high winds and as a precaution have shut down a couple of stages at this time. We are actively monitoring the situation but we are not evacuating the venue.— EDC (@EDC_LasVegas) May 19, 2019By the time EDC issued the tweet below, telling attendees they could re-enter the venue — never having  to exit the venue in the first place — many had already gotten in line for their shuttles, made it back to their cars, or even as far as the Strip.Hi Headliners! You may re-enter the venue if you have already left. We are not shutting down the entire venue, only a few stages. Please let us know if you have any issues re-entering the festival and we will work swiftly to get you back in.— EDC (@EDC_LasVegas) May 19, 2019Incorrect messaging was displayed at kineticFIELD instructing Headliners to evacuate the venue. All Headliners who were asked to evacuate will be allowed to re-enter the venue.— EDC (@EDC_LasVegas) May 19, 2019“We’re not evacuating the venue” you literally told us that you were!!! pic.twitter.com/BhoJvyuWdU— Donoxan (@basedonnydarkoo) May 19, 2019Yeah… already back at the shuttle stop because you literally said to evacuate the whole venue.— Nick DeCinque (@nickdecinque) May 19, 2019The wording in the Kinetic Field stage said VENUE was being evacuated, not stage. So we hopped on our premier shuttle and am back at the hotel already. Lost half the night.— Rowena (@rowiecun) May 19, 2019Kaskade eventually made it back to the camp grounds for a surprise sunrise set, but many who wished to see him and others on the main stage unfortunately were not as lucky.Day 3 of EDC Las Vegas begins today at 7pm. A wind advisory is in effect until 8pm with reports of winds at 25 to 35 mph with gusts of 40 to 50 mph. How that will affect tonight’s festivities remains to be determined.  edcEDC 2019edc closureedc shutdownedc stagesvegasLover of all bass music.

"The future is here and so is Madonna.The pop icon’s new song with Quavo rocks production credits from Diplo, and while she’s clearly taking notes from modern trends in popular music, Madonna refuses to lose her signature appeal.“Future” is recognizably a Diplo song by design, with infectious rhythm and a horn section to keep the track moving. Count on Madonna for the deeper-than-surface-level lyrical performance, and Quavo to bring the flavor.At first, Madonna’s essence seems to be a little lost in this collaborative mix, but she manages to break through. Recycling lyrics from “Don’t Tell Me,” the Madonna we all know and love proves she’s here — for now and into the future.Madonna says of “Future” featuring Quavo, “It’s a song about the world that we live in today and the future of our civilization.”Listen here. collabcollaborationdiploFuturemadonnaQuavoWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Attendees at EDC Las Vegas 2019 are on their best behavior. After yesterday’s already historically low arrest count, the numbers for day two have come in and they’re even lower than the first day.According to LVMPD, during normal festival hours, only 14 attendees were arrested. Adding to Friday’s 27, that brings this weekend’s total up to a very minuscule 41 total when compared to the approximately 300,000 people who have come through the festival so far.Last year, LVMPD reported that 33 people were arrested on drugs charges during the second night of the festival. By all accounts, it seems that attendees this year are taking it easier and not getting into as much trouble, which is good news for everyone.  edcEDC 2019edc arrestsedc night 2electric daisy carnival arrestsLover of all bass music.

And, according to Wikipedia, it’s 74 acres in total and stretches from 5th to 15th Streets. This is more than twice the potential size of Ultra’s longtime home at Bayfront Park (only 32 acres).A meeting on the matter is scheduled for May 22nd, and it comes on the heels of Ultra promising to leave Miami after abandoning its one-off location in 2019 on Virginia Key.

"DJ Mag has a thing for polls. Between its Top 100 DJs and Top 100 Clubs polls, it has the market generally cornered. This year, the publication decided to switch things up a bit, and rather than ask its readers and followers about their favorite festivals, to ask the DJs themselves instead.Thus the DJ Mag’s Top 50 Festivals 2019 list was conceived. Obviously, the list is still slightly weighted toward DJs who’ve been included in DJ Mag’s lists already, though it says they included “a huge list of others from right across the dance music spectrum — from house to techno, drum & bass to hardstyle — to make sure the list was as comprehensive as possible.” What you get is a list of 50 great festivals straight from the horses mouths; though, to say a DJ’s experience at a festival is comparable to that of anyone attending is a stretch at the very least.Nevertheless, it’s interesting to look through the list and see where your own favorite festivals rank among the global scale.

With, again, The Glitch Mob, Slander, NGHTMRE, and Seven Lions all on one track, there’s no telling how amazing this will be.Another guess — it’s an entire tour, which is a collaboration of sorts.

There was no real cliff hanger to leave fans on like there had been at the end of Season 2; yet, one is never really necessary for a show like this, fans simply want more.This morning, Adult Swim posted a short animated clip featuring Rick and Morty telling followers about a big announcement they had to make, the show’s anticipated return date for season four. It will be more than two years since the last episode aired, making it the longest gap between seasons yet. (From end of Season Two to beginning of Season Three was 18 months.)Fans were hoping for an “accidental” release of season four on April Fool’s this year, like the network had done for season three, but no dice. Still, it’s good to know we have something to look forward to in November.We heard some of you were interested in this information. #WarnerMediaUpfront @rickandmorty pic.twitter.com/UkUINBmw9a— [adult swim] (@adultswim) May 15, 2019 adult swimannouncementnovember 2019premiere dateRick and MortyRick and morty season 4Rick and morty season fourseason fourLover of all bass music.

"It’s been a relatively light year for Zeds Dead so far on the release front, apart from their collaboration on Delta Heavy’s album, “Lift You Up.” But now, well into May, the duo are here with their first lead single of 2019, with some help from Dion Timmer and Delaney Jane, “Rescue.”The sound on “Rescue” is immediately reminiscent of the sonic styles the group explored on their debut album in 2014, sort of a mix between “Lights Out” and “Stardust.” Delaney brings her own vibe to the release with her instantly recognizable voice, and Dion Timmer adds a little weight to the drops, but this sounds like a classic Zeds Dead tune as much as it can be.“Rescue” is out now via Deadbeats!

"Earlier today a few eagle-eyed EDC Las Vegas-goers spotted what appears to be a brand new billboard just off the freeway highlighting none other than a confused-looking San Holo. The billboard was pretty succinct and only featured the words “Lost Lately” with a phone number below. Of course, doing what any reasonable people would do, we called the number as soon as we could.Calling the number took us to a voicemail from San himself where he talked about feeling ‘lost lately’ and how that had inspired him to create a song, aptly titled “Lost Lately” which he would release on June 13th before fading into a short preview. There’s also a bitbird logo on the billboard which leads us to believe that the song will be released on San’s own label once again. Unfortunately other details on the song remain scarce for now but what we do know is that June 13th is coincidentally also the date of San’s debut Red Rocks show so that’s something to keep in mind.Call the number for yourself here: +1 818 583 8499 and if you’re around for EDC be sure to check out his set at Kinetic Field on Sunday evening.

"You know that saying — you’re never too old. Well David Attenborough is truly young at heart. At the ripe age of 93, he’s tapping into dance music.Decades ago, Attenborough stumbled upon a Balinese tribe playing music that he’s never been able to get out of his head. He took out his trusty tape recorder and captured the music, which he has held dear all this time. Surprisingly, the sounds of the tribe still ring in crystal clear.“The villagers play this concerted music with extraordinary precision and real zest,” he explains to BBC. “So it is haunting music that you hear every night — or you did in those days, in the villages of Bali.”“So these sounds which I captured with that clumsy tape recorder 60 years ago have a quality that you wouldn’t be able to replicate today.”Now, he wants to bring the same music to younger generations — but he needs the help of a producer. He’s recruiting someone to transform the music he heard into something more suitable for a main stage at Tomorrowland.Enter “My Field Recordings from Across the Planet” here via PRS Foundation. LAD Bible competitiondavid attenboroughMy Field Recordings from Across the PlanetremixWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Rolling Loud was a bit chaotic this year to say the very least. Rapper Kodak Black was taken into custody, the crowd rushed the stage during a weather delay, and a golf cart was stolen and driven through the audience, etc.All of this could have been easily deflected. However, someone at Rolling Loud decided to deal with the bad press in the worst possible way. Taking to Twitter, the official account blurted out a bunch of tasteless, borderline embarrassing posts and was ultimately suspended from the platform.According to Reddit, when a fan complained that Kid Cudi’s set wasn’t live streamed, the festival snapped back: “should’ve bought a ticket.” Well, ok then.Not exactly sure what happened here.

"The nation’s most restrictive anti-abortion laws just passed in Alabama and Georgia — and DJs are speaking out on this issue, as well as women’s rights in general.Not only is it terrifying that women choosing to abort may be held liable for felony murder, the severe lack of exceptions is startling. In Alabama, exemption in cases of rape and incest has failed to pass.Under the new law, absolutely no abortion may take place after 20 weeks, unless the woman’s health is at risk. Abortion is punishable up to 99 years, or life in prison.Many view this as a direct attack on women’s rights and personal freedom. It’s devastating to see these states taking a huge step back from progression.See some of the arguments from the EDM community below.Hey ALL MEN, right now is a prime time to be an ally.

"Woodstock 50 has been fighting an uphill battle the past month, after passing its expected on-sale date and then having multiple issues inherent to the festival exposed, among having its main investor pull out and “cancel” the festival.However, the festival is lucky as a judge in New York Supreme Court has ruled that investor Dentsu Aegis Network did not have the capacity to completely cancel the festival on its own. That being said, it’s mostly a legal victory as Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang still reportedly has to find $30 million in funding.While the judge ruled that Dentsu couldn’t cancel the festival outright, it was also ruled that the investment company did not have to return the $17.8 million it took from their joint account to Woodstock. That, in addition to the fact that W50 still has not secured the proper permits for the festival during the rigmarole.A talent agency head previously told , “We’re not even going to have a discussion with Lang until we see that every permit needed for this event has been secured. I’d also like to hear how he plans to convince fans to buy tickets for an event that’s been already canceled.”Yet somehow, Lang still seems confident that the festival will take place. “We have always relied on the truth and have never lost faith that the Festival would take place,” Lang said in a statement reacting to the judge’s decision. “I would like to thank all of the talent and their representatives for their patience and support. Woodstock 50 will be an amazing and inspiring festival experience.”As of right now, Woodstock 50 will still take place August 16th-18th in Watkins Glen, New York. H/T  50th anniversarydentsu aegisfundinginvestorjudgeMoneyRulingWoodstockLover of all bass music.

"Discouraging phones at shows is not a new phenomenon. Artists as well-toured as Bruno Mars and Björk have told concert attendees to put their phones down, and DJ Lane 8 has gone so far as to ban phones outright during his  tour series. But for a festival to do it is not as common.FLY Open Air will be implementing a cell phone ban at its festival this weekend in Edinburgh, Scotland, though only to a degree. Phones will be banned solely at its Boiler Room stage — and anyone who’s familiar with the brand will likely tell you they’re completely okay with the move.Phones will be locked in a Yondr case as you enter the stage, and can easily be unlocked upon leaving. The idea is to get attendees to “live in the moment,” though it also likely has a lot to do with Boiler Room’s brand.We’ve decided to ban phones 📵 on our new @boilerroomtv stage Info on why & how in next tweet 😃 pic.twitter.com/wG0BqE9LvV— FLY Open Air (@openairfly) May 13, 2019How 👀 pic.twitter.com/s6XOqdn33N— FLY Open Air (@openairfly) May 13, 2019Why?

"The world has learned a lot from Fyre Festival — namely, how to prevent such an event from happening again and how to spot the warning signs when it seems like an event might be going down that same path. Now that information is coming out about Woodstock 50 during the course of a 2-day hearing in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, concluded today, W50 could have very easily gone that route.breaks the discovery down into eight crazy, bite size pieces, but the bulk of the discussion centers around whether investor Dentsu Aegis Network had the authority to unilaterally “cancel” the event by pulling out support.Woodstock co-founder Michael Lang filed a lawsuit against Denstu, claiming the investor illegally absconded with $17.89 million from a joint account, making it impossible to properly finance the festival. “[…] stop interfering with our efforts to put on this wonderful event, and return the $17 million you improperly took,” Lang wrote in a letter to Dentsu.But the massive investment arm doesn’t believe Lang has a leg to stand on.“Woodstock 50 LLC’s and Michael Lang’s misrepresentations, incompetence, and contractual breaches have made it impossible to produce a high-quality event that is safe and secure for concertgoers, artists, and staff,” Dentsu’s attorney Marc L. Greenwald wrote in a memorandum filed on Monday. “The production company has quit, no permits have been issued [hyperlink our own], necessary roadwork has not begun, and there is no prospect for sufficient financing… As much as the parties might wish it otherwise, the festival contemplated by their agreement cannot happen and allowing it to go forward would only put the public at risk.”As of now, Woodstock 50 is still scheduled for August 16–18 2019 at Watkins Glen, New York, but that could change as soon as within the next day, week, or month. A ruling on the hearing is expected within 24-48 hours.See a full timeline of the craziness that is Woodstock 50 here. hearingincompetencelawsuitWoodstockLover of all bass music.

Although temperatures will be cooler than in many years past, hydration concerns remain ever-present.Community Ambulance Director of Special Operations, Glen Simpson, urges EDC attendees to stay hydrated. That means drinking lots of water, and also staying fed while you’re out at the festival.EDC has been known to take place with temperatures reaching into the 100s. This weekend, the forecast for Las Vegas is looking much cooler, between mid 70s and low 80s. While it might feel more comfortable, you’re still going to be out there for hours and hours dancing, and it’s important to pay attention to what your body is telling you it needs.If you’re going out to EDC — pace yourself, get plenty of rest, look out for each other — and most importantly, stay hydrated out there.  edcElectric Daisy Carnivalhydrationlas vegassafetystay hydratedWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

From the looks of it, everyone seems to be having a good time, and Flume’s personal touch in the production clearly struck a chord with the birthday girl as she couldn’t help but continue to laugh and enjoy herself.While this will likely never be released, there are rumors of a new Flume mixtape coming June 21 — read more about that here. Watch the video from the birthday celebration below.  birthday partycustom songFlumenever releasedLover of all bass music. I'm not afraid to speak my mind and put it to paper, and I do it often.

"When it comes to making remixes, Tiësto is a machine! Just a couple days after Avicii‘s new song “Tough Love” dropped, and he was already playing out his own interpretation.Tiësto played EDC Japan over the weekend — the perfect testing grounds for his remix. We have to say, Tiësto’s version expertly rivals that of the original as he puts his own twist on the song. But, that’s when you get when you’re dealing with two greats such as these.So far, we’ve heard “SOS” and “Tough Love.” As we patiently await Avicii’s forthcoming album , there’s much more to be experienced off the producer’s posthumous release.As for Tiësto’s remix, we have to imagine an official drop is coming soon. Rukes.com aviciiedc japanremixtiestotimTough LoveWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Pioneer DJ‘s latest entry-level controller is the most affordable option yet! (Note: Pioneer DJ is still around for now.)The DDJ-200 is not only priced at $149/£139 — it links with streaming services including SoundCloud Go+ and Beatport LINK. So, beginner DJs can save money on music, too.The new controller is designed to run straight from your smartphone using Pioneer DJ’s WeDJ app. However, the DDJ-200 can also adapt to a more traditional setup with a laptop and music files.The DDJ-200 is one of the first controllers to push streaming and app-driven operations. Pioneer has partnered with Serato, Native Instruments, Virtual DJ and Mixvibes to making streaming options readily available for up-and-coming DJs.Streaming is the future — and this may be a sure sign of where the industry is headed.

"With Swedish House Mafia’s reunion now back in full swing, a lot of their most classic tracks hit a little harder, with a bit more emotion. On this day 8 years ago, arguably one of the trio’s biggest songs “Save The World” was released.Though it was originally premiered on BBC Radio 1 on April 22, 2011 by Pete Tong, it didn’t see an official digital release until May 13. Vocals from John Martin on the song remain off the official title, though his name does appear in the credits. This wasn’t uncommon for the time, though it does sort of suck.The hit was eventually nominated for Best Dance Recording in 2012, only to lose to Skrillex’s “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites.” That year, Skrillex took home 3 awards including Best Dance Recording, Best Album for  as well as Best Remix for his take on Benny Benassi’s “Cinema.”This year, you have plenty of chances to catch Swedish House Mafia on tour.

"More than 60 festivals across the UK have band together to help put a stop to single-use tents. The group is urging major retailers including Argos and Tesco to halt marketing such items.An estimated 250,000 tents are left at festivals across the UK each year, according to a report, amounting to 900 tons of plastic waste every festival season. If these tents were donated to charity it would be one thing, but the reality is much of these barely-used tents go straight to the landfill.The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) speaks on behalf of festivals like Shambala, Boomtown Fair and Boardmasters. All of which support the initiative to stop single-use tents and other plastic waste.In 2018, these music festivals pledged to cut down on plastic at events, resulting in a drastic cut to other single-use items like plastic straws, drink cups and more. A glitter ban was also instated across the 60+ festivals.AIF CEO Paul Reed said: “We call upon major retailers to stop marketing and selling tents and other camping items as essentially single-use, and profiting from disposable culture.”“The message here is not ‘buy a more expensive tent’… festival audiences can take positive action and reduce their carbon footprint simply by taking their tent home and reusing it, ensuring that it doesn’t become a single-use item this summer.”Here in the states, Electric Forest is making an effort with eco-friendly tents — but it’s a rather pricey option. Hopefully in the future we’ll see more of these at a more affordable price.In the meantime, if you buy a tent for a music festival — Please, please use it until it wears out or make sure it’s donated. Tents aren’t trash to leave behind. Sky News AIFAssociation of Independent FestivalscampingfestivalMusic FestivalUKWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"The love triangle between model Olivia Culpo, ex-boyfriend and football star Danny Amendola, and her new love interest, Zedd, is heating up.Let’s back up a bit though… Culpo and Zedd were first spotted together while getting cozy at Coachella. The flirty video made waves on the internet and clearly got under Amendola’s skin.He took to social media to dis his ex and her newfound romance. The Detroit Lions wide receiver also dished on their sex life — “The universe brought her and I together to enjoy life, love, and learn. We celebrated that as often as we could. And the sex was f*cking crazy too.” TMI.That, and he uploaded this video, showing off his washboard abs and clearly taking a jab at Zedd in the process… “Zed’s dead baby, Zed’s dead.”@DannyAmendola over here taking shots at @Zedd.

"I’m not sure why, but it feels like it’s been a while since I’ve heard new music from Whethan. It’s ironic because he just put out a new track at the end of March. But personal feelings aside, he did just drop a new track today, and it’s with Jeremih, and it’s pure house fun.Jeremih most recently offered his voice to dance music on RL Grime’s “Undo” with Tory Lanez, so his feature on this new Whethan tune is no small feat. Though, in fact, this track has been around “for a while now” says Whethan himself.Whethan says, “I had been sitting on this track with Jeremih for a while now and explored every possible version of the song before landing on this one. I’ve been really inspired by a lot of house music and wanted to find a way to bring that into my world. It was important to me that I made something that people could really dance too. This is probably my favorite track to date and I’m just excited to show my fans where the future of my music is headed.”Make no mistake, this is definitely a very easy track to dance to, bringing influences from house and Latin music into the mix for a sultry and sexy, groovy tune that just doesn’t let up.Check it out below.Whethan’s North American tour dates:June 14-15: Quincy, WA @ Paradiso Festival
June 27-30: Rothbury, MI @ Electric Forest

"It’s really easy to write a song with a bunch of relatable platitudes to evoke the reaction from listeners of, “Omg! That is so me!” What’s more difficult is to use nuance, real life experience, and a seasoned vocalist to create an emotional reaction in the music. If you were wondering, ILLENIUM’s new song with Jon Bellion, “Good Things Fall Apart,” falls squarely in the latter category.“GTFA” is instantly one of those timeless coming of age songs, something that you could picture being played in any of a number of young adult films in theaters. Imagining a montage of a group of friends running through a wheat field in the summer, or a young pair of friends finally realizing they have feelings for each other, comes as easy as putting one foot in front of the other.



These six lines are sung with a wealth of personal experience behind them, proving that Bellion was the perfect choice for this pop/electronic crossover.I’m sure that for some, this track might fall flat. Personally, this is already one of my favorite tracks of the year and I’ve had it on repeat. Listen to ILLENIUM & Jon Bellion’s “Good Things Fall Apart” below.[Verse 1]
Did I say something wrong?
Did you hear what I was thinking?
Did I talk way too long?
When I told you all my feelings that night
Is it you? Is it me?
Did you find somebody better?
Someone new? Isn’t me
‘Cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type[Pre-Chorus]
Over thinking’s got me drinking
Messing with my head, woah[Chorus]
Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I’m so sorry, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
Everybody said we had it, yeah, yeah[Post-Chorus]
I’m coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart[Verse 2]
When you said it was real, yes, I really did believe it
Did you fake how you feel?
When we broke down by the river that night, that night
That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend’s car
‘Cause we couldn’t leave the windows down in December
Woah, woah, oh, oh[Chorus]
Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I’m so sorry, (No one said) yeah, (No one said) yeah
I know I can be dramatic
Everybody said we had it, yeah, yeah[Post-Chorus]
I’m coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart[Pre-Chorus]
Over thinking’s got me drinking
Messing with my head, woah[Chorus]

"Florida rapper Kodak Black was arrested at Rolling Loud Music Festival over the weekend on firearm charges.According to Miami-Dade Police, he was taken into custody on Saturday, upon arrival to the music festival before he was able to perform. He was taken into custody on federal charges and faces legal implications from the state as well.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was the lead on the case. U.S. Marshals explained the arrest was made following “an extensive investigation conducted by the U.S. Marshals, ATF and Miami-Dade Police Department’s North Side Gang Unit.”Black, real name Bill Kapri, was also arrested last month on drug and weapon-related charges when he tried to cross from Canada into the United States.His charges following Saturday’s incident have not yet been officially confirmed.Just obtained photo of Bill Kapri, AKA Rapper Kodak Black after he was arrested tonight.

"Rain or shine, Rolling Loud is going down, but not without some chaos.The weather in Miami has been a huge factor this weekend, causing extended delays for many performances. Instead of waiting patiently for music, fans literally rushed the stage earlier today to make their own party (see below).There was also a hijacking of a golf cart that took place, in which the driver pulled up straight through the crowd to get a prime spot for the next set. All of this is captured on video (see below).Just yesterday, there was a “false alarm” at Rolling Loud, an apparent rumored shooting that sent attendees running from the grounds. Yikes.Not only that, Kodak Black was arrested on Saturday for firearm charges.Rolling Loud has clearly gotten out of hand. However, the music festival has done its best to keep to schedule.

"We stan a parent who stands up for their kid. Recently, Whipped Cream’s dad, Bob Cecil, recently dove into the comments on his daughter’s Instagram to fend off some naysayers doubting her ability to really DJ.“Is your set prerecorded?” asked @cold_world_arsonist. “U do so much jumping around how do u stay on point?”Clearly, Bob didn’t take kindly to someone assuming his daughter wasn’t putting in the prerequisite work. He responded: “most tracks she plays will [be] from 10 sec to maybe longest 30 secon. It’s all done through beat matching feeling matching to keep the show at max throughout. The movement and being [in] shape comes from 12 years of competitive figure skating.”Honestly, I’ve been a fan of Whipped Cream since I first saw her at HARD Summer 2017, opening up the Green tent at 12:30 and packing it out. Seeing her rise has been nothing short of enjoyable, and I’m glad she has the support from her parents, as well, to keep her motivated.If you’re interested in seeing Whipped Cream live to see what all the fuss is about, check her tour schedule here.Hahahahahaha my dad on Instagram talking to people who question me actually being able to DJ pic.twitter.com/WKuDPehveT— WHIPPED CREAM (@WHIPPEDCREAM) May 9, 2019  bob cecildaughtersinstagramparentsStand UpWhipped CreamLover of all bass music.

One of the biggest of them all celebrates its 6 year anniversary today, “Reload” from Sebastian Ingrosso and Tommy Trash with John Martin.The original was released months earlier in September 2012, but the addition of Martin’s voice is what catapulted “Reload” into the realm of classics. That, of course, and the unparalleled melody.John Martin had previously worked with Ingrosso on Swedish House Mafia’s “Don’t You Worry Child,” so getting him on “Reload” was a no-brainer.Listen again below. Rukes.com Anniversaryjohn martinprogressive housereloadsebastian ingrossosix yearstommy trashLover of all bass music.

"North Dakota just quietly became the 25th state to decriminalize weed.As Marijuana Moment and advocacy group NORML have pointed out, a bill decriminalizing marijuana was signed into law last week. For whatever reason, this happened with little-to-no media coverage.This is by no means legalization for North Dakota residents, but the penalties for possession are far less. Moving forward, first-time possession up to a half an ounce is no long classified as a criminal demeanor. Instead, a minor infraction like this would carry a fine instead of jail time.One Redditor points out that full legalization has been on North Dakota’s ballot multiple times. Some believe the decriminalization is an effort to stall or sway the push for legalization.This comes days after Denver decriminalized magic mushrooms. Being the first state to legalize marijuana, Colorado has always been ahead of the rest. Vox decriminalizedlawlegalizationMarijuanaNorth DakotaweedWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Back in September last year, Diplo earmarked the end of Major Lazer in 2019. Speaking to , he revealed, “Next year marks our last album, so we got a lot of stuff in between now and then.”In the meantime, we’ve gotten a full album from LSD, new music from Diplo solo, including a country collaboration with Cam and a house EP, and even a short Major Lazer EP focusing more on African artists and beats. But now, we have the first single from the forthcoming fourth and final Major Lazer album.Out today is “Can’t Take It From Me” with Skip Marley, co-produced and co-written with Nitti Gritti. It has the same qualities of any great Major Lazer tune, with Marley’s soft and easy voice coupled with some anthemic horns and a delectable melody. As we’re already in May, it’s safe to expect a lot more Major Lazer soon before the album drops this year.Check out “Can’t Take It From Me” from Major Lazer with Skip Marley below.  can't take it from mefinal albumfirst singlefourth albummajor lazerNitti Grittiskip marleyLover of all bass music.

"Canada’s Ever After Music Festival is changing the game by allowing the possession and consumption of cannabis on-site. This is the first major music festival to do so across the country and accomplish what no major U.S. festival has done thus far.On a smaller scale, festivals like Northern Nights in California will tested out the same kind of policy a month later. The main difference being cannabis will not be sold at Ever After — the festival is only allowing attendees to bring in their own product. Still, Ever After, located in Kitchener, ON, is a sizable guinea pig for the area.In 2018, Canada legalized marijuana, so it only makes sense that festival culture would embrace the freedom to smoke down. Selling weed, however, is not allowed on festival grounds.Below, Ever After details the full policy, which allows anyone 19+ to smoke in the designated smoking areas – cannabis cannot be used in areas where food or alcohol are also sold. Individuals are allowed to keep a ton of weed on their person — 10 grams per person in the festival and 28 grams per person at camp.If you want to check out Ever After, the event has a killer lineup and goes down June 7 – 9. CTV News cannabisEver AfterMarijuanaMusic Festivalsmoking policyweedWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Marshmello released “Light It Up” with Chris Brown & Tyga on April 25 and was immediately struck with criticism from across the musical landscape. Not least of all was the condemnation from band CHVRCHES, with whom Marshmello had just collaborated on their song “Here With Me.”“We like and respect Mello as a person but working with people who are predators and abusers enables, excuses and ultimately tacitly endorses that behavior,” the band wrote. “That is not something we can or will stand behind.”Brown responded, saying he wished they’d walk in front of a speeding bus.Yet, throughout all the rigmarole, Marshmello stayed silent (true to his character). He finally broke his silence, though rather stealthily, when Justin Bieber posted on Instagram this past weekend with an image likening Brown to the combination of Michael Jackson and 2Pac.It was a simple response from Marshmello, a comment on the image, just four “100” emojis. But it’s more than enough to show where he stands on the issue at hand. TJ Smith, a popular singer/songwriter, YouTuber, and Twitch stream replied, “This ain’t it, dude. Whoever’s running your social media, this post ain’t the one to be posting support for. You preach love. Nearly killing someone ain’t love.”His comment currently has more than double the support that Marshmello’s original comment does.Ultimately, it’s unlikely that Marshmello ever will make any sort of official statement regarding the controversy. But silence speaks volumes, as well. Rukes.com Chris BrownCHVRCHEScommentjustin biebermarshmellosilenceLover of all bass music. I'm not afraid to speak my mind and put it to paper, and I do it often.

"Denver just got a lot more… magical!A measure just passed to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms, more commonly known as psychedelic or “magic” mushrooms, in the city of Denver. The same city that happens to boast one of the best venues on earth: Red Rocks.Initiative 301 allows possession or use of magic mushrooms by individuals who are at least 21. Specific language prohibits “the city from spending resources to impose criminal penalties.” The idea behind this is to keep users out of jail.“No one deserves to go to jail and lose their family, their livelihood, their jobs for something that has a therapeutic benefit,” said Decriminalize Denver campaign manager Kevin Matthews ahead of the vote.According to the tally released on Wednesday, this measure passed by just 1,979 votes. The tally will be finalized and officially certified on May 16.The federal government still classifies psilocybin mushrooms as an illegal drug. However, that hasn’t stopped Colorado in the past.The state of Colorado became the first to allow recreational marijuana in January 2014. Now, Denver has become the first US city to decriminalize mushrooms.

"Yesterday in a landmark vote, Denver chose to decriminalize magic mushrooms, and in effect, their active psychoactive ingredient, psilocybin. A naturally occurring plant, magic mushrooms have been used for centuries and are currently a federally classified Schedule I drug. However, so is cannabis, and that didn’t stop Colorado from becoming the first state to legalize that, either.As much as we like to separate music from drugs, it’s no secret that electronic dance music and its fans like to make use of experience enhancing substances, including mushrooms.

"It’s been nearly a year since FISHER released his massive hit “Losing It,” which has earned him more festival spots than he can count, as well as a GRAMMY nomination. Now, for his first release of 2019, FISHER offers up “You Little Beauty,” a down to Earth simple house tune with all the FISHER embellishments we’ve come to love.But when you have a track like “Losing It,” it’s a bit of a double-edged sword. It nets you a lot of followers and fame, but leaves you with a huge task of putting out something bigger next. Is “You Little Beauty” that song? Hard to say, but personally, I don’t think so. It’s a pretty simple house beat and it has some flourishes that we’d expect from FISHER, but ultimately it’s a party house song.That also isn’t to say that FISHER is a modern day da Vinci. We don’t expect him to push the genre forward with innovative productions; he’s the producer we love to hate, the frat party hero, the hilarious Aussie. And “You Little Beauty” does the job its meant to do, so maybe it’s on me to just lighten up a bit.Either way, FISHER’s first release and his first song since “Losing It,” “You Little Beauty,” is out now.  catch & releaseFisherfun houseLosing Ityou little beautyLover of all bass music.

"Rather than wait for the City of Miami to convene tomorrow and offer its own vote to the fate of Ultra Music Festival, the festival dropped the hammer today and officially “voluntarily terminated” its license with the city.Now, the question goes to where the festival will end up in 2020. In its letter, Ultra said, “We have been approached by many interested parties over the years with offers to host the festival at some very unique and impressive locales. One of these, however, has shined far above the others, and we look foward to making our home there for many years to come.”According to the Miami Herald, that venue could be the Homestead-Miami Speedway, around 30 miles southwest of Miami.Writes the , “Their next stop might be Homestead. City Manager George Gretsas told the Herald he was made aware of conversations between Ultra and the Homestead-Miami Speedway.”“It is our expectation that at some point, they will formally submit a proposal,” Gretsas said.Of course, it still remains to be seen if such a prediction comes true, but the Speedway is a strong possibility among guesses for the next longterm Ultra venue.  conjecturehomestead-miami speedwaymiamiNew Venuerumorultraultra miamiultra music festivalultra new locationLover of all bass music.

The new song, “Tough Love,” features Agnes, Vargas & Lagola in a beautiful Indian-influenced duet.Avicii has never been one to shy away from challenging popular or expected styles, and this track is no different. Much like his song “Wake Me Up,” which was initially widely panned and went on to become a worldwide hit, Avicii had an innate ability to see beyond current trends and see what we all loved about music in the first place.“Tough Love” may not be the Avicii song we wanted, but it’s the one we need.Listen below.  agnesarabicaviciiindianTough LoveVargas & LagolaLover of all bass music.

"In order for Woodstock 50 to be saved, the music festival needs to raise another $30 million by Friday, according to multiple reports.Though music fans have become increasingly skeptical of the event, founder Michael Lang is still reassuring the public that the festival will go on. Recently, he has gone on a “media blitz” with over half a dozen publications to ensure people know it’s not over — yet.However, the music festival will need to pony up another $30 million by this Friday to keep the 3-day event from being canceled. Otherwise, more headliners are sure to pull out, resulting in a domino effect.There are more complications in addition to these financial woes. Lang says CID Entertainment is on board to produce the event, taking over for Superfly. However, CID has yet to confirm such a development.In addition, Woodstock 50 still has yet to secure a mass-gathering permit for the festival. Another huge red flag.The original funder, Dentsu Aegis previously pulled out and canceled the event altogether. Lang immediately snapped back, arguing the company didn’t have the power to do so. Now, he’s taking legal action.In a letter to Woodstock 50’s original investors, Lang writes: “Honor the law and your obligations, stop interfering with our efforts to put on this wonderful event, and return the $17 million you improperly took.”Lang and his new attorney have launched a claim against the company, claiming it “illegally swept approximately $17 million from the festival bank account.”Acquiring an emergency $30 million in funding is most definitely the “Hail Mary” pass for Woodstock 50.

This year was no different, with plenty of special moments throughout both weekends. Even for those of us watching the live stream at home, nearly 70 artists streamed their full sets including Billie Eilish, Gesaffelstein, Zedd, Weezer, NGHTMRE, Dillon Francis, and of course all the headliners.This was the first year that both weekends were going to be live streamed in full, but clearly everyone was still more excited for the first weekend. Weekend One of the live stream this year was the most-viewed to date with about 82.9 million live views. That’s the highest viewership for the festival’s streaming since YouTube began its exclusive broadcasts of Coachella in 2011 from the Empire Polo Grounds in Indio, CA, and up more than 90% from 2018, according to YouTube.Weekend Two featured a “curated” schedule of artists, featuring more from the Yuma tent, as well as a slightly modified list from the other stages.Coachella latest contract with YouTube will see its live stream on the platform exclusively through 2021.  coachellalive streamrecordviewersyoutubeLover of all bass music.

"Sometimes when we’re feeling sad, we enjoy putting on sad music. In some cases, it might actually make us feel better — but why is that? New research suggests that people with depression can benefit from listening to tearjerkers when they’re already down.A recent study published in Emotionsought to build upon an earlier 2015 study that found depressed people enjoyed listening to sad music over happy tunes. For the new study, researchers played music for 76 female undergrads at the University of South Florida. Half of them were depressed, the other half not so much.Just like in 2015, participants feeling depressed preferred hearing sad music to match their mood. For example, Samuel Barber’s “Adagio for Strings” was one of the offerings, which is universally recognized as “extremely depressing.”There’s more — not only did subjects enjoy the more melancholic selections, they expressed that the music made them feel better. Relaxing, calming effects were reported from the study, which further supports the notion that sad songs can be instant mood boosters.There are obvious limitations here, obviously including the all-female pool of participants. Though this study was conducted on a small scale, there’s still something to be taken away from the research in relation to music therapy. The Verge depressedDepressionemotionhappy musicmusic therapysad musicStudyUniversity of South FloridaWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Steve Aoki is one of the hardest working visionaries in the entertainment industry. With a never-ending queue of projects and endorsements, he’s always onto the next big thing. This time, it’s a newly launched comic book he’s promoting.The new series, “Neon Future,” named after his series of albums, imagines a future where humans live in harmony with technology. Rather than the dystopian setting many science fiction stories focus on, Aoki sees the future much differently. In collaboration with award-winning writer Jim Krueger, with art by Neil Edwards and Jheremy Raapack, he tells his story.Aoki explains his optimistic point of view:“Neon Future” takes place approximately 30 years from now in the US. The country has outlawed advanced technology and a long-haired, bearded Asian-American man named Kita Sovee leads the resistance — that “just so happens” to be an anagram of Steve Aoki’s name. The DJ/producer/entrepreneur admits he strives to be like the main character in his comic book.Aoki further explains:“Neon Future” is available now through Comixology and Impact Theory. The six issues will eventually be released as a graphic novel, according to a report.Get your copy here. AP via News Advance Comic BookComixologyImpact TheoryNeon Futuresteve aokiWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"Space Laces dropped an unreleased track last night at Stereo Live Dallas, which some believe is a “Phone Tap VIP” and many others believe is a Skrillex collab.At this moment, we can’t confirm or deny either way. However, we can guarantee it’s one of the most insane things you’ve ever heard. If it’s just Space Laces in the mix, then he has a banger on his hands. If Skrillex is involved, this will undoubtedly be one of the biggest collabs of the year.Considering only Skrillex and Space Laces have dropped the track during their sets, it seems as though this is the work of both producers. Only time will tell.If you think this sounds good, just wait until we hear an official release. Fingers crossed, anyways.

"Walk into any club in the world, and you’ll likely see a pair of some iteration of CDJ-2000s and a DJM-900 on the DJ booth. The Pioneer mixers are a standard worldwide, controlling between 60-70% of the global market of DJ mixers. However, according to reports from Japanese financial websites, it appears that Pioneer is in talks to sell off the remainder of its DJ subsidiary.Pioneer actually already sold 85% of its DJ arm to investment firm KKR & Co. in 2015, however financial troubles from its parent company seem to have called for the sale.Pioneer DJ did over $200 million in sales in 2018, but its parent company reported net losses in 2016 and 2017. Furthermore, Pioneer was recently bailed out during a restructuring process out by Baring Private Equity Asia, a Hong Kong buyout firm, to the tune of $930 million. In the process, Pioneer laid off 3,000 of its employees.According to , bidding has already begun with an expected price to land between “60 billion to 70 billion yen,” which is upwards of $500 million USD. Resident Advisor 500 million USDbiddingdjjapankkrpioneersaleLover of all bass music.

"It’s been a little over a month and a half since Flume made his grand return with his mixtape and following single, “Friends.” After announcing a show at Red Rocks for August, he went relatively quiet again, but not before he told fans that there was a lot more coming this year.Well, fans believe the next new music is coming very soon, and their reasoning makes sense, at least in a purely circumstantial way. A thread on /r/Flume on Reddit suggests new music is coming June 21, the first day of summer.If you look back at , two things work in tandem: the mixtape was released on the first day of spring, March 20, and the final track is titled “Spring.” This has led fans to believe that Flume’s next release, whether it’s another whole mixtape, an EP, or even just a single, will come on the first day of summer, June 21.Another user suggests that there’s speculation owing to the four squares at the top left of the  artwork, supposing they symbolize the seasons, or maybe the themes, of three following releases.In an even stranger string of events, Flume recently posted a picture of himself on Instagram with some goats. He tagged one of the goats in his caption as @totesmgoats1. That account is set to private, but has its bio set as “Hay This Is Goat (Mixtape) out 6.21.19.” Then to make things even stranger, the account hosted an AMA on its Stories and said to “mark your calendar” for a new mixtape.However, all of this remains speculative and circumstantial. We’ll know either way come June 21, or sooner even.

"Is anyone else still sore from the blast of high-grade neurofunk remixes that came from part one of the Neosignal remix album? Well, with that gun still smoking, the imprint are pressing on with part 2, already due out at the end of this month on May 29. It will feature remixes of Neisognal classics by Mefjus, Culprate, Buunshin, Yunis and our premiere today, the Joe Ford remix of Phace and Misanthrop’s neuro anthem, “Energie.” Strap in.The original mix of “Energie” sort of blew the DnB when it was released in 2011 with its crazy intro which took up half the track dropped into the main beat with no buildup, its thundering drum loops, basically no break and an unexpected outro that went from abject silence to ambient sound design to 80s synths before ending in a turntable powerdown. Structure-wise, it turned DnB on its ear but despite its complexity it is still regularly played in clubs today, eight years later.Speaking of turning things on their ear, that’s what Joe Ford has done with his remix of “Energie.” The intro is shorter than the original while the track itself is a full minute longer. The sine wave structure of the synths is accentuated, blown out and is shifted over to the downbeat rather than having a quarter beat pause. These may seem like subtle differences but they make the track sound like it has a totally different synth melody. With regard to the famed double-barrel drum loop of the original, Ford has rearranged that as well, removing it from every bar and re-inserting slightly different versions of it at the phrase transitions.The famed silence-cum-sound design-cum-80s synth outro is revampped as a break with yet again more blown out, cinematic-sounding synths. Ford then tacks about of extra minute onto the end of the track, using the classic stems to create two new beat structures: one that has the same phrasing at the original and a second that’s more minimal and deconstructs the famed sine wave synth even further. The two new structures loop around each other until the end, where the track drops off suddenly with an ambient flourish.The Joe Ford version of “Energie” is a masterful remix of the original and, not that we needed any more portends of what’s to come in part two of is a great indication of the level of quality that will continue to roll out from this anniversary remix celebration from Neosignal. It stands to reason, after all, that the remixes would have to be absolute fire to stand up to the jaw-dropping originals. As the first preview of part two, Joe Ford has more than lived up to the task.Part two of the  anniversary EP series from Neosignal will release on May 29. It can be pre-ordered and select tracks streamed by clicking here.

"Lots of songs end up sounding similar by the time they’re finally released — after millennia of compositions, there are only so many combinations left untouched. However, few are deemed close enough to be worthy of a lawsuit for copyright infringement. That being said, Arty is suing Marshmello for allegedly stealing elements from his remix of the One Republic song, “I Lived,” for the latter’s “Happier” with Bastille.In addition to Marshmello, the suit names his cowriters on the song, Daniel Campbell Smith, the cofounder of the British rock band Bastille, and Steve Mac as defendants.Arty and Marshmello share a music publisher, Kobalt Music, which is also a defendant in the suit.Writes , “Because the copyright lawsuit, filed in federal court in California, focuses only on the remixed elements of the song, the case is sure to grab attention in the music industry. Arty is represented by prominent Nashville copyright attorney Richard Busch, who has won a number of landmark cases, notably Marvin Gaye’s lawsuit against Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke over the song ‘Blurred Lines.'”According to the lawsuit, Marshmello could have become familiar with Arty’s remix because they frequently crossed paths. However, to be devil’s advocate, Arty’s remix was released in 2014. The Marshmello project did not debut until 2015.The lawsuit claims that Marshmello’s hit song “Happier,” which reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, directly copies from the “I Lived – Arty Remix.”By our own estimates, this is how the notes in the two tracks look side by side. (Arty is green, Marshmello in red.)“Everything we have to say is set out in detail in the complaint, including the compelling musical transcriptions comparing the two works,” Busch said.Listen to the two side by side below.

OWSLA was popping off and Skrillex was omnipresent. “Make It Bun Dem,” when it was released seven years ago today, followed the already wildly successful , , and  EPs, and only served to further catapult the burgeoning DJ’s illustrious career.When it was included in the game , that only made it more popular, and also exposed Skrillex to a whole new fanbase in the process.Where his tracks up until this point had been a mixture of brostep or electro house, this was the first time he had incorporated a bouncier, more moombah-like rhythm into his productions. Clearly, it had the intended effect and the song is now a veritable classic in his discography.Listen again below! Rukes.com AnniversaryDamian Marleymake it bun demmoombahseven yearsskrillexLover of all bass music.

"“There’s a little story in between all the songs. I feel like it’s kind of like 500 Days of Summer. It’s like if you’re watching that movie. Does it work out? Yes or No? Who knows. You’re in the journey and I think a big theme behind the album with the name “Everything Will Come Together” is trusting that it will work out the way that it’s meant to,” DJ/producer, Justin Jay, told Your EDM while discussing his upcoming double album releases.Launching his music career from his USC dorm room, Justin Jay has a passion for not only creating music but for creating a party vibe on and off the stage that is just as infectious as his tunes. You never know what you are going to get with a Justin Jay set. It’s this unique style of DJing/performing that makes sound crews stay up at night and while the crowd falls even harder for the curly haired and ever smiling DJ on the decks.“[Coachella] was really fun. I got to DJ and do some live stuff as well. I got to play at sunset and there were so many people there. I had so many friends on stage and in the crowd. My friends Benny Bridges and Andy Ammo joined me onstage. Andy plays the bongos and Benny plays guitar. They were hopping in and out I did it out and then the last 30 minutes of my set we played a bunch of songs off my new album together and yeah a little nervous but everything went really well. [Live shows are nerve racking] just making sure they are well rehearsed and stuff. With DJing you can kind of just go with the flow and feel it out and with live instruments, you got to practice your performance and I was super stoked with how it went. Also another thing that always is fun or challenging is the technical aspects of [a live set up] making sure the guitar works and the vocals sound okay, making sure everything’s plugged in and the sound guys are like ‘WHAT ARE YOU DOING.?’ and we’re like, ‘No, it’s gonna be fine. Don’t worry.’ It’s always the situation where they are like ‘We thought you were just a DJ.’ And I’m doing all this other stuff. I’m always trying to mix it up and have some fun.”I have personally seen both sides of Justin Jay onstage, whether he is performing a live Fantastic Voyage set or DJing, every Justin Jay set is definitely fun. When asked if he had a preference between the two styles of performance, Jay was hard-pressed to pick stating, “I like as much stuff as possible. Although I do love just DJing as well. I think a lot of it has to do with what’s [the set up] going to be… what’s the place and what friends of mine are free to roll through. There’s a lot of nightclubs where the DJ booth is super tiny so you can’t even fit a second person in there. And there are other times, like the Do Lab [stage] that is so great because it’s a big stage and the homies can be onstage dancing. I love that. When the booth is a part of the party. But even just DJing by myself is super fun. I get to do things I wouldn’t normally do if I was with my homies. Both are really really really awesome.”Aside from having his own successful label, Fantastic Voyages, Justin Jay is also s staple on Dirtybird Records and will be DJing a set at the upcoming landmark Dirtybird BBQ’s Los Angeles stop. When asked if it would be a live set or DJ set Justin Jay humbly responded, “At the moment, it’s just me.” Anyone who follows Justin knows that this is something that could always change, even if it happens the day of the show. As we went on to discuss Justin Jay’s history with Dirtybird BBQ and the upcoming Los Angeles event, he described why the event is special to him. “The Dirtybird BBQ’s are so much fun. Day party, food, music, and all my Dirtybird friends, it’s great. And last year was really special. [It] was the first year they did the BBQ in LA, [and it was held] at USC, which is where I went to college… and they lit the big torch in honor of Grillson and it was just this super profound moment. It was just a really great day, and I couldn’t be more excited about this next one.”Fans of Justin Jay also have his upcoming album release to look forward to. “[The new record] is the first part of this big project. It’s like a double album. The first half of the double album drops next month. It’s called . It’s been great. We’ve been putting out one song every month and we are four months in. Come May the first half of this double album is going to come out and a lot of it is really inspired by psychedelic rock and live music. I really wanted to learn how to play the guitar and I’m still learning but these are some of the first songs where I play the guitar. Benny Bridges helped me with some additional guitar. So if the guitar sounds crazy and hard to play it’s him. But it’s a good team effort. It was really fun to make and it’s kind of a snapshot of me like a year ago. Where I was. And the idea behind this whole album is… It sounds kind of silly, but it’s all about love. I feel like this first album is like… I don’t want to give spoilers, but take a listen to it. There’s a little story in between all the songs. I feel like it’s kind of like 500 Days of Summer. It’s like if you’re watching that movie. Does it work out? Yes or No… Who knows. You’re in the journey and I think a big theme behind the album with the name  is trusting that it will work out the way that it’s meant to. Which can mean, even at the end of 500 Days of Summer, even if they are just friends? That’s cool too. That’s the way it was meant to work. Letting go. And trusting that everything you need inside you’re gonna get it. And it’s going to come from within. I think a lot of the songs I was writing, [I wasn’t] really thinking about the big picture. I feel like things were happening, and music is so fun and awesome because if you are feeling something, whether it’s really great or really sad — either way making music just makes you feel better. It can make a sad moment a happy moment cause you just get it off your chest. Or if you’re happy, you can feel even happier. It’s simple but it [works]. Making music is the same as consuming it. Just the way it makes you feel. Love it.”These are words that I took very much to heart, and I can’t wait to get to hear the new songs from not only this first release but also when the second half comes out (timing of which is unknown as of yet) and we find out the end to the story. For this first half I asked Justin which song was the most fun to play onstage, he said “One of the songs that I think is really fun is “She’s Afraid to Choose.” It’s really fun because the vocals I did are really silly. It’s really fun. The band that I make music with called Thumpasaurus. I wanted to sing the way the singer in Thumpasaurus sings and he yells in really funny ways and that song is super funky. There’s also a song where I cleared a sample from the California Honeydrops. They are a really cool New Orleans soul band. They are going to be featured on it. It’s a super fun song.”The topic of vocals reminded me of something that I had always wondered. When I first started seeing Justin perform live and singing on the mic, I noticed that there were a lot of effects over the vocals. While it gave it a cool sound I was curious what the thought process was behind warping his vocals onstage. The question was received with a laugh, “Part of the reason why I was doing all that stuff was that I had never sang before and my singing was really bad. But then [overtime I would sing and] people were like ‘Wow. That’s the right note.’ So this album there are actually a lot more like naturally sounding vocal moments. I think there’s still a handful of like robot kind of voices. Which I just love that sort of vibe. I’m a big Daft Punk fan. This one, there’s more of a range.”If you can’t make it out to the BBQ in Los Angeles, you will have a chance to catch Justin Jay at a handful of the Fantastic Voyage shows he has lined up across the US in upcoming months. The last thing we spoke about was the possibility of another Fantastic Voyage house party in LA (they just need a new house!), and any upcoming plans he has for a tour. He said, “One thing I’m pretty excited for is after the album comes out we are going to do a full band tour. It’s going to be really fun. Our whole Fantastic Voyage crew is going to play as a band and a lot of the guys in the band are focusing on their own projects so DJ sets from Benny Bridges and Danny Goliger and Sam von Horn. It should be a really fun summer. Hopefully, a lot of the shows we do this summer will be like a mini version of what we did at [Dirtybird] Campout. Different homies going on and off the stage.Be sure to check out the new album as it is released on Fantastic Voyages website. You can follow all of Justin’s wild adventures on his Instagram, and be sure to check out the other homies mentioned in the interview: Benny Bridges and Andy Ammo, Sam von Horn, and Danny Goliger for more Fantastic Voyage fun. coachelladirtybirddirtybird bbqfantastic voyageJustin JayWe use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experience on our site, show personalized content

"As Bob Dylan so poignantly proclaimed in 1964: “The times, they are a changin’.” This year, Northern Nights Music Fest at Cooks Valley Campground in California will make history as the first three-day festival, the first camping festival, and first California sanctioned event outside of the state fairgrounds to allow recreational cannabis dispensing and consumption on-site.Located snug in California’s Emerald Triangle, considered the Napa Valley of cannabis, NNMF marks a new chapter in its history this year.Cannabis use will be allowed in the Northern Nights Tree Lounge recreationally for anyone who’s 21+ and medically for anyone with a valid medical card. The lounge will have 8-10 cannabis vendors to purchase product from, including the farmers themselves, so festival guests can purchase directly from the source and spark up educational conversations.“We are going to have a cannabis retail and consumption area that goes by the name of the Tree Lounge. It is 21 and over area and cannabis sales and consumption are restricted to that area,” says Northern Nights co-founder and compliance manager Peter Huson. “Essentially it is an onsite temporary dispensary. It has all the same rules you would have at a dispensary, it’s just inside a festival.”Writes , “California law does not allow for the recreational consumption of alcohol and cannabis in the same area, so Northern Nights has taken advantage of the fact that it resides in two counties. Cannabis consumption will be allowed on the Humboldt County side of the event, while alcohol consumption will be allowed on the Mendocino side without cannabis.”After you spark up, head to the exclusive stage in the Tree Lounge, or engage in CBD yoga. Other cannabis-infused activations will be sure to keep you stimulated and active at NNMF.Tickets are on sale now here, VIP and camping upgrades are also available as extra perks. The festival is held July 19-22. Kristina Baky californiacannabisemerald trianglefestivalnorthern nights music festrecreationalweedLover of all bass music.

"It’s been a few days now since Diplo’s groundbreaking set at Stagecoach Music Festival. Throughout the hour-long set, Diplo wove through EDM and classic country hits like nobody’s business, creating a literal one-of-a-kind set that likely no one else could have come up with.For example, mixing “Shakedown” from Uberjak’d & New World Sound into “Cotton Eyed Joe” — no one else would have the stones to do that. And then he followed it up with the absolute classic “Boot Scootin’ Boogy.” What a legend.Diplo wasn’t on stage by himself, though. During his set, he was joined by Cam, Sam Hunt, and last but certainly not least, Lil Nas X & Billy Ray Cyrus.This is easily one of the most interesting sets I’ve ever heard, and I’m confident you’ll say the same.

"A report earlier this month suggested that Instagram was testing out private like counts on its platform. The idea, Instagram said, was to encourage followers to “focus on the photos and videos [shared]” rather than the number of likes they get. “During this test, only the person who shared a post will see the total number of likes,” the company added.Now, the tests are going live — but just in Canada, for now.The design change was first spotted by Jane Manchun Wong twelve days before the test went public, but now some users are seeing it go into effect. The idea is that focusing less on likes will also have less of an impact on the mental health of Instagram users, many of whom are young and still very impressionable.There’s no word yet when Instagram might roll out the test to other territories — if at all — but many people, especially brands who pay influencers to help promote their products, aren’t happy about the change.Instagram has already frustrated businesses on its platform with constant algorithm changes, and this only serves to compound the issue.See what a private like count looks like below. instagrammental healthprivate likessocial mediaLover of all bass music.

"CHVRCHES have reportedly been forced to ramp up security following death threats from outraged Chris Brown fans. There’s now police at their shows and advance security when they step outside.The hip hop/pop singer’s following went absolutely berserk after the band spoke out against Marshmello‘s decision to collaborate with him and Tyga. Internet banter shifted into DM’d insults, and shifted into serious threats of rape and harm, aimed right at lead singer Lauren Mayberry.The entire situation has been a circus act ever since, but there’s a very real conversation to be had — whether or not music should hold individuals to a moral standard. Is it okay to regard art separately from the artist’s character — or, in this case, criminal offenses?Here’s what Mayberry has to say:She has a very compelling argument. No matter which side you’re on, violence and threats shouldn’t be brought into the conversation under any circumstances. As Mayberry says, that’s proving the point. The safety of everyone involved is absolutely vital.This comes after Marshmello and CHVRCHES released their collab together, “Here With Me.”See more below.pic.twitter.com/oAjbgGf1ef— CHVRCHΞS (@CHVRCHES) April 25, 2019I am not staying in my own home when we finish tour because the threats we have received have reached such a scale.

Now, fans are geeking out about a new collaboration the duo debuted at Ubbi Dubbi this past weekend with YOOKiE.There’s no track title on this one yet, but it could be titled “Rough” based on the pre-drop vocal sample.

			Hey there! Thanks for dropping by Sonic Fiction! Take a look around and grab the RSS feed to stay updated. See you around!May 12, 2019<blockquote class=”twitter-tweet” data-lang=”en”><p lang=”en” dir=”ltr”>I wasn't keen on ____________ until I saw them live.</p>&mdash; Rough Trade (@RoughTrade) <a href=” 12, 2019</a></blockquote>Ok, so this week’s Music Question courtesy of Rough Trade is “I wasn’t keen on ____________ until I saw them live.” My answer to this question is Fever Ray. My now ex-girlfriend was a huge fan of The Knife (Karin Dreijer’s first band/music project) and while liked some of their songs I found lot of it difficult to listen to, couldn’t put my finger on why but I did. But I really struggled Fever Ray’s self titled debut album (2009) to point of almost hating it. However, during this early stage of our relationship we had an arrangement where one partner could pick something to do that maybe the other didn’t want to do the rule being they had to pay for it. So we ended going to see Fever Ray in Manchester at the Academy 2 in July 2009. I was blown away both by the incredible show show and costumes and the power of the music as to enveloped me. I was converted to a fan then and there and while I still don’t own a copy of that album (one of few that for some reason I never get round to buying but can’t explain why) I’m a huge fan of it and dove deep into it after going to that gig.

"The Music DeskMusic reviews of albums and tunes, old and new., PreviousNextTo err is human, so goes the saying. In the case of Holly Herndon’s Proto, it’s a saying that echoes fatefully and repeatedly in your head as it plays. It’s a record on which its big conceit is more interesting on paper than it is to hear. With co-producer Mat Dryhurst, she has conceived an “AI baby” called Spawn, which already sounds like something out of science fiction, tasked with being made to learn and simulate sounds, specifically human ones, as you can make out on both the “live training” tracks Canaan and Evening Shades, the harmonies of the ensemble choir Herndon has convened copied in the same approximate way toddlers do when they mimic adult speech: on the latter, the result is slurred and stymied by stuttering gaps; the former, draped in reverb and sung a capella, beautifully approaches Gregorian chant.It’s a bold gambit, although sometimes you feel it was a lot more fun to record than it is to experience yourself. Herndon might not have been able to get away with such high-concept indulgences were it not for her acclaimed previous work. More indiscriminate persons will disagree, but her second album Platform was something of a breakthrough. For a time at least, it felt, however modestly, like she’d achieved a kind of celebrity with it, albeit the kind of celebrity only endowed to electronic musicians who write their songs using coding software and obscure their faces on album covers: widely raved about upon release, its success made her a front-page fixture on a number of outsider music magazines. If nothing else, Platform was remarkably prescient.Defined by a range of styles – fractured takes on choral, snatches of brutalist garage, a panoply of samples, Chicago house synth basslines, bassy mutant R&B – not unlike her contemporaries Arca or Laurel Halo, Platform’s extraordinarily odd yet inexpressibly human noise anticipated recent trends in pop music, like Sophie‘s abrasive, distorted riot. Before the ASMR craze really took off, when it was still just weird internet trivia, album track Lonely at the Top deliberately conspired to trigger its coveted ultra-sensitive “tingling” sensation. Fast-forward to now and everyone’s at it, from Cardi B whispering, purring and generally doing her signature funny noises into a foam-tipped microphone to Gen Z icon Billie Eilish, hailed for bringing the medium into mainstream pop on her debut album, full of hushed vocals recorded so close-miked, it felt uncannily as though her lips were pressed up against your ear.You didn’t need to know about granular synthesis to enjoy Platform; meanwhile, Proto inadvertently encourages you to try and work out where Spawn ends and Herndon and her cast of collaborators begins, as on the fascinating Godmother, made with footwork producer Jlin. It jabbers and clatters away, a thrilling example of what Proto does best. By contrast, Crawler is simultaneously baffling, absorbing and underwhelming, literally crawling from one style to the next: from heaving, ghostly ambience, to robo-voiced abstractions underpinned by mutant growls and found sounds, to mournful choral, all juxtaposed alongside each other but rarely meshing together.Far too often, Proto does the thing knowingly avant-garde electronic albums have a habit of doing – more a batch of earnest, scientific experiments than a series of tracks. You catch yourself bellyaching in the manner of unsympathetic people with a prejudice against avant-garde electronica, occasionally contemplating how nice it would be if some of the songs came with hooks. It’s not an unreasonable demand – she can do terrific hooks when she feels like it.Last Gasp is hypnotic and enveloping, whilst Alienation’s collision of distorted synths and Auto-Tune wailing works well. Eternal rattles like a clubby EDM-pop smash-hit, heavy on the booming electronic drums, dubstep bass and orchestral stabs you used to find on early techno records and cheap sampler keyboards, eerily synthetic voices carving out an unusually compelling melody you can imagine Future or Young Thug essaying. SWIM is absolutely fantastic, a stately, near-gothic electronic pop ballad – like a 21st century rendering of Dead Can Dance’s neoclassical 80s stuff – the best and most arresting thing here.But moments like those are infrequent. You’re reminded that the back catalogue of likeminded mad professor Richard D James contains an embarrassment of wickedly catchy and affecting melodies. The queasy music behind Extreme Love is infinitely more interesting than the tiresome spoken-word atop it – big on talk about microbes and posthuman possibilities – narrated, dishearteningly, by a child. It’s hard to deter the feeling that Frontier’s opening of unsettling, childlike massed vocals is the kind of thing you hear when you’ve just been inducted into a weird cult; if that description is enough to make you avoid it at all costs, you’d be missing out on the addictive, thudding passage that arrives after all that helium-voiced choir stuff is over, one of a few points on Proto where the music actively grabs you by the collar rather than metaphorically talking at you about microbes and posthuman possibilities in the manner of a stiff university lecturer: the silvery, warbling voice corrupted by digital effects and echoing tremolo on Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt brilliantly conveys all three in an appealingly crestfallen and human way.The problem is that the novelty of the AI-assisted music falls flat, the ambition of the enterprise not quite matching the quality of some of the tracks. On albums like these, its makers often set out to make an astute point about human nature and identity, however, all that Proto manages to convey is how imprecise it sounds when a machine imitates the human voice. You don’t doubt the sincerity or intent here – in interviews, Herndon comes off in possession of a shrewd, perceptive and inquisitive mind, given to thoughtful statements about technology’s uncertain impact on not just our lives, but music, too – but Proto occasionally smacks of an aren’t-I-clever? kind of posturing.AdvertisementsTwitterFacebookLikeLoading..., , , , PreviousSchoolboy Q: CrasH Talk review – self-reflective rapper unloads the stress without any strainNextClinic: Wheeltappers and Shunters review – sinister psych stalwarts digging into the darkness of Britain’s pastthemusicdeskblog

"Powered byOrbital deliver two mixes to celebrate their first time at Movement FestivalDetroit is the home of techno, there isn't really any dispute over that. It's the Motor City that birthed one of the most popular genres in dance music and it's showing no signs of releasing its grasp around the world.It's fitting then, that Movement Electronic Music Festival in Detroit is one of the best techno festivals on the planet and for decades its been a hotspot for worldwide ravers to flock to in their thousands to experience the best electronic music around.Taking place between May 25-27 at Hart Plaza, this year's line-up includes mainstays like Carl Craig, DJ Bone and Richie Hawtin, alongside newer techno icons Amelie Lens, Charlotte de Witte and of course, man of the moment, Virgil Abloh.As always, there are plenty of pioneers gracing the schedule but there's one prolific act making their debut this year and they need little introduction. Rave heroes Orbital will head to the festival for the first time but the live show specialists are no stranger to the main stage.For nearly 30 years, brothers Phil and Paul Hartnoll have been enchanting and captivating audiences and to pin-point exactly what sound they are would be pretty difficult considering the evolution we've seen them go through since the early 90's.Seminal anthems like 'Chime', 'Halcyon On and On' and 'Belfast' have acted as the soundtrack for a generation and newer material like their 2018 album 'Monsters Exist' are intertwined in their live shows to create something truly unique, every time they play.To put it simply, no stone has been left unturned during their illustrious career and an appearance at Movement typifies their everlasting relevance in dance music. To celebrate their performance, the duo have recorded not one, but two In Session mixes that showcase the different sounds and styles that they regularly experiment with. One mix is pretty rare from Orbital, two, well now we're just being spoiled.We caught up with the pair to hear their thoughts behind the mixes.""Recently we’ve found ourselves making mixes for various radio stations etc but also we’re getting into the swing for our ""IDOL' Residency at Eden Ibiza this Summer Season. We are very excited to be part of the well respected Movement Detroit this year and thought it would be fun to put together a couple of one hour mixes preceding the festival.We took a look at who was on the line up this year and decided, with such top producers/DJs/Bands, it would be a nice idea to pick tracks from some of those artists that will be playing this year.We felt that two mixes were in order:The first mix, around 123 BPM, has a relaxed vibe featuring some of our favourite producers like Chris Lake, Dubfire, Seth Troxler, Fisher, Soul Clap. It's good for getting ready and putting on your party clothes/make up. It's very much a 'Let’s Go' mix.The second mix around 128 BPM and has the “we are out” and ""getting down” vibe with more of a tech house flavour, again featuring some of our favourite producers. We couldn’t resist putting in our ole friend Josh Wink in there.Orbital have played live in Detroit many times over the years but that has always been our own shows. It's going to be very different this year being part of Movement Detroit which we are really looking forward to performing at.We are getting into Detroit a few days early and leaving after the festival has finished, so our plans are to actually spend time there and to enjoy all the great artists who are performing.Our time spent in Detroit this time is going to be much better than the ""tour bus-in and out gig” that we're used to.Hello Detroit we heard you had something to do with techno :-)""Tracklists can be found on SoundCloudMovement Festival takes place between May 25-27, more information hereFunster is Mixmag's Global Brand & Content Editor, he still cries every time he hears 'Belfast', follow him on Twitter",articles7,"['Richie Hawtin', 'Amelie Lens', 'Virgil Abloh', 'Phil', 'Paul Hartnoll', ""90's""]"
"Powered byFor the past seven years, the hardware-obsessed, cannabis-loving Berlin group FJAAK has excelled in crafting a hard-hitting techno sound for Modeselektor's 50Weapons and Monkeytown Records imprints that has stunned dancefloor far and wide.At the start of 2019, the prominent techno boyband went from trio to duo when Kevin Kozick decided to leave FJAAK in order to start a new project. Despite the split, it hasn't stopped the now duo - made up of Felix Wagner and Aaron Röbig - from continuing their pursuit of creating furious dancefloor tunes and performing explosive jams at both clubs and festivals all over the world.Before jumping across the pond to perform at Teksupport's inaugural GATHER Outdoors Festival, the duo has picked out 10 riotous and amazing tracks that tell the story of FJAAK's past, present and future.GATHER Outdoors Festival will take place over Memorial Day Weekend on May 25 - 26 at a resort on Holiday Mountain in the Catskills - a serene and densely forested location that is less than 90 miles from Downtown Manhattan. The line-up includes top electronic talent such as Amelie Lens, Audiofly, MK, Moscoman, Stacey Pullen, Danny Tenaglia, Doc Martin, Floorplan, Jamie XX, Maya Jane Coles, DJ Nobu, Paco Osuna, Goldcap and LCD Soundsystem’s James Murphy and more.Purchase tickets by going here.Check out FJAAK's intuitive selects ahead of the event and read what they have to say about each of the tracks below.""There have always been a lot of people that we've looked up to when we first started making music. Kris is one of those guys. He was always a very nice guy to us and when we first started talking to him about music, it gave us a lot of power.""""When we started to make music we had a lot of people we looked up to And it's still the same. Kris was always a very nice guy to us and talking with him about music like five years ago gave us a lot of power.""""It doesn't matter who you are and what skill you've got, people and skill control music but in the end, it's all created by coincidences. This track is straightforward but effective. The synth, which starts in the first second of this song, has a deep and complex mood. This track can be used as a nice opening track as well.""""This song has a fucking nice vibe! Aubrey uses some dope synth stabs in this song. The way they come, go and get replaced by groovy percussions is so dope and never gets boring. Since we mix pretty fast, we usually try to mix this song in with its very beginning. A perfect tune for an afternoon in a small sweaty club.""Pudel Club, Hamburg, 24.01.2016 - It's a Sunday and the label 50Weapons is about to shut down forever.""The sound system at the club was pretty shitty, but the vibe was on point. ""Was"" is the correct term to use here since the place burned down a few days after the party. Modeselektor closed the night, and this was the very last song Szary (of Modeselekor) played. In that moment, it got our 150 per cent of the crowd's attention. Although the club's system was not that strong, this song gets its power from the mid frequencies. The synth line is mighty as hell. We loved it, and the people loved it, Szary loved it. REWIND!!!""""After this night, we started to play this track over and over again in every venue, and we decided to transfer some files to our samplers so we could remix the song. One day, Felix came up with the idea to ask Robert Hood and Claude Young about releasing the remix. After we met Claude in San Francisco and Robert at Awakenings, we finally made it happen!""""Deapmash is a great guy and pretty young for the age you would expect when listening to his tracks. Halcyon starts with an epic, wide and warm pad before it slowly builds up and some rhythms get added. Suddenly, a digital rewind sound FX comes in and a fat kick and snare hit gets your ass without warning. Powerful song, powerful guy. Check him out.""""Richard Melville Hall (aka Moby) is a New York-born producer. His name comes from the book Moby Dick. He is one of the most important dance music figures of the early 1990s. Some of you might recognize the vocal sample in the beginning. It’s from The Davis Sisters and the song is called 'Lord Don't Leave Me'. When listening to this song back in the day, we got the idea to sample the Davis Sisters as well. We were making a lot of trip-hop and breakbeat stuff around that time and we ended up creating the track directly below this one.""When we finished this song, we didn’t know what it really was so we showed it to our homies and they told us it’s a banger. After a few weeks, we decided to start our own label with this track. Back then we did everything on our own. Events, bookings, travel, contracts etc. We enjoyed it and got to learn this part of this business as well. We had just finished up this record and it landed in our studio to get a stamp. They were all hand stamped and ready to get shipped out when something unexpected happened... Modeselektor wrote us an e-mail asking to meet us completely out of nowhere.""""We responded and all sat on a couch in our smoke-filled studio when 30 minutes later, Gernot (of Modeselektor) was at our door. The fresh stamped record got Gernot's attention pretty fast and we started to show him more of our music.""""With a FJAAK stamp on the backside of the record and a clean side on the other, he told us not to start our own imprint and asked that we put the record out on 50Weapons instead. The next day, the records got picked up and transported to the Monkeytown HQ to get a sexy 50Weapons stamp on the backside.""""Who doesn’t like KiNK? Nobody, that's who! Whether it’s his music or his character. Such a lovely man!""""This song got released around 2012 while we were still pretty new behind the decks. This was one of our favorite songs to play out and we never forget about it! The track is inspired by a train ride KiNK had. He was probably coming from a rave or something. When you listen closely, you can hear a lot of sounds which are created by a train cruising on the tracks.""""This song is from 1996. Felix and Aaron were about five years old when this record got released. It's legendary. When the synth comes in, a real raver has to reply with a loud ""WOOOOOOOOO"". While listening to this song on Youtube, we found some nice comments we’d like to share with you.""- ""Cutting my teeth on raves in the '90's brought me here﻿.""
- ""Driving around in my work van and screaming at people just feels normal while listening to this.""
- ""These yokes are mad chewy.﻿""
- ""3 am working my way through the sweaty crowd feeling pure ecstasy as I drink a delicious bottle of water.""
""- What would the '90s be without this hymn!? Nothing""Kerri Chandler - the house legend himself. When we hugged him for the first time, we felt his human warmth immediately. Such a lovely guy!""""With this song, he showed us that music is energy and music is power. For example, driving on a rainy highway can be fucked up (and it usually is). But this song makes sure it will be a relaxed drive for at least some of those minutes on the road. Or picture a rainy open-air event where you are thinking about to go home. This song can rescue a lot and just shows how much a piece of music can influence our lives.""There is no Youtube link for the exact track we are talking about, but it will be coming soon! In the meantime, here is a remix.This track is already an underground legend and it hasn't even been released yet. When Bambounou dropped this at Berghain and for the second time during our 50Weapons closing party, it totally went off! This track truly shows us how rough lovely house can be.Some of you might know how much bad luck this record has encountered - but it is almost over. Just wait a little more time and you can get this track anywhere!The Montreal festival pulls out all the stops for its fifth anniversaryGet the lowdown on how to tackle one of the world's best festivalsThe Montreal festival pulls out all the stops for its fifth anniversaryGet the lowdown on how to tackle one of the world's best festivals",articles7,"['FJAAK', 'FJAAK', 'FJAAK', 'Amelie Lens', 'Audiofly', 'Floorplan', 'Jamie XX', 'Maya Jane Coles', 'DJ Nobu', 'Paco Osuna', 'James Murphy', 'FJAAK', 'Kris', 'Kris', 'Robert Hood', 'Suddenly', 'Moby)', 'The Davis Sisters', 'Davis Sisters', 'Gernot', 'Gernot', 'FJAAK', '!

"Powered byTri Angle artist LOFT is creating her own distinct style through exploratory productions and setsAs a DJ, Aya Sinclair, aka LOFT, has a knack for theatrical, technically adventurous sets that explore woozy club, breaks and bootlegged material from her Mancunian clubland cohorts, a smattering of saccharine pop edits, and a relentless stampede of drums.In her productions she takes this free-wheeling vision to the next level, best demonstrated through her various outings on the likes of Astral Plane and Wisdom Teeth, her sweeter-than-sweet 2018 mixtape ‘ell oh eff tea too oh won ate’, and her forthcoming Tri Angle Records EP ‘and departt from mono games’.Musically, it’s easy to draw parallels between LOFT and her favoured artists, who include the likes of Björk (who is a fan in return, featuring LOFT’s track ‘Funemployed’ in her December 2018 Mixmag cover mix). “All of my favourite artists have some sense of a narrative or a consistent identity that runs through everything that they do,” says LOFT. “I’m kind of obsessed with noticing the ways in which the identity in itself is bigger than the style of music they make.”On the eve of her new EP release, LOFT is turning in a dynamic Impact mix complete with tracks from friends, family and obscure industry names alike. From Anz and Patrick Flint via Limewax, Chants, Air Max ‘97 and more, listen to the mix and read a Q+A with LOFT below.So, you’re based in Manchester. It seems like even though people focus on cities like London, Manchester's got a really authentic, dedicated underground community.We definitely have a very strong and vibrant community; perhaps it’s because the scene isn't huge, which means there are just enough people coming through that there’s a really nice variety of new stuff happening all the time. But conversely because it's not massive, everyone is able to have an idea of what everyone else does. So, when someone new comes through, they get linked with the right people pretty quickly. People are always looking out for each other here, supporting each other’s events and stuff like that. I’ve definitely felt more welcome and supported here than anywhere else I’ve lived.Say it's a reader's first time clubbing in Manchester. Where would you take them?I would ideally take them to a Mutualism night, a party run by a bunch of really close friends of mine. They’ve just had 2K with aamin, Zaleel and the absolute babe Clemency. But also, they've had people like Mun Sing, rkss, Hesska. Not to forget Scope Plus, the interdisciplinary arts festival they organised in 2017 where I played alongside artists like Visionist, Giuseppe Ielasi and BFTT. Mutualism is a collection of the people closest to my heart and I really admire all of the hard work that goes into their running events, I would totally be involved if I wasn't doing all this other stuff!Asides from them, I’d recommend a Strange Riddims event, a nine-person onslaught of the most gully silliness. Picture the scene: Dizzee Rascal’s ‘Trapped’ instrumental into the 2008 UEFA theme ‘Samba De Janeiro’ into a hardstyle edit of Bobby Caldwell’s ‘What You Won’t Do For Love’. The most delightful chaos! Either that or, of course, a boygirl night when the planets align for the next one.For readers who aren't aware of what you do with boygirl, can you tell us a bit more about it?Sure! boygirl is a queer-dominated DJ collective. We want to be clear that in choosing that terminology we are defining our collective in terms of inclusivity, and that entrance into our spaces – be that in playing with us, aligning yourself with us or, most importantly, coming to our parties – isn’t contingent on some stale notion of performative queerness! boygirl is not a space exclusively for queer people but rather a space where queerness is brought to the forefront to challenge hand-me-down perspectives on queer culture.It's a space where we can slam together the aggy macho music like grime and bassline we grew up on into some of the softer, sexier or queer-empowering tracks we’ve discovered along the way. All without having to worry about getting sparked out for presenting ourselves as we wish! At the moment, the collective is Iceboy Violet, MICHAELBRAILEY, Leo, salt pillar and me. We've had people come and go, and we're open to membership being fluid as and when people feel they can. We really want to get a more regular party off the ground in the future. Look out for an exchange we're planning later this year with a crew called MP3 [More Pussy 3mpire] based down in London.How did you get into production or even just DJing? Did you discover them at the same time?At different times. I've been playing instruments since before I remember. I started out playing drums when I was about six years old, and then started playing guitar and piano a couple years later. My dad was a very early adopter of tech, we had internet in our house in like, 1998. He was getting cracked bits of software off his mates, swapping burned CDs around. The first piece of production software I came into contact with was Sony Acid - version 3.0, I think? I just used to drag in loops and pile up as many channels of drums as possible. I didn't really start taking it seriously until I was about 13 years old or so. There was a cracked copy of Ableton Live 2.0 that my dad had found somewhere, and he was like, ‘This seems pretty interesting, maybe you want to check this out’. I started messing about with Live then and haven't looked back since.As far as DJing’s concerned I’d say I started when I was in college. The line blurs because I see the beginning of me actually DJing as when I started DJing vinyl. Before that I was doing something that was some kinda strange synthesis of live and DJ sets with a MacBook and Launchpad – and not being allowed near any soundsystems. It all really came together when I learned to beatmatch. I learned through a friend at college who had the best dubstep collection I think I’ve ever encountered, all the early Tempa releases, loads of Chestplate, loads of early Deep Medi, literally every DMZ record – he even had DMZ007! Biggest shout out to Pada!What kind of process did you go through to develop the music you wanted to make and the sound you wanted to put out?I definitely learned through a process of imitation and recombination. There’s a load of old self-released records floating around the web under different aliases which a couple of people have found. On those earlier EPs, it's like ‘an imitation of a tech house tune’ or ‘here's an attempt at a slowfast d‘n’b track’. It was about learning all of those sound worlds, all the tropes, so that when I had an understanding of the forms and sound palettes of different genres, I would have the ability to repurpose and reform them as I wished. It was a very similar process to learning to play drums. I learned to drum through listening to break-oriented records: James Brown, Roni Size, Portishead and so on. So then when I was playing in post-rock or metalcore bands later on, I kind of had the chops when we wanted to do something a little outside the standard form.It's interesting though you started out with drums, because now, they form quite a big part of your electronic music repertoire. As a kid, I'm sure you didn't think you'd be using them how you do today.I think up until I started DJing vinyl, I was dead set on becoming a touring professional drummer. Maybe there was a moment where I thought ‘hang about a second’ and did a bit of maths, and realised maybe, just maybe, this solo career thing is probably a better idea! Nah I jest, it wasn't that cynical! It was more about having a bit more control over the way I present myself and my work.Visuals, identity and creating an overarching world seems to play a big role in your wider creative process. Would you say that’s the case?All of my favourite artists have some sense of a narrative or a consistent identity that runs through everything that they do. I’m kind of obsessed with noticing the ways in which the identity in itself is bigger than the style of music they make, but how there’s then a self-similarity of their identity imprinted on each detail of their work. Take someone like Björk for example, she's done such a wide range of things but the meticulous self-curation of her image is so consistent and the way that she sounds is so consistent, despite how varied the aesthetics are record to record. This is very, very important to me. I want my work to be understood as part of a continuous narrative, for an audience to able to hear one of my pieces of music and it be both immediately recognisable as part of a wider identity that is ‘LOFT’, but also to stand alone and speak for itself.How did you get you get involved with Astral Plane Recordings?I became really good friends with Acre when I was around 19. We met at one of his shows and pretty much immediately started sending tunes back and forth over email. After a while, he invited me to guest on his Radar Radio show. I'd never done a proper radio slot before and I was so nervous. To make things worse, we'd been to Corsica the night before and I was super, super hanging. As such, I clanged pretty much every single mix. Gabe, who runs APR, was listening in on the off-chance. He really enjoyed the variety of my selections despite my messy blends so got in touch after for a mix for the label’s mix series. We had really great correspondence from the get-go. Gabe is one of my closest friends and definitely among my favourite people to work with. He has a very nuanced sensibility about his work and the scene he’s a part of. It's like what I was saying earlier about knowing all of the individual pieces, so you can construct your own microcosm. I feels like he's doing that too, I suppose it's why we work together so well.How does it feel to be pegged as a 'rising star' or 'one-to-watch?' Is there a lot of pressure that comes with that?It's been a long ride even to what feels like the starting block. I've been writing music for as long as I can remember and writing electronic music for over 10 years. Even so, the whole 'rising star' thing is nice, it's like a sense of arrival. I don't feel too much pressure about it. I've taken a lot of time to take as much pressure off myself as possible. I don’t hammer in writing tunes every day. I've tried to do that, and it just doesn't work for me. I have to work when the time's right, and when I can make measured decisions about the work I’m making.We can’t do an interview and not discuss your brand-new Tri Angle EP! How did that come about, did you have the project before you started working with the label, or vice versa?Well, this record was half finished. The way the record works is that every single track has been finished, exported as stems, and then brought back in, and then finished again, exported as stems and so on. That way, you get these layers and layers and layers of tweaks over the top of each other. I guess I'd finished maybe a second pass of it and been approached by a couple different labels. There was a bit of a kerfuffle with another label, and long story short, I did a really immature thing and mouthed off about it on Twitter.Around the same time, I’d been speaking to Robin from Tri Angle about working together. He saw my little Twitter rant and reached out like ‘Do you need a hand?’. He called me up, we spoke for a long while and he was just super calming and really helpful. I just wanted the record behind me and out in the world. I was so tempted to just share it on Bandcamp as a free download, but he told me, ‘Look this is a great record, hang onto this.' It was exactly the little bolt of confidence that I needed because I really wasn't in a good place. In the end, the process of getting this out has been pretty long but the timing of each event was kind of perfect.Can you tell me a little about the ‘crisis of identity’ you were referring to when discussing the album’s creation in the press release?This record has been written across a very tumultuous time. I was going from working 40+ hours a week in a bar and dealing with a functional drinking problem as I see a lot of creative people working in bars do, being in quite an intense relationship that was falling apart and having a very brittle understanding of myself. I went into work one day and I'd handed in my notice, broken up with my partner and shaved my head. One of my colleagues was like, 'Are you having a 2007 Britney moment?’. I started hormone replacement therapy about three months after that. I believe this is what is referred to as a “big mood”. From that crisis moment, I decided I was done with catering and hospitality. I’ve been very fortunate to be able to hold onto that.It's no wonder you wanted to get it out if you had all of this going on while you were making it.I was definitely cycling through, ‘This is great work, I'm really proud of this’ and ‘Fuck this, I hate this, I can’t bare to listen to it again’. I think that’s fairly common among musicians anyway, but I think that cycle hit me especially hard this time because the record is so rooted in processing all of the changes in my understanding of myself. I'm in a really comfortable place with myself now, but I’d say we can quite clearly hear in this record that I wasn’t having the best time a couple months ago you know?And finally, talk us through your Impact Mix.I just wanted to share some music from people who are really close to me, but then also you know, Limewax and NHØP?! I’ve built up a platform by now and I want to use that to help the people around me that are making incredible work.LOFT’s ‘and departt from mono games’ EP lands on Tri Angle Records on May 3.Jasmine Kent-Smith is Mixmag's Staff Writer.

"Returning with his self-proclaimed “grungiest and dirtiest” song yet on Tchami‘s CONFESSION, Habstrakt releases “Control.” It further proves that Habstrakt knows what it takes to annihilate a dance floor. The fluttering synths, pulsing bass lines, and fearless sub bass are set to rattle any sound system.Habstrakt establishes his control with the first bar of the track. It opens with a siren and congo drums. While this intro is subtle, don’t let it distract you from what Habstrakt has forthcoming. “Control” swiftly builds into a grungy bass house piece with sweating bass, wide synths, and a gritty percussion loop. “[This song is] inspired by the smell of burnt cars and tear gas; and by the sound of drum and bass, and UK house,” says Habstrakt. “[It’s] like a middle finger to anything predictable and repetitive.” Additionally, he states that “Control” came after a frustrating period of writer’s block.To date, Habstrakt has had his sound permeate remixes for Skrillex, Diplo, MUST DIE!, Feed Me, and many more. His sound continues to play with a number of various genres, including house, future bass, and dubstep.

Jeremih’s smooth vocals bring the single to a heightened level of passion, and together the combination is nothing short of genius.“I had been sitting on this track with Jeremih for a while now and explored every possible version of the song before landing on this one.

"Shortly after Nitti Gritti‘s collaboration with Gammer on “Underdogs” he has returned back home to Diplo‘s Mad Decent label for a release with TYNAN called “Holy Chit.” It really makes you say that, too.“Holy Chit” isn’t quite dubstep. It’s almost trap. And it straddles a fine line for drumstep. As you’ll hear throughout the track, “Holy Chit” leverages a number of the aforementioned genre elements. The producers open the track with a devious orchestra sound in 12/8 time signature that lays a solid groundwork for what’s to come. The first drop dives into a dubstep groove, while the second drop slides into drumstep so smoothly. Nitti Gritti and TYNAN bring back the orchestral section after the second drop.

"With a name as off the cuff as their sound, um.. debuts their brand new three-track collection via Zeds Dead’s Deadbeats imprint.The California duo kicks things off with their experimental sound design and minimal production techniques, and the name of the single says it all–”what?” Stoner-worthy quotes lead you in, alluding to the fact that branding is not the pair’s focus, setting them apart from a majority of their industry counterparts. Vocal resampling, dubstep-influenced growls and practical basslines bring this track to a bittersweet ending.Keeping branding to a minimum, “okay” takes things up a notch with a mystifying introduction before exploding into heavier territory. Showing a disregard towards typical EDM song structure, “-lil jon” follows a similar pattern of unexpected twists and turns, making this one a personal favorite.

"QUIX proves he’s a generous man with his release of the official remix package for his most recent hit “Stronger” featuring Elanese.The original track, released in January of this year, was an empowering future bass anthem that showcased QUIX’s knack for creating striking melodic bass music. Then, the New Zealand native decided to offer up a challenge via popular electronic music sample pack and community site Splice. He featured the track in one of Splice’s famous remix contests, and through that discovered three promising up-and-comers, Synchron, Skrybe, and Mod3no. Though Synchron was the official Grand Prize winner (which included his own Dim Mak release and a future collab with QUIX – we’ll be on the lookout for those), QUIX also grabbed the two runners-up to be featured on the official remix package, along with dubstep heavy-hitters Tisoki and TYNAN.Tisoki and TYNAN lead out the EP with their own reimaginings, featuring their insane sound design skills and filthy bass stylings. Synchron gives us a refined future bass drop that stands on its own and proves he’s a producer to watch. Skrybe offers up an epic and emotional rendition, while Mod3no switches things up with a drum and bass version of the track.

"Fresh-faced producers BINKS and GNOSIS team up for a powerful collaborative EP, Transcendence, on Atlanta trap legend MAYHEM’s SKRONG imprint.LA native BINKS and fellow freeform bass connoisseur GNOSIS put their heads together for a five-track journey through time, space and sound. The project as a whole offers a palpable sense of emotion, stemming from a deep-rooted transformation for BINKS, who courageously looked his demons in the eye to vault himself to a place of clarity, success, and sobriety.Each single throughout Transcendence offers something unique to the story. “Astral Projection” sets the stage with gritty halftime vibes, making use of organic sounds and distorted neuro basslines. “Symbiot” offers otherworldy experimental trap drips and drops that harken back to BINKS’ struggle with addiction, before cinematic creation “Calcination” creeps up your spine with unignorable energy levels. Title track “Transcendence” offers subtle hip-hop samples, sliding 808s, and UZ-worthy trap swagger. Lastly, “Defcon” brings things full circle with nasty UK-inspired themes and compelling percussive elements.“‘Transcendence’ embodies the depth of limitless potential that lies within the human consciousness. Go beyond psychological constructs & rise above to your true potential.”  – BINKS“‘Transcendence’ is an alchemy of vibrations & intention. This project is a fusion of organic & synthetic soundscapes, dancing in tension and release, bringing order to chaos. It is the process of an old paradigm of bass music transcending into the new.” – GNOSISIt’s clear these two stunners are on the brink of something big, and it will be undeniably exciting to watch it unfold.

"FMB MIXTAPE 117 | PRIVATE PRESSFMB MIXTAPE 117 | PRIVATE PRESS (iTUNES)FMB MIXTAPE 117 | PRIVATE PRESS (320 DOWNLOAD)Episode 117 of our mixtape series comes from Private Press; the project from Warsaw duo Adam Brocki and Jan Wóycicki. First up, we asked a bit about the mix and what they’ve been up to lately…We’ve been mostly spending time in our studio, working on our first Boiler Room session and finishing upcoming Rekids stuff. We also found some time for new productions, jams and our other collaborative projects and solo stuff. Tried to dig for a little bit more music, so we had some “quality time” with discogs and web browser as well.The mix was recorded in our studio. We used 2 CDJs and XONE mixer, recorded two mixes and then cut them and put them together. We also add 2 tracks in ableton. At the end we used some EQ’s and add some special juice. We thought we’d bring some tracks that we were recently playing and longtime favourites. Not any special ideas!Up next… Studio work as always, few gigs around Europe. Already mentioned Rekids EP will be out on May 17. Later there’s gonna be the third EP for Indigo Aera and also the second EP on our label Ziemia with Bartosz Kruczyński/Earth Trax.

"If you watched Gorgon City‘s dominating daytime set at Coachella last month either on site or via livestream, then you already know about their collab with Kaskade and Roméo on a track entitled, ‘Go Slow.’If you weren’t privy to either, then this is probably a pleasant surprise. At least I think it’s pleasant.Ryan Raddon has a way of integrating himself into another artist’s or group’s sounds without compromising the integrity. As a result, in his collaborations, you can always hear something distinctly original that also bears his fingerprints.In this case, there’s a bed of slowly undulating soft synths that the rest of the song is built on and neither part detracts from each other.I work, live and play in Minneapolis.I try to tell the story of the people that create music and experiences through pictures as well as through words.",articles25,"['Gorgon City‘s', 'Roméo', 'Ryan Raddon']"
"Changes abound for the 2019 iteration of Electric Forest. Brace yourself, because at least one of these will probably bum you out. That doesn’t mean this is going to be a lesser experience by any means, just that you may want to find a way to process and accept changes by the time you get there.Change, after all, is how Electric Forest grew from its humble beginnings in the ashes of Rothbury Festival and slowly developed into the incredible and expansive experience it is today. Change brought the Observatory, the Psychedelic Chapel, the Grand Artique, and much of the artwork set up throughout Sherwood Forest. Change also improved the hell out of the stage production and added Jubilee, the Hangar, and the Carousel Club.Now that we’ve built up change to help you feel pretty good about it, let’s rip off the band-aid for the 2019 changes, shall we?Just kidding, they aren’t dead, but they are not going to be included in the vendors this year. No word on why, but I have a certain group of less than pleased feelings in reaction to this. At a festival, Spicy Pie is life. BUT, this will be an important means of learning how to cope and to diversify our options for sustenance.That’s right, folks, no late-night inappropriate and sexy clowns for us courtesy of Mama Fou and the rest of Fou Fou Ha. Let’s all raise a carrot and exert one, big collective sigh of sadness…there, that wasn’t so bad, now was it? Sure it was, but that’s over now, and we can move on. Begrudgingly forward we go.Now that the nasty stuff is out of the way, let’s hit up a few things to look forward to this year. We’re going to cover music in a separate post, but since Electric Forest is so much more than a music festival, I thought to dedicate this preview to everything but.So, without further ado, but with a cliche, here are our recommendations for Electric Forest 2019:One thing that The Great De-Fouing opens up is more opportunities in the Psychedelic Chapel space, which HQ has opted to distribute directly to the Forest Fam, rather than moving on to a new performance troupe. Enter ‘Chapel Parties for the People,’ the Plug-In Program that invited attendees to design their own parties and uses for the space. A total of eight parties will be selected and put in touch with the EF’s production crew who will help bring their vision to life. The submission period is over, so we’ll have to wait and see what’s in store for the Chapel this year. I appreciate the crowd-sourcing solution to this Fouvoid.This is one option where applications are still being accepted. Did you find your boo in the Forest? Did you spend hours roaming around together, uncovering some of the many secrets in Sherwood? If Electric Forest is where it started or what brought the two of you together, then the powers that be want to hear about it. Selected entrants will be honored en masse in a special ceremony.What do you suppose that looks like? It’s probably not an orgy, right? It’s intriguing for sure. Again, we’ll have to wait to see what unfolds. I also can’t help but wonder if they should also have some kind of Solo Forester celebration for people who attend by themselves. Those are some brave souls that deserve attention, too. Maybe that’ll happen at EF 2020?This may seem a little silly on the surface. Scribble a note to somebody you can’t talk to on a paper bag and throw a fake candle inside and that’s, what, a fitting tribute for a loved one? Short answer: You’re goddamn right it is.It’s okay to feel silly when you’re doing it, but once you’ve got it set up on the wall with the rest of the luminarias, you’ll better understand that your contribution represents somebody with a huge impact on you, who you miss with all of your being, and you will realize how many of your fellow Forest Fam share that kind of huge presence and tragic loss in their lives. And you’ll probably cry when you realize this, and that’s okay, too.Sometimes the best agenda is no agenda. Carve out some time where your only plan is to wander the Forest and see what you can find. Many of my most cherished Forest memories came about as the result of wiping away plans for an afternoon. We’ve posted up at the Observatory and people-watched, we’ve interacted with the wandering trash trolls or Yellow Suit Society, we’ve set up little terrariums throughout the Forest, “collected” fairy door pics, and so on.Inside the walls of the Grand Artique, you’ll find a plethora of goods to drool over, from pins to vintage hats to bowling pins and band-aids. You can pay cash for anything in the store, but the real fun comes in the negotiation process with the people behind the counter.From what I’ve gathered over the years, the most valued currency at the Grand Artique is stories. If you have a diamond ring, that’s neat, but without a story it’s really just a ring. But if there’s a story attached to it and you can relate an engaging narrative attached to the diamond ring, its value increases exponentially.Instead of saying it is an engagement ring for a wedding that never happened, you can say you went deep sea fishing and caught some mammoth coelacanth, a fish that is supposed to be extinct but have somehow survived since the age of dinosaurs. When you opened up the ancient fish, you found a millenia’s worth of shiny trinkets and among them, the very ring that the famous Titanic survivor Rose tossed into the water. And no, it really wasn’t that big, they just made it out to be a ridiculous ring to sell tickets.That’s the value: the narrative.The Ocular Organ was always cool, but when it was stuffed into the very back of Ranch Arena, it sat wasting its potential (much like I did in high school) with a modest lighting set-up.Relocated to the Sherwood Court side of the Forest in 2018, the Organ gained a LOT of extra lighting and with the dismantling of the Observatory’s Japanese-ish towers, it also acquired seating.As a player plays, the sounds trigger light sequences, disco ball spotlights, fog machines, and lasers as the composition gets more complex or is played for longer. I think. I got so swept up when things kicked into high gear that it was hard to track which sound was triggering what lights. Imagine if Clark Griswold’s house in Christmas Vacation took a buuuunch of acid and you’d have something that sorta resembles the Ocular Organ in full spectacle mode.Add to that a series of hoopers, dancers, additional instruments coming out, and the occasional singer and you have yourself something worth writing home about. Speaking of…At the Grand Artique, you’ll find a mailbox with stacks (on stacks on stacks) of postcards. You can fill these postcards out and throw them in the mailbox. Once the festival is over, the postcards all get a stamp and then they’re put away for an undetermined amount of time. Some months later, your addressee will get a fun piece of mail from you.If you haven’t noticed, mail usually sucks. It’s either a bill or somebody trying to sell you something. Other than the occasional holiday card, it’s typically bupkis. Why not change that and provide an unexpected rush of humanity for those closest to you? Good mail is as rare as a coelacanth, but it doesn’t have to be.So, that’s it for now!

"Madeon is back with a new single, All My Friends, his first original music in 3 years and it’s a breath of fresh air that I didn’t know I needed.The track’s release serves as an introduction to the French producer’s new era, titled “Good Faith.” Madeon, aka Hugo Leclerq, set up a dedicated site for the new era, which you can keep up with at goodfaith.world.Stylistically, it’s a bit of a departure from his previous, more melodic work. “All My Friends” is also an entirely single-handed affair with Madeon taking on vocal duties in addition to production.As is the norm, the lead single release off of a new album accompanies a tour announcement. No word yet on the release date for Good Faith, but Hugo will make a pair of experiences at his bestie Porter Robinson’s Second Sky Festival before debuting his new life setup at Lollapalooza on August 3rd.I work, live and play in Minneapolis.I try to tell the story of the people that create music and experiences through pictures as well as through words.",articles25,"['Madeon', 'Madeon', 'Good Faith', 'Porter Robinson']"

"Brazil’s DJ Meme is well known for his sparkling Disco releases and shimmering  DJ sets worldwide.As he releases his brilliant cover version of Gino Soccio’s classic ‘Dancer’, we talk to the man about all things Disco past and present – he also gives us his 5 top tips for producing a disco record below.1. Disco was made with many musicians playing together at the same room,  therefore the sound of the drums was leaking all over and vice-versa,  so… don’t try to create a clean sound. A bit of dirt is required.2.  The bassline…ooooh, the bassline. Get the best bass player you may find, but be sure he knows the Disco pace, hooks and sound. A good disco record has always the right bassline.3. Because Disco was played by musicians and not machines, don’t expect to have it quantized or keeping the same tempo along the track. A little bit of imprecision will make it real.4. Forget the tracky-copy-paste kind of production. Disco music was full of songs and melodies that stuck to your mind forever. If you decide to go instrumental, at least bring some good Melodies and Harmonies to it.  There is no Disco without it.5. Disco needs no Sub-low or too high frequencies. Because of some technical issues, at that time it was almost impossible to cut vinyl with frequencies under 60hz and studio equalizers wouldn’t go far than  12K, so…have that in mind and take it, easy kids.DJ Meme ‘Dancer’ is out now on Memix Recordings. ",articles34,"['Gino Soccio', '…', 'Forget']"

"The Cause, London’s DIY dance space that has turned the tables for London clubbing since opening one year ago, has its first (and only) birthday coming up on Saturday 26th May.The day and night birthday party coined ‘XXX’ will be spread across its five areas, two outdoor and three indoor, but they are keeping the headliners completely unannounced.The Cause’s co-founder Eugene Wild commented on the reasons as to why they want to keep the rest under wraps “There’s a whole load of reasons as to why we’ve kept this under wraps. Primarily we’re 100% DIY. We do most things ourselves at the club, with a very small team. Dealing with the logistics of flights, hotels, ground transport on our birthday isn’t ideal, we’d rather be on the dancefloor with our phones off, lost in the moment of what we have built, celebrating our birthday, on our terms.“Eugene then goes on to say “Keeping headliners under wraps also gives us flexibility. We are a small independent venue and there is no way we can afford to stack the line-up as we have. There’s a lot of amazing artists playing within a 50-mile radius of our space, so we can save costs, save logistics and stack the line-up. Flights from Chicago, Romania and Germany aren’t cheap.”Having proved to the wider community that running a club that gives back is possible, The Cause has now been granted a license extension to January 2020.For more info and line-ups head to https://www.supportthecause.co.uk/",articles34,"['The Cause’s', 'Primarily']"

"Multi-instrumentalist producer, Lomea will be releasing the second single, entitled ‘Reach’ from ‘Echoes in Bloom’ via Here & Now Recordings.Lomea is the experimental electronic project of composer, artist and sound designer Richard Keyworth.Born on the outskirts of south London, he grew up with dreams of being a drummer and lived that dream out by fashioning a makeshift drum kit form whatever he could find around his home.He had classical guitar training as a young boy, from which he moved on to electric guitar. In 2009, he graduated with a first class degree in Music Production from the University of Brighton.Lomea cites a range of artists, both contemporary and legendary, who have served as inspiration over the years, from Jon Hopkins to Steve Reich. Other influences include Clark, Trentemøller, Opeth, The Field, The Cinematic Orchestra, Sigur Rós, Radiohead, Massive Attack, Jaga Jazzist. The sounds of alt-rock, trip-hop, dream-pop, techno and ambient stylings permeate and intermix.The album features ten full instrumental songs, complex compositions with enough space to breath. We premiere ‘Reach’ of the album today – something different from us, but we were blown away by cascading acoustic guitars and infectious percussion, textured synths and off-kilter hits attacking from all angles all in an electronic track – we think you’re gonna love it too!When speaking about the song, Lomea said, “This came about one afternoon almost accidentally. Originally there was going to be the tuned kick drum playing a ‘melodic’ bass line but I mis-dialled the pitch knob on the synth and it played a note I wasn’t expecting which threw the track onto a different course altogether. After that, all the big reverbed synth stuff came really naturally. There’s a lot packed into a short length with this track, one reason I’m really proud of it.”‘Reach’ is released on 24th May and ‘Echoes in Bloom‘ is out on the 31st May.",articles34,"['Echoes', 'Jon Hopkins', 'Steve Reich', 'Opeth', 'The Field', 'The Cinematic Orchestra', 'Sigur Rós', 'Radiohead', 'Jaga Jazzist', 'I’m']"

We got the main idea down on a voice memo and when we arrived home the rest of the song just fell into place. ‘I Want You’ is about someone you can’t live without, it’s a song of gratitude for where you are in life and recognition that you couldn’t make it on your own.”‘I Want You’ is out now, stream it below and follow WITHOUT on Spotify to keep up with new music.",articles34,[]

"Something new is on the horizon. A team-up whose history is inextricably entwined with the story of UK bass-heavy music itself, and who are set to write a whole new chapter.It’s time to get to know Beat Merchants.In their own right, Jubbz (aka Supply & Demand) and Juiceman are icons of jungle, drum ‘n’ bass and beyond. They’ve already racked up a lifetime’s worth of accomplishments across deejaying, production, emceeing, and more. And yet, somehow, with Beat Merchants, they’ve geared up and are ready to revolutionise once again.Perhaps it’s not surprising. After all, these guys have bass music ingrained in their respective double-helices. Jubbz was raised with music all around him, his close family including members of the foundation reggae band Matumbi. Simultaneously, the same music was guiding the taste and direction of Juiceman, leading him to become one of the most highly regarded mic men around since his emergence via the mythical Milwaukees club. As hardcore arrived and evolved through jungle and DnB, each of the Beat Merchants secured their reputation as a unique, inimitable musical voice.The Beat Merchants’ story is also intimately connected to the V Recordings family of labels. Bryan Gee and Jumpin Jack Frost’s imprints have showcased tunes like Supply & Demand’s “Jah Music” and “Delicious”, as well as Juiceman’s “Together” and his seminal remix of the Roni Size classic “It’s a Jazz Thing”. Touching on flavours of jungle and liquid, plus more category-resistant twists of style, both Jubbz and Juiceman have built an extensive discography of distinctive DnB productions.But it’s not all just about drum ‘n’ bass. Juiceman is well-known for his excursions into UKG and bass music, both as an emcee and as a producer. Output like his Zed Bias collabs and releases on seminal labels like Tempa and Rinse have firmly established him as a multi-genre force to be reckoned with. And Jubbz’s list of credits across multiple styles, from mainstream to underground, is similarly dazzling. Remix work for the likes of Leona Lewis, Amy Winehouse, and Shaggy, a “Best Global DJ” award, a straight up chart hit as one of the creators of “Bouncing Flow”…the list goes on.Jubbz and Juiceman’s shared passion and heritage stretches back to before drum ‘n’ bass, before jungle, and before hardcore. Those deep foundations, coupled with the musicality, live performance chops, and studio skills that have kept them at the top of the game all this time make Beat Merchants a very exciting prospect indeed.What happens when two versatile, genre-twisting, multi-talented artists team up? Let’s find out. Beat Merchants are here.Today we premiere their debut release ‘Whisper’ which combines Jungle/liquid vibes, dreamy vocals, melodic trumpets, a rolling bassline and funky drum work.

"With over 25 years of music under his belt, dance music veteran and Glasgow Underground owner Kevin McKay is set to embark on his next project – an innovative concept album which will reimagine a selection of classic tracks and bring them up to date for today’s dancefloors without using a single sample. The first single from the album sees him teaming up with the #1 selling house artist David Penn on gospel-house cut, ‘Hallelujah’.A cover of Randy Crawford’s 1977
track of the same name, ‘Hallelujah’ is a feel-good slice of classic 90s house,
with room-filling vocals, melodic keys and a grooving bassline that drives the
track from start to finish. Huge build-ups and hands-in-the-air breakdowns make
this one an instant party-starter. Now revamped with a fresh, futuristic feel
whilst still capturing the nostalgic elements of its era, ‘Hallelujah’ is ready for round two.  Speaking about the track, Kevin said:“From the
moment I first heard the Slam boys play the Frankie Knuckles mix of Sounds of
Blackness “The Pressure” in Glasgow’s Sub Club the marriage of gospel
and house music seemed perfect to me. Ever since then I’ve been a sucker for
tracks in that style be it cuts from the 90s like Voices of 6th Avenue
“Call Him Up” or ones from today like Sophie Lloyd’s “Calling
Out” or Floorplan’s “Tell You No Lie”.Another
producer who has recently delivered on the gospel house front is David Penn.
I’m a huge fan of his records and since his killer remix of “The Oooh
Song” we’ve been discussing a collaboration. Given our shared interest,
gospel seemed like our perfect meeting point. Here it is. Between us I think
we’ve delivered a record that sits somewhere between Kings Of Tomorrow’s
“Finally” and his own chart-topping “Nobody”.” With a brand-new album (a sneak preview of this is given in this video) in the pipeline, ‘Hallelujah’ is the perfect way to introduce this game-changer.",articles34,"['–', 'David Penn', 'Randy Crawford’s', 'Sophie Lloyd’s', 'David Penn', 'I’m']"

"The four-track EP ‘Seasick Acid’ is an aquatic addition to the Gunnar Haslam multiverse. We asked Gunnar Haslam about the story behind this EP, his third release on The Bunker NY on 21st June, confirming that he has not been recently seasick but did grow up by the ocean spending plenty of time on boats as a young man. He went on to explain “the best nights out hearing music are the rocky ones, not the smooth voyages”.‘The Kioku’ EP is Wata Igarashi’s third release on The Bunker New York also due out on 21st June. This release showcases a considerable emotional range that speaks to his long career as a sound designer.All four tracks feature a cinematic, expansive quality that makes it easy to imagine how each could fit specific moments across the arc of a party. Different aspects of the music are carefully balanced and combined: seemingly simple patterns in the foreground are animated by precise intensities at play in the background.We encourage you to give this one a listen on a proper sound system or headphones to fully dive into the intricacies of Igarashi’s sound design.",articles34,['Igarashi’s']

Daley Padley, better known as Hot Since 82, just presented a new ‘Even Deeper’ video, this time in the lands of Brazil. This is the series third installment, after presenting its first episodes in Mexico and Japan.
In recent months, the British DJ has shown his “slow touring” concept, which has allowed him to give himself more time and space to explore his tour destinations widely. The third episode was filmed between the end of February and the beginning of March 2019 under the production of Adrenorama.
“I am lucky to be in a privileged position where my work enables me to travel the world. However, after years of doing so I realized I was often visiting some of the planet’s most interesting and exotic locations but not having the chance to stop for a moment to explore and experience the culture beyond the airport, hotel and club. The Even Deeper concept allows me to do just that, spending more time touring a country and see its true beauty. It’s just incredible”, the DJ commented.
Among the scenes, viewers can find Hot Since 82 at the famous Brazilian Carnival, and at a boat ride through the depths of the Amazon jungle. Also, included are his shows at Warung, Laroc and a pop-up party at the Mirador 9 de Julio in Sao Paulo.

"In order to achieve their 2019 promise to release one single per month.
British duo The Young Punx formed by Hal Ritson and Nathan Taylor just shared their latest music offering entitled ‘Drop It Hard’ via MofoHifi Records.
Created in 2003 out of London’s vibrant underground mashup, bootleg and breakbeat scenes The Young Punx continue to celebrate and subvert the dance music form in their own world where the norms of house, jungle, hip hop and breaks are disrupted by a seemingly random sound-clash of genre mashes and pop culture incursions.
Included on their upcoming fifth studio album,‘Drop It Hard’ fuse the driving pulse of an early 80s new wave live groove break with auto-tune MC toasting. “The vibe of this track was initially inspired by the drum sound of The Police’s Stewart Copeland in the very early 80s… We worked with our longtime drummer Alex Reeves (Elbow, Razorlight) to accurately recreate this rather unique drum sound and feel, and then built a fresh track around it. But the addition of dancehall MC toasting over the solid post-disco groove was the wildcard element that made the track pop and become a beast in its own right!”, Hal commented.

"Just in time for the summer season!
Brooklyn based label Dance Artifakts is releasing today their latest EP by the hands of Alberto Jossue. The pack, which carries a peaceful, subdued vibe on its surface, hides an infinite number of layers, effects and textures beneath. Two original tunes and a remix by Aquariox comprise this dubby, melodic release with a crisp production that highlights every detail of each track.

Opening track ‘Surrendered’ is a fresh slice of cool, collected beats that herald the transformation of winter into spring, marked by a solid, steady rhythm which builds up from skeletal percussion and wispy synths into deep, dubbed-out bliss while a decidedly more direct approach is taken on ‘Rider’, a track where the rhythm takes front and center and influences every aspect of the production, from the stabbing filtered synths to the busy percussion in the background.

Closing the EP is a remix of ‘Rider’ by Aquariox, a Brooklyn DJ, producer and Dance Artifakts regular, who pushes the track even further into the stratosphere, but leaving the rhythm section very well grounded with pounding beats and rolling bassline, resulting in a production that tugs at both your feet and your mind at the same time.

Alberto Jossue’s ‘Surrender’ is now available on Dance Artifatks. Grab your copy here.

The company is exploring new spaces in South Florida.
It was recently announced that the annual Ultra Music Festival will not be held in Miami in 2020 after its city license was canceled.
Through a statement, the promoters confirmed that they are evaluating a new South Florida location “that will serve as an incredible and permanent home” for the event.
This year Ultra Music Festival moved to Virginia Key following the City of Miami vote against the show being held at Bayfront Park after 21 years. However, the decision was not beneficial for any of the parties.
In the statement, the festival organizers also expressed that after listening to the opinions of many of this year’s assistants, it was clear that the festival experience at the new venue “just was not good enough”. In addition, the Virginia Key Advisory Board voted against Ultra taking place there again in 2020 due to stressed fish and other environmental impacts in the area.

"Inspired by a love of A Certain Ratio, Talking Heads, P funk and scratchy dub, NUMBER is a new forward-thinking sound machine fronted by Ali Friend and Rich Thair – the co-founders and rhythm section of electronic music pioneers and musical renegades, Red Snapper.
The duo’s debut single ‘Face Down in Ecstasy’, released April 19th via Sunday Best Recordings, is primed with dirty-disco bass, slicing live drums, jagged guitar melodies and Ali’s urgent, catchy vocals. Written, performed and produced by Ali and Rich, the track is lyrically very much a reflection of our times, with a nod in the direction of the alt disco moments of A Certain Ratio and Talking Heads. The track is supported by a ground-breaking animated video, produced and directed by Leo Nicholson (Fantastic Mr. Fox).
“Face Down was inspired by our love of late 70’s and early 80’s dirty disco and funk, combined with the do-it -yourself art school approach of some new wave bands like A Certain Ratio, Magazine etc,” says Ali. “For us it was a fresh look at those times, but very much re-appraised through a pair of 2019 vari-focals. We enjoy the clash of old ideas with new ones; old sounds with new ones.; acoustic with electronic.”
NUMBER are Ali Friend (electric bass, guitars, gato drum, xylophone, MOOG, voice), Rich Thair (drums, percussion, drum machines, synths), Dan Carney (vocals), Dan Carney (vocals), Heloise Gerstein (vocals), Luisa Tunstall-Behrens (vocals) and John Metcalfe (strings) and Byron Wallen (trumpet).

"Early this morning, Madeon appeared on BPM, a SiriusXM radio show. He was invited to talk about his new project and the song, ‘All My Friends’ that was just released today.‘All My Friends’ definitely has a more pop flavor to it. This is addressed at the beginning of the interview. “I definitely tried to outgrow some of my previous production sensibility, which was, you know, informed by dance music.” He added, “I keep everything that I loved about that and also embrace all my other influences.” The Good Faith Era is going to see a lot more live instrumentation. AMF has live bass and some live drums. There is also going to be “practically no features” when it comes to vocals. He spoke about how he wanted to “embody the project as an artist, and not just the producer.” The interview also goes into the Shelter Era. How that song both influenced and was influenced by what he is creating now. He actually was already creating his second album before the famed collaboration with Porter Robinson ever happened. “Porter had heard some of the music I was writing and really liked it, and it kind of inspired us to make ‘Shelter’.” The rest of the interview is an interesting look into Madeon’s past. He talks very candidly about when he was kicked out of school. He really didn’t have any options except to create music. And he fluctuated from being really excited about his future to being terrified that he wasn’t going to make it. Good Faith is going to have a lot of personal songs that tell his story. This is the most authentic Madeon that we have ever been given, and this is just the beginning.",articles11,"['Madeon', 'Porter Robinson', 'Madeon’s', 'Good Faith', 'Madeon']"
"Woop! Woop! The Bloody Beetroots strikes back yet again, dropping a , hot song collab today with Dr. Fresch, ‘FKN FACE’. Imagine waking up in the morning and pouring yourself a bowl of electro-punk synth riffs, a pumping g-house bassline, and Bob Rifo screaming in your face. That’s exactly what you’ll hear in this fire drop from The Bloody Beetroots and Dr. Fresch. 2019 has been a year of two-hit banger releases thus far from The Bloody Beetroots. Recently coming off of his release with Ephwurd, “Wildchild,” Rifo continues to surprise us with “FKN FACE.” These songs will be released on the anticipated EP, ‘Heavy,’ which will be released later this year. This year also marks the 10-year anniversary of “Warp 1.9“ with Steve Aoki in 2009. Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo, otherwise known as The Bloody Beetroots, is definitely back this year with a vengeance. Being born into punk rock in the year of 1977, Italian Producer Sir Bob Cornelius Rifo never fails to impress us with his ability to infuse thrashing punk sounds into the world of electronic music. With Dr. Fresch by his side for his track, you can definitely go four-to-the-floor while headbanging with your tongue out at the same time. The song opens up with a rather groovy vocal that will automatically get your head bobbin’, followed by Rifo screaming “I can’t feel my fkn face!” Then comes that OG bassline we love from Dr. Fresch, paired with Rifo’s signature guitar riff synthesizer sounds.Dr. Fresch, better known as Tony Fresh, Los Angeles native, has continued to gain momentum over the last year. With over 30 million plays on SoundCloud and launching Prescription Records, Tony is sure to be making more moves in the forthcoming future, especially with this new collab. Both Rifo and Fresch are innovators of their sounds and are now weaving together elements of house, hip-hop, and punk rock with this song.Everyone remembers the early electro-punk days of 2009-2010, the time before there was a sea of smartphones spread across the crowds, and the masses were rockin’ out to The Bloody Beetroots and Steve Aoki. At least, that’s exactly where I was during the Spring of 2010 at the Hollywood Palladium Hard show featuring The Bloody Beetroots, Designer Drugs, Sinden, and Destructo. This new song release brings two OG’s together and we wholeheartedly can’t wait to see what more is in store for the indefinite future.

But I think I know who I’d rather be 😂Even Slushii poked fun and joined in with Jauz’s remix back in December 2018. However, is the remix some “masterpiece of the 21st century”?

"Is SoundCloud changing the game again? In addition to integrating with Virtual DJ earlier this year, it looks like DJs are in for another treat. The world’s largest open audio platform announced recently that they are launching software integration with Native Instruments’ Traktor DJ 2. Furthermore, instead of having to load your own mp3s, SoundCloud and Traktor DJ 2 users can access the massive SoundCloud digital streaming catalog. This includes over 200 million tracks, from 20 million creators.From the full press release:  Sama, Rachael, Lyzza, Tommy Four Seven, Objekt, Felix Da Housecat, Kornel KovacsAlthough this is exciting news for SoundCloud, it seems to be a competing market as other major streaming services such as Beatport are launching their own DJ streaming service with Pioneer DJ, ‘Beatport LINK’. With the beta version released earlier this month, Beatport CEO Robb McDaniels said in a statement; “The launch of Beatport LINK exhibits our commitment to creating the best possible experience for our expanding ecosystem of DJs, and we can think of no better partner than Pioneer DJ for the service’s first software integration. We are particularly excited to introduce the upcoming Offline Performance Mode, which firmly sets Beatport LINK apart from its competitors in the DJ market.” As the DJ ecosystem grows and evolves, the prehistoric tradition of lugging around vinyls sounds less and less appealing. Although, neither SoundCloud nor Beatport specifically address audio quality or kb/s streaming rates in their statements, the move to make music catalogs more accessible for DJs seems like a great, and universal move.Get started today by downloading the Traktor DJ 2 on the Native Instruments’ website or ‘Beatport LINK’ here!

"It’s really is the end of an era in digital music. According to Bloomberg almost two decades after launching iTunes and forever changing the model of physical album purchases; Apple is finally ready to retire the iconic product. During the software keynote at their annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC); Next Monday Apple is planning on replacing iTunes with standalone music, television and podcast apps.Although the move has been rumored for years now & was only confirmed back in April. This new and improved move set to unify Apple’s media strategy across their devices. The iPhones and iPads already offer separate music, TV and podcast apps, unlike the centralized iTunes app on Macs and MacBooks. As far as functionality is concerned, users can expect the new Music app to offer some of the same features that iTunes currently does. Things like purchasing songs and syncing phones would remain albeit in a much sleeker interface that’s more in tune with Apple’s current design language. It’s also expected that the new Music service will be closely bundled with their existing streaming service Apple Music.The death of iTunes will definitely be good news for disgruntled & frustrated users of the service. But iTunes will forever deserve credit for the way it revolutionized the music industry in the early 2000s. Before iTunes, the main source of music consumption was illegal file-sharing on Napster. Enter Steve Jobs’ & iTunes, a new product that would become the digital era’s first sustainable, user-friendly (and very legal) way to listen to music. ",articles11,"['WWDC', 'iPads', 'Apple’s']"

"What’s the go-to app that you find yourself spending most of your time? Facebook and Instagram are probably the top two apps that users admit to using every day. Although Facebook was created about 6 years before Instagram, new research shows that more people are spending time on Instagram. Are you one of them?According to a report from eMarketer, adults will be spending more time on Instagram this year than both Facebook and Snapchat. Unfortunately, Facebook is not expected to recover from their drop in users which became a hot topic last year. Younger adults (Teens), are reportedly more inclined to use Instagram than Facebook as well. It could simply be that younger audiences are attracted to the visual environment Instagram has created. eMarketer found that the average daily amount of time adults spent on Facebook dropped by 3 min in 2018. New estimates show that users will now spend a generous 38 minutes per day on the app, 2 minutes lower than expected. On the other hand, Instagram has increased its usage time among users, reaching 27 min per day. eMarketer suspects that Facebook’s decline is in part, due to not staying up to date with engaging content like videos and stories.If Facebook wants to stay relevant, it will need to focus on younger adults. If not, younger teens and adults will stick with other social media apps like Instagram or Twitter instead. In addition, Facebook must also work to clean up their neglected platform. From fake profiles to click-bait posts, the social media giant has plenty of room for improvement, going into the next decade. Let us know what improvements you think Facebook should implement to stay relevant.

Adrastea orbits 129,000 km from its parent planet Jupiter and it takes 0.298 Earth days for Adrastea to complete one orbit. The rotational period for Adrastea is unknown, but its orbital period is 7 hours. #GAIA #MoonsOfJupiterA post shared by  GAIA (@gaia) on GAIA offers a more experimental form of van Buuren‘s and de Goeij‘s trance, never shying away from underground sounds or from innovative harmonies.

Orbiting within Io's orbit, which is the innermost of the four largest moons of Jupiter (called the Galilean moons), are four smaller moons named Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and Thebe. Amalthea is the largest within this grouping with a mean radius of about 83.5 ± 2.4 km. Amalthea orbits 181,400 km from its parent planet, Jupiter. Amalthea takes 0.498 Earth days to complete one orbit. #GAIA #MoonsOfJupiterA post shared by  GAIA (@gaia) on When we caught up with Armin during Miami Music Week he gave us some insight on this Gaia album, but told us the tracks were not finished at the time. Could we see an EP of 4 tracks? Perhaps – but only time will tell.  Thebe is one of the four known small moons that orbit closer to Jupiter than the four vastly larger Galilean moons. These eight are the only known ""regular"" Jovian satellites, which means that they orbit Jupiter in the same direction as the planet's rotation (prograde orbits), and that their orbits are almost circular and in the same plane as Jupiter's equator. Thebe is the planet's seventh largest moon, with a mean radius of about 49 km. At a distance of about 138 thousand miles (222 thousand kilometers) from Jupiter, Thebe whips once around the planet in a little over 16 hours. #GAIA #MoonsOfJupiterA post shared by  GAIA (@gaia) on ",articles11,"['Instagram', 'Orbiting', 'Metis', 'Metis', 'Earth', 'GAIA', 'Jupiter', 'Orbiting', 'Earth', 'GAIA', 'van Buuren‘s', 'Orbiting', 'Earth', 'GAIA', 'Armin', 'Perhaps –', 'Thebe', 'Jupiter', 'Jupiter', 'GAIA']"

Recently launching his new label, “Fcking Serious,” hoping to spread ideas of good music and serious parties around the globe. He snags over 23 million views on YouTube from his 2017 Château de Fontainebleau for Cercle. He’s also graced Tomorrowland Belgium in 2018.

"Defqon.1 will not be returning this year to the Land Down Under after two deaths in 2018, a 23-year-old man from western Sydney and of the 21-year-old woman from Victoria.The festival announced on it’s Facebook page that they were unable to obtain support from Sydney International Regatta Centre and its affiliates. The New South Wales Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, previously stated that she was going to do “whatever it takes” to end the festival and to bar the festival from ever happening in New South Wales and Sydney. The festival was hosted annually in Australia since September 2009. Unfortunately last year’s deaths aren’t the first time for Defqon.1 Australia. In 2013, 1 festival goer died, 14 hospitalized, 84 charged for drug related offenses. Comments made by fans shows the devastation it is causing throughout the community. One fan states:  Another fan added: “This house was oursUntil they kicked us out#RipDefqonAus“Fans desperately urged to move the festival to other states like Perth or Adelaide, whilst others just said they’d go to Netherlands, the festival’s original and longest standing location. Fans have tried to keep the festival alive previously before; organizing a petition, “Don’t Kill Live Music”. When New South Wales government imposed strict regulations against live music festivals.The Facebook post did encourage the festival goers to enjoy other festival related events. “During this time, we welcome you to explore our events or hostings in of any of the 15 countries we are active in this year.”",articles11,['Gladys Berejiklian']
"Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas’ secret wedding in Las Vegas was supposed to stay under wraps. However, it soon became a public event after Diplo decided to live stream it and share multiple Instagram stories. We all know Diplo as the big EDM DJ/Producer who’s pretty active on Instagram. He shared one video after another and even threw the dog filter on. So for the Jonas Brothers fans, this was a gift from God. To be able to witness this moment in history and in some way be a part of it, was an honor. Luckily, Joe Jonas laughed it off and found the whole ordeal humorous in the UK “Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp” morning show. He states, “I love Diplo but he loves his ‘gram more than a 13-year-old.” Priyanka Chopra, who’s married to Nick Jonas, had accidentally let it slip that the newly-wed couple would have a beautiful second wedding. With that information, we can see why Joe Jonas didn’t mind too much about Diplo’s antics. Everyone who planned to send Diplo a wedding invite would now probably think twice about it. Hopefully, he doesn’t live stream the couple’s second wedding if he is invited then.",articles11,"['Instagram', 'Instagram', 'Jonas Brothers', 'Luckily', 'Joe Jonas', 'Priyanka Chopra', 'Nick Jonas', 'Joe Jonas', 'Diplo’s']"
"Everyone loves when people try to run on stage, am I right?? No, I am not. It seems like every month a fan attempts to run on stage to greet their favorite DJ. And for the most part, it always ends in them being tackled. This past Sunday at Sunset Music Festival a fan once again attempted to storm the stage during Dog Blood’s set. It ended how you would assume, security holding the crazy man down. It’s unclear what the man was trying to do, maybe take a selfie? This did not stop Skrillex from hopping on the mic to defend his fan. In the video, you can hear him telling security to take it easy. “No no no no no, guys guys, please, please, just chill. Just calm a little bit. I think everyone’s cool. He’s a kid, just move him out calmly”However, after a minute of resisting to leave Skrill’s attitude changed. Especially after the fan continually stated, “it’s not over, it’s not over,” when in fact the show was over. Skrillex seemed to have lost his patience. He told the man “The show is over, just go home, bro.”Let this kid be a lesson to all, it never works out to jump the barrier. Skrillex showed two good sides, being able to calm security and also knowing when something is a lost cause. Also check out Dog Blood’s new EP ‘Turn Off The Lights,’ which comes out tomorrow!

"Every year the spectacle that is EDC continues to grow by leaps and bounds. On top of this, the festival is as safe as ever. This is easy to see, as the last two years have seen an astounding zero reported deaths. This year, Insomniac teamed up with everyone’s favorite science guy, Bill Nye, to announce EDCLV’s 2019 theme, ‘‘. For a full recap of EDCLV ’19, be sure to click here. For now, check out some of this year’s most memorable moments below as chosen by the writers and editors here at EDMTunes. Insomniac has come to be known for the outstanding events and festivals they put on. It goes without saying that the Las Vegas‘ Electric Daisy Carnival is the cream of their crop. This is largely due to their amazing stage productions, and interactive areas. A nice addition to this year’s already behemoth festival grounds, was, ‘Pixel Forest‘. The Pixel Forest consisted of a walkthrough passageway with an amazing visual display, synced to some pretty gnarly music. This ended up being a great place to get away from the crowds and vibe out a bit. Check out this video, for a better idea of what the forest had to offer.Smack dab in the middle of EDCLV, was Downtown EDC. This was a rather neat area, as it included various themed bars, a pop-up, hip-hop club, as well as a full blown drag show. In addition to this, headliners were able to join in on some karaoke, and even adventure into some trippy bars. A fan favorite seemed to be the “Mini Bar”, which literally just that. Check out this video, to see what we’re talking about.One of the newer additions to EDC was its camping area, dubbed ““. While I personally did not attend, all of the buzz surrounding the camp has me itching to check it out next year. From the highly talked about pool parties to the communal feelings attendees shared, it seems like Camp EDC was the place to be. The camp also included activities such as twerk & shuffling workshops, Yoga with goats, scavenger hunts, and even headbangers therapy, so there’s that. The camp included sets from names such as Joyryde, Latmun, and even Kaskade. It seems like one of the best moments of Camp EDC was the kickoff party with none other than Fisher himself.Apart from its impeccable production value, EDC has come to be known for its art installations and roaming performance troupes. It is also known for its art cars & parades. Spread throughout the festival, these pieces of mobile art are just as good as the music being played on the stages. If you managed to venture out, you may have been lucky enough to come across some gems. One such gem was the Icarus Art Car, who made their way to EDC for the first time this year.What was easily one of the coolest art installations at this years EDC was none other than the “Paraluna”. This art installation was unlike others, as it consisted of a spinning LED fan. Headliners who found themselves under the trippy installation could easily find themselves speechless as the spinning art installation did its thing, Rezz style.This years festival was chock full of surprises. The festival grounds were full of performance troupes who more than played their part in making sure headliners felt immersed in the world that is EDC. One of my favorite parts of the night was finding my way to the Tesla Coil Electricity Show. This consisted of three performers, playing with electricity in sync with some awesome music. While there are no quality photos to share of this experience, check out a snippet of last years performance here for an idea of what we’re talking about.Another interesting aspect of EDC was the numerous parades that took place over the course of the three day weekend. While it was annoying to be cut off from your planned route between sets, the parades were quite the spectacle, as they consisted of the various art cars, music and all.EDC is not EDC, without its lineup of art cars. Specially curated, each car was its own mini, mobile stage, with loads of artist playing special sets aboard the vessels. If you were lucky, you might have caught Audien’s exclusive house set aboard the Parliament Art Car. There were loads of special moments throughout the weekend, such as Saturday, where the Brownies & Lemonade crew took over the Forest House Art Car. One moment that sticks out was randomly happening upon the Icarus Art Car. While you could usually find it in Nomads Land, It was neat to watch the art car roam about the festival grounds. This mostly due to the fact that it is modeled after a spaceship. It was a cool sight to see the crew aboard dance the night away. What was even cooler was that you could actually hop on, and join in on the fun. The ship also included a stripper pole, so I’m sure you can already imagine the kind of fun that came from that.One awesome attraction was the “Hand of God”. The Hand of God was made up of a giant mechanical metal hand. With this, you were able to pick up and crush actual cars. This is definitely something to look forward to playing with again next year.EDC would not be what it is today if it weren’t for the music. The rides, attractions, and overall ambiance are out of this world, however, it’s the music that seals the deal. Known for booking the biggest acts, and bringing in the best surprise artists, this year followed trend. One of the best moments of EDC ’19, was seeing the return of Deadmau5. Being one of the pioneers of the early EDM era, it was amazing to see the Mau5 in full form as he wowed a new generation of ravers. There was a special moment where Joel (Deadmau5) donned his signature mau5head, to which the crowd cheered with joy. This was definitely one of those moments we wish we could relive. Check out his full set here.One of the most looked forward to artist this year was none other than Illenium. If you were there, you would know that he easily had one of the biggest crowds all weekend. With a fanbase as active as his, we couldn’t imagine it any other way. Check out his set here.Another artist who blew EDC away happened to be the Australian DJ & record producer, What So Not. Fans new, and old were blown away as he made sure to play a great amount of his “OG Hits”. Check out his full set here.One of the most hyped sets of the whole weekend was the special B2B between Rusko & Skream. The two Dubstep legends took the crowd back to the golden age of dubstep, demolishing the bassPOD in the process. Check out their set here.One of the biggest moments of the whole weekend was easily the surprise Skrillex set. Literally taking over circuitGROUNDS, Skrillex blew EDC away. I’m sure I wouldn’t be wrong in assuming that he had the biggest crowd all weekend. Relive his epic set here.Last but not least is Zhu. Taking over the cosmicMEADOW, he brought his unique, deep, blend of house music. Zhu even took the stage and played a couple of instruments live, to include a saxophone. Easily one of the most memorable sets, be sure to check out his set here.For a more in depth list of this years EDC sets, be sure to check this out.The vibe that EDC Las Vegas is able to produce is seriously otherworldly. From the artists to the rides, the installations, and art cars, the energy inside the Las Vegas Motor Speedway is hard to replicate. One of the main reasons this can be attributed to is due to the people who attended, AKA the headliners. Everything from the incredible Totems, to the random Naked Guy, made the weekend so much better. It was plain to see that EDC LV was quite the vibe. Don’t even get us started on all of the Memes that the festival spawned.If you’ve yet to make the journey to The Electric Daisy Carnival, this is definitely something you need to do, trust me. With the dates for the 2020 edition of The Electric Daisy Carnival already set, there is no excuse not to make it out next year.

"Ever heard of DanceSafe? They are a public health organization promoting health and safety within the nightlife and electronic dance music community. They strive to make our world a safer place and recently they have made Colorado a better place. Under their state law, drug testing kits used to be considered drug paraphernalia, but now they are not. Colorado Governor, Jared Polis, signed a few bills on Thursday, May 23rd in attempt to curb the opioid epidemic. Senate Bill 19-227 is a new law focused on harm reduction and will likely save lives.Since the late 90s, DanceSafe cultivated, promoted, and educated for safe rave culture. While their latest accomplishment has improved one state, they’re aiming for this law to overturn against all test kits in the US by 2021. DanceSafe Executive Director, Mitchell Gomez, believes that most drug laws do more harm than good. Banning the use or sales of drugs will only bring it about more. Paraphernalia statutes criminalize drug consumption through those bans of needles and test kits. In turn, that leads to the spread of communicable diseases. It is going to be a long fight for change, but is incremental. The goal is a more rational drug policy. With no opposition from Colorado on the new law, the future seems promising for this. When explained properly, it is easy to understand and support these harm reduction measures. Being safe and preventive in these kinds of things will make our future a better place to live. The number of deaths at festivals has been quite low, so let’s keep that up. Remind yourselves that anything can happen, and your safety is most important.

"We at EDMTunes had the great privilege of sitting down with Jan Blomqvist, Berlin-based artist, producer, DJ and bandleader! Jan is known for his unique approach towards dance music – pioneering concert techno infused with ethereal vocals and pulsating melodies. He is the bandleader of BLOMQVIST and is currently on his Disconnected Album tour – be sure to check out his upcoming tour dates! Thanks for sitting down with us! So first off, we wanted to discuss if you had any new projects or music coming out that you want to share with us? Jan Blomqvist: I’m, of course, working on new stuff, but I don’t like to talk about that stuff. Rule number one – what I learned in Berlin is never, ever talk about things you want to do, just do it!What about your latest release? How are fans responding to that? Jan Blomqvist: I’m pretty happy. Many people are reading the lyrics and realized it’s a concept album. We’re 9,000 kilometers from home and people know my lyrics! Were you nervous putting out a concept album and wondering how it would be received? Jan Blomqvist: No. I knew that’s always easier. If I give a concept album with a certain idea, and everything logically follows, than the questions are way more interesting with the press. Because normally, if you have no concept album, if you just release tracks – it’s always the same questions, all the time, and it’s really hard to work with the press. It’s way more interesting for both sides, I think, if you have an idea.That makes a lot of sense! Next, we’d love to hear about who you would be most excited to collaborate with on a project?Jan Blomqvist: Stephan Bodzin!Do you want to speak a little bit to your career overall? Now, playing Coachella – with two huge sets. What did it take from the beginning to get where you are now? and how does it feel to be here now?  Jan Blomqvist: There was a slow step-by-step process. I never had this like, one hit wonder thing. It was like a journey, which I expected, and I’m fine with that. It was not like this, “bang!” Like, fuck I’m here. Is there anything else you want to cover or promote? Jan Blomqvist:  Actually, the last album tour was amazing, and the album should come to people here right now. I feel like people know all my tracks from two years, the old album – Remote Control, and I think the new album, Disconnected, is worth it to listen to the lyrics, and come to my show next time!

The two found creative chemistry in 2017 when they released ‘Coffee Can Money.’ This week they collaborated on ‘Better Anyway,’ an empowering and inspiring single. The new crossover track is upbeat yet chill throughout. It begins with some amazing vocals. As the song progresses we are brought into a super fun drop with an awesome bassline. I find it perfect for a nice beach day where you just want to dance. Borgeous had this to say about the track:“I hope this song can help people who are going through a hard break-up to find happiness in their independence and to know they’ll make it out okay.”RUNAGROUND also believed in the song’s power to lift you up. It provides a summer feel that is hard to find in other tracks. In life there are a lot of setbacks, hopefully, their new song puts you back on the path upward. Both artists are currently on tour.

"The Alchemy Tour has officially announced its first show on the road since teasing it! Blending together some powerhouse names in electronic music, NGHTMRE, Slander, Seven Lions and The Glitch Mob will be sharing a stage. Bringing forth the first date on the tour, all artists will be performing in SOCAL. They announced the show at Marina Green in Long Beach, taking place on August 17. That will give you plenty of time to prepare!Considering the caliber of each artist and the stage structures they put on, we can only wonder as to what stages we can expect. For example, in recent past The Glitch Mob finished touring with their Blade 2. Furthermore, Slander demonstrated The Eye stage on May 17 in Eugene, Oregon.

"When you hear Deadmau5 and Martin Garrix, you wouldn’t normally associate them as friends. It wasn’t too long ago that Joel trolled Garrix at Ultra. However, the mau5 posted a video that debunked that myth and it is truly so sweet. Recently, the two spent some time together in Vegas at Top Golf. Having both played EDC this month, below is a tidbit of their time recorded together.Set to the most wholesome of songs, the Wii Sports theme, doesn’t this just make your heart flutter and your face droop in “Awws”? I think we can tell a bromance when we see one. In its most unexpected way, this pairing seems to be getting along swimmingly. What better way to let off some steam or calm the nerves than a little bit of golf in the desert? The guys can be seen taking turns swinging and trying to see who can get the most points. Interjecting between smiles and laughs are various clips of famous golf players with their victory poses. You can see Garrix dancing and having a great time. You see Joel mentioning that “those long drive guys don’t f**k around”. I mean, we believe that. Driving in golf is no ordinary feat, let alone trying to beat your competition in the best way possible. Could there be more videos of their bonding time we don’t know about it? Until we find out, check out Deadmau5 and Martin Garrix in the video below!mcfly vs sucklord cc: Martin Garrix📹 Leah Sems",articles11,['Martin Garrix']
"We Are FSTVL kicked off on this Bank Holiday Weekend to a rather rocky start at the Damyns Hall Aerodrome. Headlined by acts like Chase & Status, The Black Madonna & Jaime Jones (plus a killer RESISTANCE lineup), We Are FSTVL is one of the best bank holiday festivals the UK offers. However, a BBC report says this year hundreds of people were stuck in lines for up to three hours in hot weather – a lack of wristbands being mentioned as the cause of the delay. Due to the heat, some people ended up collapsing and vomiting, but worst of all the commotion caused a stampede.Multiple ravers got caught in it & suffered wounds by the metal barriers that were apparently being flung around. And according to the festival attendees they had no access to water, food or toilets in the blistering heat during the whole drama. Frustration & dehydration ultimately served as fuel for the stampede.  We Are FSTVL, which ran from Friday to Sunday, issued a brief statement on Saturday night apologizing for the chaos, Our sincere apologies for anyone that experienced delays coming into the show today.A reminder to weekend ticket…““We apologise for the delay in getting in, but can assure you we are doing this as fast and safely as possible.

"Business Techno is no joke. The legal battle between Marco Carola & Ibiza promoters continues. Last Wednesday (May 22) Carola was summoned to an Ibiza court to speak on the matter. He straight out denied all of the contract breach accusations made against him by Amnesia Ibiza and It’s All About The Music SL. The drama picked up about a week before his court date when both parties sued him for moving his residency to rival club Pacha. Carola’s current contracts with Amnesia and Its All About The Music SL forbids him from performing anywhere else on the island aside from Amnesia. This contract had also been backed by court orders earlier.With this case, Marco Carola finds himself in a bit of a pickle. This is because Carola has over two dozen shows planned on the island throughout the season. Each time he plays outside Amnesia, he risks fines north of €2.4 million. Furthermore, It’s All About The Music SL requests “full seizure” of Carola’s assets while the case goes to court, but Carola’s lawyers have been able to block the motion on account of him not being eligible for such drastic measures. In the event Marco loses the case, he’d be liable for at least €6.6 million in damages to both Amnesia and It’s All About The Music SL.",articles11,"['Ibiza', 'Ibiza', 'Amnesia Ibiza', 'Carola’s', 'Amnesia', 'Amnesia', 'Amnesia', 'Amnesia']"

"Almost two months after canceling the rest of his Visceral tour, Getter is ready to jump back into showing the world his newest body of work. Getter has announced that he will be playing a Visceral set at the Brownies & Lemonade Block Party in Los Angeles, California on July 3rd.  LOS ANGELESA post shared by  getter (@getter) on As a result of receiving criticism for playing his newest album, Getter canceled his tour in early April.

"It seems like when you’ve finally got the latest iPhone, Apple is moving on to something bigger and better. After getting rid of the headphone jack, Apple has been making wireless audio its priority for the iPhone 11. Now Apple is exploring ways to have two audio signals to be transmitted to a single iPhone. Having multiple audio streams means that the user could connect two pairs of AirPods to the same iPhone. You could also connect the phone to a Speaker’s Bluetooth system while keeping your Bluetooth headset connected. There are lots of possibilities here, but wireless audio still has room for improvement. Samsung smartphones already have this feature available, but they require Bluetooth 5.0 for it to work properly. Apple can implement dual audio in the same way, since many older iPhones already support Bluetooth 5.0. Therefore, owners of the iPhone 8, iPhone X, and iPhone XS would only need to update to the latest version of IOS to support the new feature.Lastly, the iPhone 11 may bring back Touch ID. A new report says that Apple plans to reintroduce Touch ID alongside Face ID to create dual biometric security. However, all iPhones in 2019 will not be getting 5G technology as that is now being pushed back till 2020.",articles11,"['iPhone', 'iPhone', 'iPhone', 'Samsung', 'iPhone X', '5G']"
"EDC Vegas is arguably one of the largest events held in the bustling city of Las Vegas each year. Thousands attend the 3 day festival, creating memories for a lifetime. Although so many of us find joy and happiness in this magical environment, there are some who despise the event. A 20 year old man was recently jailed on an attempted murder charge after running over his girlfriend after finding out she went to EDC. After seeing his girlfriend (not to be named) enjoying EDC on Instagram, Ryan Mansour left his job at the Red Rock Resort movie theater, fueled with rage. He drove to his girlfriends house “to get back all the things he ever gave her”. For some reason, Mansour believed she “did not deserve the cards or bears he gave her in the past”. Soon after arriving, the two had a verbal argument over the event. Eventually, they both got back inside the car to talk over their situation. Unfortunately, the argument escalated and the woman proceeded to leave the vehicle. The arrest report then states that Mansour “lost sight of her” in a parking lot they stopped in. Mansour claims he backed up, put the car in drive, and proceeded forward until he heard her yelling ‘stop, stop,”. “Ryan stated he did not run her over on purpose but admitted he was full of rage and made a dumb mistake due to his state of mind”Mansour failed to ensure his girlfriend was out of harms way as he drove off. His car ran over her, leaving her body trapped under the body of the vehicle. Mansour’s attorney Gabe Grasso, maintains that Mansour quickly reacted to save his girlfriend after realizing she was trapped. Still, she suffered a broken leg, arm, and pelvis, along with a lacerated liver, collapsed lung, and burns to her face and body from the car’s exhaust. We hope for a quick and full recovery to the girlfriend after this tragic event. ",articles11,"['Instagram', 'rage', 'rage']"

Deadmau5 will not only be in Vegas to show off his outstanding music, but now he will be able to incorporate his knowledge in technology as well. It’s been four years since Deadmau5 has returned to Vegas, but the come back could not be any more perfect. KAOS Nightclub is not like any other nightclub in Las Vegas; According to the Las Vegas Weekly, Joel Zimmerman expressed how impressive the LED lights in the club are. The new and improved technology can also impose many difficult obstacles along with the new residency. “As far as I know, it’s the highest-res single system in North America.

"Yup, you read that right. An organization in the UK is calling for schools to replace classical music lessons with contemporary music (i.e., grime, hip-hop, electronic). Youth Music is a charity that focuses on teaching music to the youth regardless of their socioeconomic background. They believe music is the key to changing someone’s life.Currently, Youth Music is pressuring the school system in the UK to open its ears. There has been a success in including DJing into the UK’s GCSE music curriculum. The rise of electronic production has changed the way musicians approach music. Pop culture has, for the most part, embraced the crazy synths and deep-basslines to the point where young people forget about orchestras and symphonies. But should classical music be replaced completely? Many producers and DJs today were once classical musicians. For instance, Alison Wonderland began as a cellist and Morgan Then of SLUMBERJACK is a classically trained pianist. So, there are definitely benefits in taking a traditional approach. What Youth Music is really pushing for is the chance to reach children who are otherwise disinterested in music. Youth Music released an impact report regarding the success of their programs. Overall, diversifying the music curriculum seems like the right move. Hopefully, the US will take note and implement a similar program.

"Kelsey Lu first dropped the Skrillex-produced “Due West” back in November and it was very well received. And just a few days ago, Skrillex tweeted out that his own remix will be coming this Friday. ‘Due West’ itself is a soft and slow tune that you couldn’t guess was produced by Skrillex unless you looked at the credits. Kelsey’s voice was the real star of the track, taking it to the next level. But now, Skrillex has come forward to put his own spin on the track.Fans who were hoping for a return to his original style will be left disappointed. But its a solid remix that adds a fair amount of funk to the otherwise slow & soft vibe. It’s more akin to what we’ve been seeing Sonny put out more lately.

"One of the most shocking moments of Ultra Music Festival this year back in March was Armin van Buuren‘s surprise guest appearance of David Lee Roth of Van Halen. Fast forward two months and the two legends now have released a brand new collaboration in one of Van Halen’s most iconic tracks ‘Jump‘. Armin takes the incredible rock song and puts a dance spin to it to fit a modern day party. While in Las Vegas last weekend, we had the special opportunity to interview the two legends to talk to them about their newest remix together as well as discuss with them the similarities of today’s dance music scene compared to the rock music scene decades ago:The new remix of ‘Jump’ just released. One of my personal favorites songs ‘Jump’. Tell us how this collaboration came about.ArminWell it’s very simple, when I was a little kid I heard the original and I was surprised that nobody actually did an official remix sort of to translate it into the modern dance music world. So I was quite bold and I asked my publisher if he knew somebody who got the stems and he knew somebody. So I got the original stems which was exciting because I’m a bit of a nerd like that. I like to listen to all the individual how how a track like that message an iconic track is constructed so I took some time to actually sync everything up because it’s not written on the click track.David: I’d start playing that ‘Jumper’ if I’m not going to lie first I’m crazy. I’m surprised though and then we’ll recreate it the rift. OK. You’ll notice that after the end of every solo and every famous Van Halen song the horses get turned around they know they’re going back to the stable and they move faster. And we let it happen. Yeah it’s a crescendo. You start it or you’ll be out four beats a minute faster than it started yet keenly. When we went into the studio Ted Templeman biggest thing was pulling the reins because Van Halen Live is always a little faster than you might expect that horse. Yes speed it up for the crowd. Well no it’s not a hundred. Hundred and twenty six or 128 depending on the final crushing plant in the Midwest that you’ve got your desk front. Oh that’s not a coincidence either. That’s danceable music that was my forte in the band. Take it hard rock power trio material and making it really danceable girl friendly. That was an imperative. So out of most of the Van Halen hits that you know are super girl friendly. In fact something like Jamie’s crime that’s a rumba music. This is your first time at EDC this weekend Dave. What are you most excited looking forward to? : This is a collection and a demonstration of neighborhoods and communities that everybody talks about. We talk about world peace and that’s a great answer to anything. If you’re doing an interview in mine. And you run out of the answers just say world peace you should. Dave How come you guys did this track. Well in the name of world peace. DAVE. DAVE How come that drag bombed. Well people were more interested in world peace that way if you were listening to ‘We Are The World.’ What’s happening right now is a lot of collaborations in the urban R&B world which is fine and I think it’s great. But I wanted to take the jumping collaborate with the job the way I see it. Armin: It’s like perfect. Yeah. Nobody saw that one coming and it’s a part is a phase where I mean in my career where I guess I’m just a little bit more comfortable in sort of figuring out my comfort zone but sometimes it is fueled by you’ll see me do more this year. Obviously you get the Armin that you’re into because I always come home the end of the day cause my loyalty is to transport what fuels my passion for trance. It’s trying to look to where the boundaries are or boundaries that other people set for me and I remember I’m a little rebellious in the sense that I feel it’s my obligation as a performer as an artist that I need to shock people a little bit and working with David Lee is something that. Not a lot of people saw it coming but I guess that’s what makes it exciting and you guys can decide what you thought it was a good collaboration or bad. It’s up to you. DavidThink of it as you find that chocolate and the first time somebody said you should combine that with peanut butter, the world said it’s pretty good. Nowadays somebody is driving around an 800 foot sailboat named Buttercup.So I know a lot of what my appeal was growing up in music was that classic rock, our parents were like look at how cool it was especially with Van Halen and I think that was a little bit of our appeal coming up into EDM music as well. What would you say the comparison is in your mind having seen it 30 years ago with Van Halen and now that something like EDC, what are the similarities between the two cultures?DavidI think you got rid of the boring rock band O nine and a half times out of 10. Maybe there’s one guy in the band that’s really interesting to look at. You’re lucky. Lucky if there’s two. And the rest looked like. They walked out in the back of a play. The rhythm section routinely looks like they came around from behind the counter at Pep Boys. Finally somebody in our government said let’s get rid of that and spend the money on lights. : I think there is an end. There was an energy to Van Halen and specifically David Lee on stage back in the day when you saw him perform. That is still in the song and it’s still with David as we speak. I mean we did it at Australian. You saw the reviews. I find it exciting to do this because it feels to me like it’s the appropriate message for this generation as well. Might as well jump a lot of rock and roll from my genre. My community looks at us to our craft. Look what we can do. My personal approach is the opposite of that. It’s all about “how are you, I got somebody you should meet, here’s a song.”That fits perfectly with modern. David Lee Roth has been staying active in more ways than just music. The iconic rock legend has announced his own podcast show called “The Roth Show“. You can check out all episodes of the podcast on his site here as well as on YouTube now.

The initial release of the label is called ‘Sirius’ by a new artist named Cityzen. The track is a rather interesting track as it presents sounds of the past and the future at the same time. When producing ‘Sirius’, Cityzen drew inspiration of the hard and dirty sounds of electronic music from the 80s all while infusing sounds of present day EDM. This interesting combination is presented in his latest song which will also be the preceding direction of Cityzen’s forthcoming music.

Between the two, they have been behind a number of previous releases & signed records to some of the worlds most revered labels. Today we bring you a new track from the dynamic pair, and we think you are going to love it.The track in question is a cover of the platinum-certified Red Hot Chili Pepper track, ‘Under the Bridge‘. The remake features a unique spin on dance music, an eclectic blend of live/acoustic instruments and electronic soundscapes. After listening to some of their other music, it is easy to see that they draw their sound from numerous other influences such as latin and hip-hop.The track starts out with Atwater‘s vocals paired with some guitar strumming. Other elements come in to include the drums, as well as a more melodic guitar riff, and some trap-esque hi-hats. Once the trumpets come into play, the track takes on a whole new energy level, and we think you are going to love it.

"A music festival is more than just a stack roster of performing talent. It is the overall experience from the presentation to the organization that defines a music festival and no one does a better job of that than EDC Las Vegas. When going to EDC Las Vegas, you expect to enter an alternative reality-like fantasy. This year’s EDC did not disappoint just as they continue to impress every year.Last year’s EDC was the first time the festival moved their dates up from June to May and this may have been one of the best decisions the festival has ever made. In previous years, people always complained about how excruciatingly hot but this year was quite the opposite. For the most part the event was smooth sailing but the festival did encounter strong winds on Day 2 that shut down some of the stages but overall the winds could have easily have been overlooked with a hoodie.To ensure that attendees stayed hydrated, the festival had countless water stations for everyone to fill up their camelbacks in timely fashion. Similarly, there were also ample amounts of bathroom locations which allowed fans to run in and out minus the long lines. In addition, for those who wanted to consume alcohol, there were many bars scattered around festival grounds so that drinks can be at your disposal in a matter of minutes. The only criticism in regards to alcohol was the lack of 21+ bracelets. The absence of these bracelets forced attendees to constantly have their IDs checked each and every time they approached the bar which could be quite the hassle. In terms of presentation, every EDM fan in the world knows that EDC Las Vegas is pretty much unrivaled in their creativity with the exception of maybe Tomorrowland. The stage designs were all equally as creative so that any first time attendee may find it hard to depict which stage was the mainstage. Kinetic Field, Cosmic Meadows and the Neon Garden stages were all incredibly massive. But of all the stages at this year’s festival, Circuit Grounds was my personal favorite. Designed to reflect electrical currents, the stage had LED screens that basically went all around you to make everyone feel absolutely immersed into the experience. With so many stages and talents present at this year’s festival, there’s bound to be some sort of clashing of your favorite acts. But of course, nothing could have been more upsetting than sacrificing who ever was scheduled on our list at 10:30 Saturday night for Skrillex‘s surprise performance. With less than a day to spare, the dubstep king announced that he will be performing the Circuit Grounds stage as the surprise guest. This shocking announcement definitely stirred up a lot of buzz and enhanced suddenly drew what felt like more than half the festival to his stage. Even with all this hype however, his set did not disappoint as he played tracks for everyone and obviously incorporating his countless classics throughout his set. Just one year ago, Elephante was one of the earlier openers of the festival but this year he closed out the Circuit Grounds stage with one of the biggest closing crowds of the weekend. Playing at 4:20 AM is no easy job as fans tend to tire out from a full day of dancing but there was definitely no shortage of energy as everyone danced until sun up during Elephante’s closing set. Fireworks lit up the sky as he played a combination of melodic tunes and heavy bangers to the crowd’s delight. After throwing down an unforgettable performance, many fans showed up on Saturday to catch Elephante’s second set of the weekend at the Corona Electric Beach stage so there was absolutely no reason to miss out on this spectacular act.Another artist that had the crowd booming with excitement was Illenium who played the prime time 1:30 AM slot at the Circuit Grounds stage. His mesmerizing melodic tracks sent chills all throughout the crowd. The combination of music and presentation including fire works and pyro made his hour and a half performance feel like a dream. He closed out his set with his new unreleased collaboration with The Chainsmokers but not long after stepping off the stage, Illenium reappeared during Ekali’s set to debut their new collaboration together as well.

"We all suffer tough days at the office but probably not ones that take us to the 1960s and back in one day. If you do, then it’s probably because someone in the office is trying to fix the vibes. Nevertheless, Eliot Curtis of KPIX Television can now add some new experience to his resume- time travel. After accidentally absorbing LSD while repairing a vintage Buchla 100 Series Modular synthesizer, he took a ‘trip’ back in time.““Now, this may come as no surprise to you if you understand the history of the Buchla 100 Series. Reporting on the incident, KPIX 5 reached out to electronic music pioneer Suzanne Ciani for a history lesson. She worked with the creator of the device, Don Buchla, and attended UC Berkely during Berkely’s time at the forefront of ’60’s era counterculture. From this, one can start to piece together how LSD fits into the story. She admits Buchla was not only an LSD user but also close to Owsley ‘Bear’ Stanley. Widely known as the genius sound engineer for The Grateful Dead, he was also known for selling extremely pure acid. The question still remains, however, of how the drugs get into this particular device. Digging deeper into the lore of the Buchla 100 may quash your skepticism. Apparently, an urban legend alleges Buchla dips his synthesizers in LSD. Furthermore, allegedly, a mere wet finger along the device induces a mind-expanding experience. Additionally, Professors Glenn Glasow and Robert Basart likely commissioned the device in hopes of exploiting this feature. After unwittingly wetting some residue with solvent and attempting to scrape it off, Mr. Curtis possibly just proved it all to be true. Nine psychedelic hours and three chemical tests later, there’s no question Curtis had an LSD trip. It’s quite remarkable that such an innocuous instrument is actually quite the window into the past. Ciani had a point when she said this:  Whether or not the Buchla 100 legend is true, we all have to draw the same conclusion: This whole thing is pretty trippy. Check out KPIX 5’s video of the report below. ",articles11,"['Suzanne Ciani', 'Berkely’s', '’60', 'The Grateful Dead', 'Robert Basart', 'Mr. Curtis', 'Nine', 'Ciani']"
"This past weekend, EDC Las Vegas brought thousands of people from around the world together again at the Motor Speedway. Memories were made as both veterans and first-timers experienced a variety of DJs offered over the 3 days. Unfortunately, high winds put a hold on the festival on Saturday night. Event organizers closed the kineticField and Quantum Valley stages and attendees were told to evacuate and find shelter. Fortunately, after a few hours, festival-goers were allowed re-entry into the area and both stages reopened. Even though the festival resumed normal activities, it would be impossible to make up for missed performances. Kaskade was one of the artists who were unable to perform due to the winds. Sadly, it wasn’t possible to reschedule his main stage set that weekend and fans would have to move on. On Facebook, Kaskade voiced his frustration but stated that “it was the right call” to close the stage. Still, after weeks of preparation both mentally and music-wise, it was a big let-down. Like any athlete preparing for an event, Kaskade mentioned his rush of adrenaline and eagerness to get on the stage in Las Vegas. In the end, it was just not meant to be. Mother Nature is just a force impossible to combat, especially with outdoor events. Fans still have a chance to see Kaskade play in Vegas, as he is a resident at KAOS, located in the Palms Casino. His next gig at KAOS is set for Saturday, May 25th! Moreover, he says he’s hoping that those who missed out at EDC will be able to make a show in the near future.

"Rufus Du Sol showed Miami why they are the band of the future in a mesmerizing display at Downtown’s famed Bayfront Park. As a huge fan of dance music, I realized that it had been years since I had gone to a proper “concert”. You know like where there is just one stage and one headlining act, and it isn’t a DJ. I remember that years ago before EDM I had gotten bored of traditional concerts. Rufus Du Sol, more so than any other artist I’ve seen, brings these two worlds together in in a way that makes them feel unlike anything else out there.Obviously Bayfront Park is a great venue for any concert, but the weather and the vibes for this night were perfect. In the wake of all of these arguments concerning Ultra it was hard not to romanticize Bayfront Park during this night. The opener Jan Blomqvist set the mood with some groovy deeper house that had everybody moving as the sun began to set. Then Rufus took some time to do a set change, and you saw that they had a full band setup complete with their production equipment and everything. This concept may have started in a way with WORLDS, but it’s fully formed here. The trio seamlessly transitions between original mixes of their songs performed with live instrumentation and impromptu jam techno jam sessions. Imagine techno beats performed completely live by production equipment and drum machines – it’s really something to behold. The thing that really struck me is how this band I’ve only known for maybe 2 years has such a deep catalog of timeless music already. From beginning to end of about 90 minutes the band went from hit to hit, each one feeling like a crescendo worthy of a final song. Just when you thought they might be finished and you heard every song you knew – BAM they hit you with another track that had you saying “oh sh*t I totally forgot about this one – i LOVE this song”. There was maybe 1 song the entire night that I didn’t know all the words to, but every song had the crowd singing and moving along as the lights flickered off of Miami’s downtown skyline. Do yourself a favor and don’t miss Rufus Du Sol on their tour when they come to your city. ",articles11,"['Rufus Du Sol', 'EDM I', 'Rufus Du Sol', 'Bayfront Park', 'Miami’s']"
"Congrats Electric Daisy Carnival! They have officially reported no deaths for the 2nd year in a row. For a long time, EDC Las Vegas struggled to have a festival with zero fatalities. The media has always feasted on electronic music festivals for the number of deaths they produce, painting a negative picture of a festival that brings so much joy to many. Deaths at EDC were long attributed to the high temperatures in June. Last year they made a massive change to move the festival to May and it seems to have worked. In combination with superb hydration lines and better medical assistance, deaths have decreased dramatically at the desert festival. EDC drew a record 465,000 people this year over the course of three days. Arrests even decreased from 2018 to 2019. The only downside from moving the festival up a few weeks was the potential for higher winds. This negative effect was seen when they had to evacuate some stages on Day 2. We hope this positive trend of no deaths can be celebrated for years to come. It would be awesome for this to become the norm and hopefully not report it as news in a few years.

"Is the golden era of EDM over? With a new report from the International Music Summit’s annual economic study, alarming statistics show a steep decline in EDM’s share of the music market; which is almost down to 3% in 2018 in the USA alone. A closer look into the data shows a steady decline from 3.5% in 2017, and 4% in 2016. With a significant decline in the USA & UK, EDM rebounded in both Germany and Canada with a 7.1% increase and a 5.9% increase. Perhaps the Deadmau5 cube show has helped with his Canadian fanbase. As for DJ earnings; highest-paid DJs fell dramatically. The top 10 total of $261 million was the lowest it has been since 2013. According to the report, Calvin Harris remained the top paid DJ at $48 million, lower than the $48.5 million he pulled in 2017 with The Chainsmokers in a close second, with earnings up 20% from the previous year to $45.5 million. Check out the full report here. ",articles11,['EDM’s']
"Hot off EDC Las Vegas 2019, it’s all systems go in the Andrew Bayer studio. His next delivery on Anjunabeats continues in a club-centric vein with two new singles titled ‘Only You Boy‘ and ‘Eight To Sixteen’. There’s no resting here because these two are genre setting bangers.Andrew Bayer is continuing his streak in club-trained trance, to his ever-growing repertoire dive deeper into our psyche. This is a man we know and love through all his numerous cult favorites of trance. However, ‘Only You Boy’ is my favorite of the two. It is truly a return to dark clubs filled with the synth-heavy sounds of the 90s. The track includes elements of electro house and bass therefore being memorable and one to dance to. With a break in the middle, the tempo slows down and the melody chills out. Although breaks in trance are common, what follows after is a symphony leading up to the greatest drop reminiscent of Artificial’s ‘Stuck in Sa Caleta’. ‘Eight To Sixteen’ delivers a cutting-edge sound alongside a nostalgic essence from the genre’s inception. It has a melodic uplift in its drop and propels you through the ages. You can hear Bayer’s signature sound in this one. The light, airy ambience you feel as you listen casts waves of emotion over you. If you’ve been lucky enough to see Andrew Bayer this past weekend or along the Anjunabeats North American Tour, that’s great. But if you haven’t, you can catch him at Above & Beyond’s return to the Gorge Amphitheater for the Group Therapy Weekender on July 27 and 28. You can purchase tickets here.

"Electric Daisy Carnival has been known to have its fair share of nudity. Each year it seems like someone is stripping down ready to dance the night away. In 2016, a naked man dove off of a stage straight on his head. This year, a man on 6-8 acid tabs felt he also needed to take off his clothes at Quantum Valley. Over the last few days, the man has taken to Reddit to answer some much-needed questions. People asked questions about what he was on, how he felt the next day, and why he did it. He feels embarrassed about the whole situation. Between the memes and videos, he felt this Q&A was needed. Some interesting takeaways from the Reddit page were after he removed his clothes the police surrounded him. They actually cut off his wristband but he was able to replace it for $40. One of the big things he was talking about was facing “Ego Death.” He believed he had entered a higher state of communal consciousness that all humans would eventually be a part of. He had this to say about the experience:When consuming any type of drug at a music festival is super important to remember your limits. Sure it can be fun to take a large dose but there are consequences that might come along with it. This is a perfect example of how things can go very wrong and how you can lose focus of why you came to the festival in the first place. ",articles11,"['Reddit', 'Reddit', 'Sure']"

"The Armada Music mother ship has touched down with another fabulous collaboration. Certainly, this is an occasion which causes the masses to gather in anticipation. Emerging from the fog are Purple Haze and KhoMha with a new offering of exotic sounds. The duo is making the first contact with this new project and their message is, ‘We Come In Peace.’ Robert Alzate, aka KhoMha, is quickly rising on every trance and progressive chart since signing with Markus Schultz. Making the jump to Armada seems to be paying off and ‘We Come In Peace’ is the result of that. Sander Van Doorn obviously needs no introduction however his alter ego, Purple Haze, is more of an enigma. Due to his lack of an outlet for his darker, harder-hitting productions, this new moniker was spawned.YES SIR 🔥🔥🛸🛸🛸 https://t.co/wnjayd1p2IThe combination of KhoMha’s high octane style and the dark, tech-trance Purple Haze vibes culminates with ‘We Come In Peace.’ The track seems as though it’s spliced from two. The first half is more of a euphoric buildup drawing you in with energy uplifting melodies. Subsequently, the latter half of the track is noticeably rougher. Accordingly, the elements of electro and booming tech-trance resemble an expulsion of the pent-up energy created in the track’s opening. The first impression of ‘We Come In Peace’ is that it’s obviously intended to be a dance floor killer. It’s something that every DJ needs to have in their arsenal.

"Over the past weekend, more than 450,000 people attended EDC Las Vegas to party under the electric sky. Many new friendships and memories were made throughout the 3 day festival. However, before the festival even began, Hakkasan Group took it a step further and already brought the electric sky indoors during Tiesto’s Thursday night party at Hakkasan Nightclub.So how exactly did they do it? Hakkasan Group has brought in a futuristic multi-million dollar grid of light installations in its renowned nightclub located at the MGM Grand. Titled the Hakkasan Grid, it was engineered by German company WhiteVoid and is the largest permanent kinetic light installation in the United States. The 30 foot sculpture is a massive spectacle in person. Constructed from 57 state of the art 3D printed triangles that are 4 feet in height, they provide attendees with a truly innovative clubbing experience. Coded using Hakkasan’s proprietary software, the triangles are able to change colors and transform to create a revolutionary sight to see.In a recent press release, here is what Hakkasan Groups’ executive vice president of entertainment James Algate had to say:And what better DJ was there than Tiesto to launch such a grandiose project the day before EDC?Luckily for EDMTunes, we got the chance to see everything in action on the launch day. Walking into the main room, thousands of eager attendees were rocking out in the famed night club. Amidst all of the bumping tunes stood the Hakkasan Grid showering an infinite amount of shapes, lights, spectrums, and, figures down onto the guests. While standing under the installation, I experienced a full-blown sensory overload of euphoria. With Tiesto as the pilot in the soundwave department, the Grid took full advantage of all the music – flawlessly transforming to match every beat.

In fact, Miami commissioners are seeking a way to save the future for the festival. Despite the fact that the discussion today did not go in Ultra’s favor, commissioners are still fighting to find a solution for the festival in 2020. Earlier this year, Ultra ended their contract with their recent location at Virginia Key due to various reasons leading to an unsafe environment for the festival. Ultra was never bad for Miami’s economy; in previous years, the festival managed to bring in $79 million into the city of Miami. However, many topics such as time change of the festival and raising the age limit to 21+ were taken into account.

Since moving to May, attendees have been experiencing all forms of weather during the festival.This year, the event featured a few dust storms, high winds (which forced down certain stages on Day 2), and low temperatures in the 50s.While many headliners went to the merchandise tent for extras layers, Zhu planned ahead and wore an extremely thick jacket.However, this was not your ordinary faux fur jacket to block the winds. Back in March, the artist took to Instagram requesting any individual to send their past festival wristbands to a California location for a special project that he and Nightday Collection have been working on. Nightday works with Zhu to create a more higher-end merchandise collection for fans to purchase to support the DJ.Many jumped at the opportunity to send their old wristbands for the chance to feel connected with Zhu. The mysteriousness surrounding the project with Nightday prompted the artist to hold a merchandise popup shop before EDC began.

"Dance music artist, philanthropist, & activist Moby tells all in his latest memoir Then It All Fell Apart. The renown musician discusses his rise from the streets to being an international artist and his many personal affairs in between. One affair in particular has caught the attention of his readers – he claims that he had a brief romantic relationship with actress & ‘Star Wars’ heroine Natalie Portman.In an interview with Harpers Baazar, Ms. Portman explained her feelings of a much older man approaching a much younger woman. Portman; 18 years  & Moby; 33, during the alleged relationship, as being inappropriate.“I was surprised to hear that he characterized the very short time that I knew him as dating because my recollection is a much older man being creepy with me…”“…My recollection of Moby is an older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school”– Natalie Portman to Harpers Baazar Moby responded with a post on Instagram stating his confusion regarding Ms. Portman’s statement denying the two of them ever having dated.“I recently read a gossip piece wherein Natalie Portman said that we’d never dated. This confused me, as we did, in fact, date. And after briefly dating in 1999 we remained friends for years…”Moby continued to respond to backlash from various Portman fans, stating there is ample evidence & photographs depicting the two as being romantically involved.A few days later, Moby released an apology on his Instagram about the debacle.As some time has passed I’ve realized that many of the criticisms leveled at me regarding my inclusion of Natalie in Then It Fell Apart are very valid. I also fully recognize that it was truly inconsiderate of me to not let her know about her inclusion in the book beforehand, and equally inconsiderate for me to not fully respect her reaction. I have a lot of admiration for Natalie, for her intelligence, creativity, and animal rights activism, and I hate that I might have caused her and her family distress. I tried to treat everyone I included in Then It Fell Apart with dignity and respect, but nonetheless it was truly inconsiderate for me to not let them know before the book was released. So for that I apologize, to Natalie, as well as the other people I wrote about in Then It Fell Apart without telling them beforehand. Also I accept that given the dynamic of our almost 14 year age difference I absolutely should’ve acted more responsibly and respectfully when Natalie and I first met almost 20 years ago.

"The Ultra bidding war is on! Ultra Music Festival went from South Florida’s red-headed stepchild to the prettiest girl at the ball in pretty short order in the past few months. After Miami kicked Ultra out of Bayfront Park and then criticized its move to Virginia Key, many were shocked when Ultra said “enough is enough“. Many wondered what would happen, but some suspected Ultra was making a smart chess move. While a few months ago Ultra was being attacked from all sides, now the suitors are lining up. Ultra’s breakup letter to Miami gave Ultra the mojo to attract Homestead and its large Speedway, but also even Fort Lauderdale and now Miami Beach. Just hours after Miami held a Council meeting where it was decided they would re-engage with Ultra to try and bring the festival back to downtown Miami, Homestead held its own council meeting about Ultra. During that meeting Homestead approved a request from the Homestead-Miami Speedway to extend its operating hours and allow for a 10 year contract to lure Ultra. The speedway is owned by the city and currently closes at 11pm for events, but will now be able to stay open until 2am. Additionally, Homestead expects that around 40% of attendees would camp on site to reduce traffic issues, as happens during NASCAR races. Ultra actually has experience with camping from its Ultra Europe festival. Homestead required that any site plan would have to be approved by the city manager, all traffic plans would have to be approved by the police department, Ultra would have to indemnify Homestead should anything happen to anyone, and all insurance carriers would have to be approved by Homestead. Lastly, Ultra would have to agree to a $2 per day surcharge on ticket prices to go to the city. It would seem that right now Homestead is winning the  as it has seemingly the full authority it needs to close a deal. Now Miami Beach and Miami Proper will seek to give their representatives similar authority and Ultra will get to pick among the options. The tables have certainly turned for Ultra, who now has at least 3 municipalities fighting to win out as the festival’s new permanent home. Time is of the essence now as each knows Ultra wants to lock this down soon and that they face stiff competition.

And the production for the show was intricate and expensive. Alex revealed that when the tour started, they were $3 million in the hole, with no guarantee they could even make that up. So while they were touring, and killing themselves each night for these shows, they were also playing their DJ sets in Vegas to keep making money. They would literally leave the tour bus, fly to Vegas, play a show, then fly back for the next stop on the tour.A lot of people hate on The Chainsmokers, which is also addressed.

"This weekend was epic. EDC brought out the best in dance music with eclectic stages, surprise performances, and overall amazing energy. The festival attracted more than 150,000 people to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway from May 17th to 19th. Yet, there were a few bumps along the road. A few stages closed down on Saturday due to extreme winds, and, sadly, plenty of ravers were arrested. In addition to that, there were a few more negative moments. According to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, 65 arrests were made that weekend. Friday saw 25 arrests on felony charges. Then on Saturday, it declined to 14. Ten were felonies while the rest were misdemeanor arrests. To conclude the weekend there were 26 more ejected from the festival. Overall, these numbers are very similar to last year. In 2018, EDC saw about 66 arrests out of the 138,593 attendees. Besides, isn’t this an improvement? Sure, it’s only one less than the previous year but it’s still progress. Illegal stuff happens at festivals. It just does. To some, the risk of getting caught is a part of the experience. To others, not so much. The important thing is to not hurt people, which is what raves are all about. Have fun, but respect one another.

You get called the f*** out.With Kaskade playing a pool party set at Las Vegas’ latest superclub KAOS at The Palms, Deadmau5 (aka. Joel Zimmerman) was trying to catch a few Zzz’s.

While CLOUD will be an add-on service for Beatport’s loyal customers, Beatport LINK will allow DJs to integrate Beatport’s catalog into their DJ performance software. This comes after a year of speculation since Beatport had initially announced plans of a streaming catalog into DJ software at the Ibiza Music Summit in 2018.LINK will first come to Pioneer DJ’s WeDJ app, followed by Pioneer DJ’s own flagship Rekordbox DJ. Rekordbox DJ will bring the ability to access curated playlists, higher quality audio, and offline performance mode. No word on whether LINK will be coming to Traktor, Serato or other DJ performance software, however. Alternatively, CLOUD will bring a new set
of features for their “loyal customer base”. Such features will include an
unlimited re-downloads, a new My Library selection, and a Needle Drop player,

"The weird saga of the Woodstock 50 court battle is over, for now. The case deciding the future of the event concluded yesterday with justice Barry Ostrager ruling in favor of Woodstock. In other words, Dentsu, the main financier of the festival had no right to cancel the festival unilaterally. This means the festival can go on, obviously without Dentsu’s participation. However, that may be too big a hurdle to overcome.In a statement to Billboard, Woodstock lawyer Michael Kasowitz had this to say about the ruling in the court battle:That’s a pretty optimistic statement coming from the camp that just lost $20 million in a court battle. With a fast-approaching event date, it’s unclear if organizers would be able to pull this off. Besides the fact the festival is now essentially broke, there are loads of other obstacles in place too. Justice Ostrager’s ruling details many of them. “….” Although the Woodstock 50 court battle ended in victory for festival organizers, Dentsu may have come out on top. Clearly, the judge’s statement affirms much of what the Japanese organization is griping about. Woodstock now has to raise funding from scratch, secure artists, and install infrastructure. All of this needs to be done in three months time. On top of everything, organizers will have to convince attendees that they won’t be walking into a shit-show. With the mishaps and complications from festivals with much more time and organization, that may be the biggest obstacle. Not to mention, Fyre Festival is still fresh on the minds of many.Another thing to consider is that the Woodstock 50 court battle may actually not be over. If organizers can’t secure new funding, they may attempt to sue Dentsu to get back the $20 million. The judge did rule that Dentsu always had the right to control its share of the funds. However, the contract seems to open the door for breach of contract litigation galore. Though not very plausible, as it would delay Woodstock’s preparations even longer, it is an option. We’ll have to wait and see what tricks Michael Lang and Woodstock have left up their sleeves. With just t-minus 90 days until the show, we shouldn’t have to wait long.

"In a turn of events, Miami Beach Commissioner Ricky Arriola wants the City to consider hosting next years Ultra Music Festival in March 2020 as an alternative to Spring Break. For the past two years, City officials & residents have been talking about changing the image of the month of March which has been largely ruined by ‘Spring Breakers’. Similar efforts have proved successful at changing the tone of Memorial Day Weekend. Commissioner Arriola has placed a discussion item (Which you can view here) on the agenda for next week’s Commission meeting (22nd May 5 pm) to authorize discussions with Ultra’s organizers.Ultra, a while ago announced it was leaving the City of Miami after nearly two decades there. In their statement, they said that they were voluntarily terminating Ultra’s contract with the city, citing the “festival experience on Virginia Key was simply not good enough.”. After this, they supposedly had been in discussions with Homestead about a possible move there. But the festival organizers indicated a willingness to talk with Miami Beach after being approached by community leaders.In his memo to the Commissioners, Arriola wrote, Miami Beach over the past few years has been having a bit of a problem with rowdy spring breakers disrupting the general peace of everyone living there. Residents & Business owners alike have been complaining about spring breakers misbehaving & causing general chaos. Commissioner Arriola sees Ultra Music Festival as the perfect way to mitigate their problem. One single large event in one place makes it more manageable for everyone & that’s not even considering the revenue stream Ultra would bring to Miami Beach.Mike Palma, Chair of the Ocean Drive also noted that the Ultra’s organizers are experienced and have a “good security plan.” While the festival is a weekend-long event, the necessary setup and break down time would give the City of Miami Beach during the month of March.John Deutzman, the co-founder of the Miami Beach Crime Prevention and Awareness Group, is another strong proponent of the idea.

As a result, the club will be closed to the public until the next night. Wouldn’t it be nice if every employer had one of these parties? With over 2,000 people arriving to the island, 15 hotels have apparently been filled to capacity. As far as performers go, reports say that Jenifer Lopez is the only confirmed artists for now.

The city of Miami ‘denied’ UMF from returning to Bayfront Park and to find a new solution. The new Virginia Key location was not for everyone and had its issues. However, Ultra did the best it could in that time frame and many Miami officials are realizing that. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez stated early Thursday morning that he and others recognize all that the festival does, and can do, for the city.“The Ultra festival brings in a global clientele that will stay in our hotels, spend money locally, support local businesses,” he explained. “The international cache of Ultra is far better than the public embarrassment that we suffered over this spring break and last year’s spring break. It puts the city in a better light.”Ultra Music Festival brings in large amounts of revenue to the city of Miami. From hotels, to restaurants, and everything in between, Miami in many ways needs Ultra. It wasn’t long ago that Ultra was scheduled for two weekends in 2013 to counter the debt accrued from the new Marlins stadium.

We all remember peppy electro stylings of Fedde Le Grand right? His house number is still ringing in our ears. The Dutch Dj/producer is back with his new single ‘Like We Do’ on Darklight Recordings. We think it could easily become a summer anthem for 2019. The video barely gives it away.‘Like We Do’ is a slippy electro-house tune that’ll get you humming along and tapping your foot to it. It is much like any other exciting track from the producer that falls under the umbrella of this sub genre of house music. The tension rises and falls with a signature Fedde Le Grand drop as the bassline becomes heavier and the song glides through like a seamless tune. The digitized vocals add a futuristic touch to the track and may remotely remind some of the vocals used by Daft Punk back in the day. Fedde has been a constant in the house music charts around the globe. We think his fans will enjoy his latest work. Listen to the track below and let us know what you think.

"In the ongoing debate on whether cell phones should be allowed on the dance floor, one festival has taken an extreme stand against your mobile devices. The FLY Open Air Festival which is taking place this weekend in Edinburgh UK, has placed a ban on cell phones from its Boiler Room Stage. Attendees will not be able to use their devices while in the venue. While many people believe it should be up to the individual on whether they want to use their phones, others think it’s a total distractment. Seeing hundreds of phones up in the air, all recording and taking photos can dampen the mood in any environment. On the other hand, recordings and photographs taken at an event, offers the ability to relive the moment. All in all, FLY Open Air’s goal is to have attendees be in the moment.Those attending the two day festival this year, will have to abide by the ban when entering the Boiler Room venue. Before entering the stage, attendees will be handed a Yondr phone case. The case will secure their phone, making it unaccessible until they tap the case on a device when leaving. It’s an interesting design but opens up the concern for safety if there were ever an emergency. The locked cases would make it impossible to call for help if there were ever an emergency in the venue.All in all, if festival-goers aren’t interested in locking their devices away, they can avoid the stage entirely. If all goes well, it’s possible that the ban could extend to more than just one stage next year. We’re sure some will even attempt to sneak their phones in without locking them in the provided cases as well. Let us know if you are for or against the ban of cell phones from music events.

"Well, well well. It appears Miami and Ultra Music Festival aren’t completely done with each other yet. As we posited before, it’s entirely possible that Ultra’s highly publicized breakup letter with the City of Miami was a case of Art of the Deal. Rather than let Miami dictate all of the terms and continue to treat Ultra so harshly, Ultra snatched the upper hand by making a big splash in cancelling the deal. After the massive outcry from fans and the business community, perhaps Miami might be rethinking their moves after realizing how much money they stand to lose. On Tuesday, Miami’s website posted notice of a Sunshine Meeting for May 21 between 2 or more City Commissioners regarding Ultra Music Festival and City Bond Issues. It’s unclear at this point whether any representatives from Ultra will be in attendance or what this meeting is actually about. While it might be to discuss a new deal, it might very well just be a meeting to discuss issues raised in the previous meeting. There was discussion concerning the money paid by Ultra for the 2018 Edition and how it was to be used by the City to fund projects on Virginia Key or elsewhere. There was also discussion concerning how to fund the African American History Museum project without Ultra, so perhaps it relates to that.

Thanks to videos of EDC Japan attendees we were able to listen to the remix. The track starts out the same but has a completely different buildup. The drop takes all the similar sounds from the track but adds Tiesto’s signature sound on top. One of the biggest questions coming into the festival season is who will be playing Avicii’s album?

"Hot Since 82 is no stranger to BBC Radio 1. This time, he returns with yet another essential mix for your listening pleasure. The house music producer from the United Kingdom is based in Leeds. Since the rise of his moniker in 2012, he’s had quite an eventful career. Throughout his discography, you can see he’s had a rather obscure come-up. His first essential mix debuted with Pete Tong back in 2013, playing for 2 hours. This further propelled his career, allowing him to perform and collaborate with a larger number of acts. These acts include Green Velvet, Rudimental, and Shadow Child. This all cultivated into the release of his ‘‘ album, along with launching the Knee Deep in Sound record label.In this iteration of BBC Radio 1’s mix, he kicks it off with Benoit & Sergio‘s ‘The Way You Get‘.

"More than 60 festivals across the UK are banding together to help put a stop to single-use tents. The group is also urging major retailers like Argos and Tesco to stop marketing such items.According to a report it’s estimated that around 250,000 tents are left at festivals across the UK each year, this amounts to approximately 900 tons of plastic waste every festival season. If people were donating them to charities it would be one thing, but the reality is most of these barely-used tents go straight to the dumps.The Association of Independent Festivals (AIF) speaks on behalf of festivals like Shambala, Boomtown Fair and Boardmasters. All of which support the initiative to stop single-use tents and reduce plastic waste.In 2018, these music festivals pledged to cut down on plastic at events. This resulted in a drastic cut to single-use items like plastic straws, drink cups and more. A glitter ban was also instated across the 60+ festivals.CEO of the AIF Paul Reed speaking about this said: “We call upon major retailers to stop marketing and selling tents and other camping items as essentially single-use, and profiting from disposable culture.”“The message here is not ‘buy a more expensive tent’… festival audiences can take positive action and reduce their carbon footprint simply by taking their tent home and reusing it, ensuring that it doesn’t become a single-use item this summer.”Over in the states, Electric Forest is making an effort towards reducing their carbon footprint with eco-friendly tents. Their option is a rather pricey one though. But hopefully, in the future, we’ll see more options for affordable eco-tents.So if you are buying a tent for a music festival, please use it until it wears out or just donate it if you don’t need it anymore. Tents most definitely aren’t trash to leave behind.",articles11,"['Shambala', 'Electric Forest']"
"In the past few years, Michael Thivaios aka Dimitri Vegas has been stepping out of his musical comfort zone and growing himself into an actor. Late last year, we reported that the Belgian-Greek DJ was gearing up to voice Peter Parker‘s character in the Dutch version of Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse film.In fact, that was only the beginning. For example, he has also appeared alongside the legendary Jean-Claude Van Damme in Lukas and was featured in the popular film Patser.Recently, the talented producer has announced that he will be making his American-film debut in the new and highly anticipated Rambo V film.There have been speculations stating that this new Sylvester Stallone action movie will be the last of the beloved series and with Adrian Grunberg directing the fifth film in the franchise, fans can expect to be completely blown away, once again.Rambo will be taking on one of his most difficult adventures to date; his friend’s daughter has been kidnapped by a Mexican cartel. We absolutely can’t wait to see Dimitri Vegas in action, pun intended, when the film hits theaters worldwide on September 20, 2019. ",articles11,['Dimitri Vegas']
"Between gold cart joyrides, true and false shooting, cancellations, and arrests Rolling Loud certainly outdid Ultra this year. Nothing went right for the festival as issues seemed to continuously pile up. The Hip-Hop festival takes place at one of the venues many Ultra fans think would be a decent home for Ultra. First of all, Kodak Black was arrested at the Hard Rock Stadium Saturday on Federal and State weapon charges. The rapper was unable to perform and the mistrust with security only got worse. Lil Wayne canceled his performance at the festival after refusing a security pat down since he too was probably packing illegal heat.To all my fans who came to see me at Rolling Loud, I’m sorry but I won’t be performing. The Festival Police (Not Rolling Loud) made it mandatory that I had to be policed and checked to get on the stadium grounds. I do not and will not ever settle for being policed to do my jobWayne noted that “I do not and will not ever settle for being policed to do my job and give you guys a great show.” Incredibly, the issues don’t stop there. At one of the stages, a group of guys stole a golf cart and drove it through the crowd to get front row. Chaos at @rollingloud. Golf cart stolen and driven through the crowd pic.twitter.com/nH83wMip6zCrowd hysteria only got worse at Rolling Loud.

"Rolling Stone Magazine is a bit of a mess right now. One week ago they cut ties with Chief Revenue Officer Andrew Budkofsky after only a year. Today, we learned that their highly anticipated and heavily publicized charts release has been delayed. This release is supposed to be a direct competitor to Billboard’s Nielsen Music charts.Their PR firm Scoop Marketing made the news public. While anticipation is running high, they simply don’t feel prepared to unveil the final product. Part of the press e-mail addressed the timeline concerns and beta testing: “While we had initially targeted a public beta launch of May 13th, we are instead going to remain in private beta to optimize with our industry partners and fully ensure the smoothness of our presentation.”Typically this wouldn’t be a huge concern, as this happens to companies all the time. However, amid the turmoil surrounding Budkofsky’s exit, speculations are now running rampant in a negative fashion. As little back as last week at the Music Biz conference in Nashville, they were singing praises of the chart launch.Rolling Stone’s chart release is being spearheaded by ‘Alpha Data,’ formerly called BuzzAngle. They hope to compete directly with Billboard for chart supremacy, but their tenure is off to a rocky start. In yet another odd tidbit, Alpha/BuzzAngle founder Jim Lidestri told Digital Music News that he “wasn’t in the loop” on the Budkofsky situation.The last official word is that they “will be announcing a new launch date shortly.” Time will tell, but it is indeed a curious turn of events for the music industry giant.",articles11,"['Budkofsky’s', 'Rolling Stone’s', 'Alpha Data', 'Jim Lidestri']"
"August 16th is approaching and we still don’t know if Woodstock 50 is happening. Founder, Michael Lang, has insisted the show will go on. But as things started to fall apart, the festival’s investors, Dentsu and Superfly, pulled out altogether. Now there’s a battle going on between Dentsu and Lang, who filed for an injunction in order to retrieve the (nearly) 18 million dollars. Dentsu’s lawyer retaliated in a strong-worded statement:  ” But Woodstock 50 LLC’s and Michael Lang’s misrepresentations, incompetence, and contractual breaches have made it impossible to produce a high-quality event that is safe and secure for concertgoers, artists, and staff. The production company has quit, no permits have been issued, necessary roadwork has not begun, and there is no prospect for sufficient financing. As much as the parties might wish it otherwise, the festival contemplated by their agreement cannot happen and allowing it to go forward would only put the public at risk. The injunction sought by W50, even if there were a legal basis for it, cannot change that.”  —  Marc L. Greenwald, attorney for Dentsu Inc. According to Billboard’s sources, Lang had been planning this festival since 2014. Many of his colleagues tried telling him to scale back his plans. They believed that converting Watkins Glenn International Speedway into a camping festival would be a mistake. There were other variables that became red flags for the investors. Initially, Lang set the attendance to 150,000 people, which exceeds Coachella’s 125,000. Lang attempted to compromise for 100,000, but Superfly denied that motion. 75,000 was the best they could do to follow safety guidelines. The stark drop meant that Woodstock 50’s prices would skyrocket. This altercation between Lang and his investors demonstrate the sharp change between executing a festival in 69′ versus now. Lang held on to the belief that nostalgia from an older generation would be enough to drive sales for a festival that has been shoddy from the start. He’s trying to encapsulate the grit and grassroots movement the original festival had, and though it is an honorable effort, times have changed. The concept of a festival — the execution — can no longer be as free-spirited and wild. There are rules that need to be followed, money that needs to be allocated wisely, and star power above all else. The event is planned to take place in under 100 days. Tickets have yet to go on sale, and without Dentsu’s $18 million dollars, Woodstock 50 is running out of time. ",articles11,"['But Woodstock 50', 'Michael Lang', 'Woodstock 50']"

"It’s been nearly two years since Kaskade released Redux 002. But after patiently waiting, the wait is finally over! On Friday he finally delivered the long-awaited Redux 003 and initial reviews suggest it was worth the wait. The 18 track effort includes features from big names like Felix Cartal, Lokii, BROHUG, and Gorgon City. That’s quite a roster of artists so it’s understandable why so much time has passed between volumes. With this, you can tell Kaskade took his time to craft a great EP.Kaskade’s may have taken a while to drop but the EP still generated headlines. Back in January, some fans’ feathers were ruffled hearing no tour will accompany the album. Then, in an interview, he detailed plans to take the Redux Tour back on the road, saying this:Kaskade definitely dabbles in numerous genres on Redux 003. He touches the house, future, pop, and electronica genres on the album but the variety doesn’t interrupt the album’s cohesion. ‘Valentine‘ has a brooding vocal over a crisp bassline that is sure to be a pop-lovesong anthem of 2019. Then on ‘Fun‘, he goes subterranean with a heavy bass kick and a grimy synth. The BROHUG influence can definitely be felt on the track too. Overall the whole album makes for a great listen.

"Today marks the release of ‘Tough Love’, the 2 single released from Avicii‘s posthumous album . ‘Tough Love’ has been composed with Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir better known as Vargas & Lagola and joining the vocals for the track as a duet is Pontare’s wife Agnes (which was highly supported by Chris Martin from Coldplay).  These 3 have worked on multiple very successful Avicii songs in the past such as ‘Silhouettes’, ‘Hey Brother’, ‘Friend of Mine‘ and ‘Without You’. So yet again, we are expecting greatness just like the songs of old.‘Tough Love’ has been said to have been around 80% complete at the unfortunate time of Tim’s death back in April 2018.  We’ve always known Avicii to venture out into new genres and stay one step ahead of the times just like he did with ‘Wake Me Up‘ back in 2013.  Pontare and Al Fakir continued those ways with ‘Tough Love’ by preserving the oriental-influenced melody that Avicii created when the demo was first presented to him.  Again this is a completely different sound than we’ve ever heard from Avicii before.  ‘Tough Love’ is truly a melodic masterpiece that yet again envisioned was way before it’s time.The full album  is set to release on the 6th of June. We are even more anxious now to hear the rest of the album and wish early June could be here tomorrow! All net proceeds from the album sales will be donated to the Tim Bergling Foundation. The foundation’s initial focus will be on offering support to individuals and organizations within the field of mental health and suicide prevention, as well as secondarily expanding to cover other issues such as climate change, nature conservation and the protection of endangered species.Check out Avicii’s ‘Tough Love’ featuring Vargas & Lagola & Agnes below!",articles11,"['Vincent Pontare', 'Coldplay', 'Tim’s']"

"Apparently, revenue from Ultra Music Festival set aside for a Virginia Key museum is in jeopardy. The museum, in the midst of construction delays since 2005, is now seeing new setbacks. Lack of funding is currently stalling the project so Ultra’s Virginia Key arrival must’ve been seen as a godsend. Even Miami’s mayor Xavier Suarez seemed to express the project’s importance. However, it seems not too much consideration for its importance is taking place as UMF struggles to find it’s new home. Local Virginia Key official Gary Forchion said he’d be reviewing the effects of Ultra’s departure. He had this to say about alternatives for the future of the museum:I can say that the Trust is appreciative of the resources that were generated from the 2019 Music Festival for the Trust’s Civil Rights Museum Project but is turning its attention to gaining City’s approval of the Trust’s General Obligation Bond (GOB) resolution set for Mid-June around June 13th. Ironically, a museum honoring the historic suppression of African-Americans continues to take a backseat to other issues. Thus, it’s hard to understand why the city would risk the departure of the main source of its funding. Especially since they deem the project, “The single-most important art project in the county.” What’s even  ironic is what lawyer David Winker, is saying about the situation:… It is also a terrible result for the African American Museum at Historic Virginia Key Beach Park, which should have been opened a long time ago and is in desperate need of the funding ULTRA was providing as part of its arrangement with the City.Wow! He sues to stop Ultra then says the city sucks for making it leave. Mind-boggling.It’s been an interesting year for Ultra and its departure is just another chapter in the saga. How this will continue to affect the local businesses remains to be seen. Hopefully, the city of Miami can follow through on its promises and support important projects and businesses in the area.

"I can’t believe we’re here again but here we are. Back in August 2018 we asked the same question, as Ultra Music Festival was kicked out of Bayfront Park by the Miami City Commission. After so much time went into planning the move to Virginia Key, the powers that be were still hell bent on getting Ultra out of their respective backyards. Now Ultra is taking its ball and leaving Miami proper completely. No use second guessing it or saying it should go back to Bayfront. Let’s get real – where does Ultra go now?In branding you want your company to be unique and memorable with a few standout characteristics. In the world of top tier EDC festivals, EDC Vegas is the parking lot festival without an urban setting but lots of space, costumes, PLUR themes, relative proximity to Vegas hotels/clubs and now camping. Tomorrowland is the whimsical park festival with picturesque lakes, countryside hills, plenty of space, and lots of well-curated stages. Ultra Music Festival is the one with the cutting edge dance music lineup, an urban setting with gleaming glass buildings in view, close proximity to blue water, close proximity to hotels and transportation, and also Miami Music Week parties that go all night. With this in mind, Ultra has always wanted to keep this formula intact. That’s why Virginia Key was chosen over the oft-mentioned Homestead Speedway.We know Ultra plans to leave the City of Miami behind, but that is not all of Miami. It intends on choosing a South Florida location, so Orlando/Tampa/Daytona are all out. What are the options?The first place you would look is only a 20-30 minute drive away from Bayfront Park. Miami Gardens hosts the Hard Rock Stadium where you’ll find the Dolphins football team playing. It was recently renovated, and as you can see it can hold large music events. The venue has also hosted Life in Color Festival and Rolling Loud Festival in the past, however these events were in the surrounding parking lot. The idea of Ultra Miami becoming a parking lot festival seems unthinkable.On top of that, there’s a practical problem. The Miami Open Tennis Tournament is scheduled for March 23 to April 15 2020 and the venue will host the Super Bowl in February 2020. That being said, Ultra has not pegged any dates besides March 2020 so anything is possible. However, this is one of the only venues big enough and close enough to Miami’s nightclubs and hotels to keep a large portion of the Ultra vibe we know and love.Since we already know the Hard Rock Stadium is probably not available, the next best place to host a music festival is a Nascar speedway. The Miami Herald seems to think Ultra is in talks with the Speedway already, but nothing is in stone at this point. EDC Vegas thrives at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and we’ve seen festivals like HARD Summer and Imagine Music Festival move to speedways. The advantages are obvious – there is AMPLE space for activities. Bayfront Park is 32 acres, while the Homestead-Miami Speedway is 600 acres.While Homestead is a 30-40 minute drive south of Bayfront Park, it is surprisingly remote and hotels are scarce. It would have to be a camping festival of some kind, and Ultra is not in the business of running a camping festival. When you consider the unique characteristics of Ultra – this location loses basically all of them except for the lineup. Let’s hope this is not the choice and Ultra doesn’t become another EDC.South Florida includes Ft. Lauderdale and it too has some nice ocean-view parks. In fact, this particular park already hosts the Tortuga Music Festival only a few weeks after Ultra. Tortuga Music Festival hosts 100,000 people over its weekend in March. However Tortuga only hosts 3 stages compared to Ultra’s 7. It would be a nice venue and Ultra did get its start on the beach.Blue water? Check. Close proximity to hotels, transport? Check. Space? 99 acres – check. Haulover Park would be a perfect venue in North Miami Beach, but has some of the same issues as Virginia Key. Namely snooty residents and limited access/parking. In 2012, Swedish House Mafia attempted to host Masquerade Motel there and the permit was denied by Miami Date County due to “several logistical requirements that could not be resolved/satisfied to the level required” by the County. It might keep most of what we love about Ultra, but it might be too big of a lift at this point.Tropical Park is a bit of a jog west, but it’s got 275 acres of space and it’s got nice lakes surrounding it as well. It even has a stadium on the property that is normally used for track & field events. It certainly has enough space and is tucked far enough away that it won’t annoy people, but obviously it would be similar to Homestead Speedway in terms of losing the Ultra magic.Over the past 2 years Miami extracted a devil’s ransom out of Ultra to keep it at Bayfront before reneging on that deal. Then Miami suggested Ultra move to Virginia Key at another sky high price before seemingly pulling most of its support. Ultra made a big splash today by pulling the rug out from the City of Miami ahead of the Thursday meeting. Where the Commissioners were expecting Ultra to come and beg once more, Ultra told them to shove it. Ultra takes with it millions in annual revenue and possibly affects Miami Music Week as well. Who’s going to pay for that African-American History Museum now? Who’s going to pay for that Miami Marine Stadium renovation? Whoops. Miami stands to lose $2 million a year plus all of the additional economic benefits.Perhaps this is all a big walk-a-way to get Miami to beg Ultra back to the table. Perhaps Miami will feel the heat from the hotels, restaurants, rental companies, and clubs that stand to lose huge sums of money now. This might give Ultra some leverage with the City to come to a better arrangement for Virgnia Key or maybe even Bayfront.One Facebook user “in the know” has reported that Ultra’s new venue is “amazing” and “in the center of everything”. Reportedly three finalists were selected and the chosen venue is the best of the three, but nothing additional is known at this time. Could it be something we’ve missed?",articles11,"['Bayfront Park', 'PLUR', 'Daytona', 'The Miami Open Tennis Tournament', 'Miami’s', 'AMPLE', 'Bayfront Park', '600', 'Virginia Key', 'Namely', 'Virginia Key', 'Thursday']"
"In a move to spread awareness of our planet, the Glastonbury Festival is planning a special stage design for this year’s event. The iconic Gas Tower stage will be transformed and built from the ground up with recycled plastic.As you may know, the festival has already made a ban on the sale of plastic bottles this year and is looking for ways to be earth friendly as possible. The stage itself is rather complex, consisting of 8 HD screens that surround festivalgoers with a 360-degree view.“we are showing the world that the plastic we no longer want or need can be recycled”Considering the stage itself is fairly large, it is reported that 10 tons of plastic will be required for the build. A majority of the plastic will be collected in Cornwall, Somerset, and Devon, along with several beach cleanup events. The first beach cleanup event will take place May 11. Those that plan on attending the festival, are encouraged to take part in one of the events! Several more cleanup dates will be added and found on their website here.Once enough plastic is collected, it will be organized before being processed into stage materials. This project might be more complex than using standard materials, but the goal is to bring awareness of our planet.This entire project wouldn’t exist without the work from leaders Keep Britain Tidy and the Orca Sound Project. Additionally, it wouldn’t be possible for those collecting the recycled materials as well.  Allison Ogden-Newton of  described it as a great way to remove plastic from our environment, all while showing what can be produced with recycled material.We can’t wait to see how the finished stage turns out and hope to see similar projects in the future!",articles11,"['“we', 'Devon', 'Those']"

"Around 30 people at Teknival in the Creuse region of France, were treated for hypothermia after severe weather rolled in. The techno festival attracted about 10,000 people, most of whom did not bring acceptable clothing for such weather. On Saturday night, the temperature plunged to a freezing -3C (27F). Additionally, heavy snow blanketed the area, making rescue attempts even more challenging.Attendees were not expecting such extreme weather, as the temperature this time of year stays around 12C (53.6F). Luckily, the Red Cross was able to perform aide on the hill but two attendees had to be taken to the hospital. With people not dressed for the extreme temperatures, they were highly susceptible to hypothermia. If responders had not arrived with blankets and a heated tent, several lives could have been lost.To make matters worse, the event – which took place on top of a military-owned hill – was unauthorized. The location of Teknival changes each year, with many of the past locations held on private property as well. In fact, it’s reported that French authorities were working to prevent this years festival from taking place. Several trucks transporting sound equipment were supposedly stopped from entering the site just days before the event.Now that everyone has been successfully rescued, the French military, who owns the property, has filed an official complaint. Honestly, the festival coordinators were lucky no one lost their life and that responders arrived as quickly as they had. We hope that everyone who was affected makes a quick and full recovery.",articles11,['Luckily']
"Now before you start packing, what does this actually mean? The dicriminalize psilocybin ballot measure won’t change much with regard to producing, selling and distributing the drug. In other words, shrooms are still not legal and law enforcement will still pursue ‘dealers’ like usual. Remember, the drug still remains illegal under Colorado and federal law, listed as a schedule 1 drug. However, as an adult at least 21 years of age in the city, possession or usage of the drug is now the lowest priority for Denver law enforcement. We did it! Additionally, a panel will be created to assess the affects of the ballot measure no later than 2021.What’s also of note here are the implications for the scientific community. Research has begun to show promise through the use of psychedelics. It’s likely what’s giving the decriminalize psilocybin movement the biggest push. Recent studies are showing the potential to combat brain disorders and many more studies like it can now begin, as a result. This is fantastic news for those who are suffering from anxiety and depression. Now, patients can participate in these studies without fear of legal action from local authorities. Moreover, doctors can conduct their studies knowing their patients will reap the benefits of their breakthroughs.Once again, Denver is at the forefront of drug policy reform. Thus, one has to wonder how this will effect drug reform in other parts of the country. As with the marijuana movement the voters of Colorado have sparked a debate about drug laws and the possible benefits of recreational drugs. All but 13 states now have some form of marijuana reform on their books. Consequently, numerous studies leading to various health products have been created. Hopefully, the decriminalize psilocybin movement will have the same outcome for the patients and the party people alike.",articles11,"['Recent', 'Moreover', 'Denver']"

A few days ago, Michael Lang, one of the original organizers of the 1969 festival and lead promoter of Woodstock 50, came forward to accuse Dentsu Aegis Network of draining $17 million from the festival’s bank account.According to court documents, Woodstock 50 claims that Dentsu has caused enormous and irreparable harm and has demonstrated outrageous and illegal misconduct.“In a series of precipitous, underhanded and unauthorized actions, Dentsu purported to seize control of and oust W50 from the Festival’s production, and then immediately announced through press releases to the world on April 29 that it was unilaterally canceling the Festival.” – Woodstock 50Lang also claims that the investor prematurely cancelled the festival and tried persuading artists to cancel on their engagement to perform at the festival, “falsely telling them that they were released from their contracts with W50 and the festival, and that the performers should not perform at the Festival, though they have all been paid in full.”Despite all that is going on, Woodstock 50 insists they plan to follow through with the festival as scheduled.

"In a Game of Thrones level twist, Ultra Music Festival has cancelled its license agreement with the City of Miami to hold the festival at Virginia Key in 2020. As the City of Miami planned to vote on renewing the agreement tomorrow, Ultra is pulling the rug out from all of them.Ultra posted a long statement explaining the move. Citing feedback from its user surveys, Ultra teased its next move:“We are now finalizing new South Florida location that will service as an incredible an permanent home for Ultra Music Festival”Ultra said that while many amazing venues have been offered over the years, one has “shined far above the others” and Ultra plans to make it a permanent home.It’s a bit of poetic justice for Miami and the local groups who were all lining up to stab Ultra in the back after it brought the city millions of dollars every year. The City Commission was closely split on renewing the deal, despite the support of many hotel and restaurant groups. As it was Miami was extracting a sky high price to host the festival and expecting Ultra to obtain absolute perfection without its support.

"Festivals attract all sorts of people. The carefree and the careful, the wild and the reckless, the young  the old. Well, back in August, two metalheads snuck out of their retirement home just so they could attend Wacken Open Air, the world’s largest outdoor heavy metal music festival. Unfortunately, their party quest was cut short when police were notified of the two missing seniors.The German music festival lasts four days and on average, expects up to 75,000 attendees. Like most major music festivals, tickets sold out quick.  Since the men, one 58 and the other 59, didn’t have tickets to the festival, they were unable to gain access. Instead, they found their way to the German town of Wacken, located right outside of the festival. Now, we know what you’re thinking. 58? 59? That’s not that old. It’s true. What’s the harm?Sadly, the men suffered from mental health issues, so finding them became imperative for the police once they discovered the truth about their condition. In the meantime, the men enjoyed their time in the town. They drank and partied around, enjoying a moment of youthful nostalgia until it grew too late. Police said the men were drunk and disoriented when they found them. The men had missed the last bus and were wandering around the bus stop at 3 AM.From there, they were taken to the festival’s medical tent, where they sought medical attention while they waited for a taxi. At that point, these metalheads were ready to sleep and willingly accepted the police’s offer to escort them home.This is something you’d see in a show. A wilder , if you will. Yet the same lesson stands. You’re never too old to rage. Hell, when you’re older, there’s probably a better reason to do it.

"Drugs have been a part of mankind for thousands of years. There has actually been some evidence of the use of medicinal plants all the way back to 60,000 years ago. Recently archeologists discovered a 1,000-year-old Shaman’s Bag that contained Psychotropic drugs. Cocaine is an example of psychotropic drugs that were found in the pouch discovered in Bolivia. Anthropologist Jose Capriles had this to say about the discovery:“We already knew that psychotropics were important in the spiritual and religious activities of the societies of the south-central Andes, but we did not know that these people were using so many different compounds and possibly combining them together.”It was the largest number of psychoactive substances ever found in a single archaeological assemblage from South America. Throughout history, humans have used plant-based substances to alter perception, especially in religious or ritual contexts. The pouch was stitched together from three fox snouts. Inside were two wooden tablets for grinding psychotropic plants.Using a scalpel, the team of archeologists was able to take a small piece of the fox pouch and date it back 1,000 years. The findings indicated at least three plants were being used. There was also evidence of the use of psychedelic tea.“Chemical traces of bufotenine, dimethyltryptamine, harmine, and cocaine, including its degradation product benzoylecgonine, were identified,”It is impossible to gauge exactly how the plants were prepared. But they do almost 100% know it was a Shaman’s bag as they were the only people to know how to use drugs to connect to the spiritual world. This discovery shows the people in the region had an impressive knowledge of plants and their properties.The crazy part is none of the psychoactive compounds were indigenous to the area of the Andes they were discovered in. This indicated they were an elaborate amount of trading going on in order to obtain these plants. I guess people in the past are not so much different from us after all.",articles11,['Cocaine']

But, at the same time that would be feeding him cash and I don’t know if anyone is about that life anymore.  ",articles11,"['Billy’s', 'Billy’s', 'Billy’s', 'Trump’s', 'Andy King', 'Dennis Rodman']"
"Over the years Pioneer has cemented itself as the “Industry Standard” for DJ equipment. The company has faced little to no competition during all that time. However, according to Japanese financial websites, it seems Pioneer is getting out of the DJ business and selling off its DJ subcompany. Pioneer Corporation is not the same thing as Pioneer DJ, however. Pioneer DJ is a subsidiary of Pioneer.Pioneer previously sold over 85% of its DJ subsidiary to investment firm KKR & Co. in 2015. Now according to a report from Nikkei Business, both parties are now in talks to offload the entire stock to new buyers. The report further says bidding has already begun with an expected price between 60 billion to 70 billion yen, a figure well north of $500 million.Pioneer DJ, the subsidiary created during the original sale to KKR & Co., recorded sales of over $200 million in 2018 despite the parent company reporting net losses in 2016 and 2017. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Pioneer DJ controls between 60% and 70% of the global share in DJ mixers, turntables and other products.While its DJ equipment arm remains dominant, Pioneer is currently restructuring and was recently bailed out by Baring Private Equity Asia, a Hong Kong buyout firm. The bailout was reported to be around $930 million. The Japan Times reports that the deal involved laying off 3,000 employees — 15% of Pioneer’s total workforce.Despite trouble on the business sides of things, Pioneer DJ is still regularly releasing products. They dropped both the SQUID 16-track hardware sequencer and DDJ-800 controller in April alone. And their DJM mixers & CDJ2000 players remain a DJ booth standard.Resident Advisor",articles11,"['Pioneer', 'Pioneer', 'Pioneer', 'Pioneer', 'KKR & Co.', 'Pioneer', 'Pioneer']"
"Russian producer and DJ Artem Stoliarov or ARTY (also known as ALPHA 9) is taking international pop megastar Marshmello to federal court in the United States over copyright infringement. ARTY claims that Marshmello, Daniel Campbell Smith of Bastille and Steve Mac copied the remixed portion of ARTY’s take on OneRepublic‘s ‘I Lived’ for the chorus of the double-platinum track ‘Happier’ by Marshmello.Stoliarov’s attorney is none other than famed Nashville copyright attorney Richard Busch. Busch is known most recently for winning Marvin Gaye‘s lawsuit against Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams for ‘Blurred Lines’. The suit for Stoliarov claims damages for the infringement, and a detail of how much money the Marshmello song has actually made.“Arty claims out of the 20 notes, the order of the first 19 notes are identical. Arty says he and Marshmello are acquaintances and often perform at the same music festivals. [he] also claims Marshmello was at one of his shows and saw him perform his “I Lived” remix.” – TMZListening to the two tracks side by side makes it hard to ignore the similarities. Listen to the chorus of ‘I Lived’ first around 1:49, then listen to the chorus of ‘Happier’ at 0:49 played back at 1.25x playback speed.This controversy around Marshmello is tacking onto the recent lambasting he has taken in the media from CHVRCHES for collaborating with Chris Brown, fuelled further by Jai Wolf.",articles11,"['ARTY\xa0', 'Steve Mac\xa0', 'ARTY’s', 'Busch', 'Robin Thicke', 'Pharrell Williams', 'Blurred Lines’', 'Arty', 'Jai Wolf']"

ARTY is one of the most diverse producers in the industry. His tracks and remixes continue to wow crowds with a blend of uplifting sounds and bumping club beats. Earlier this year, he released ‘Save Me Tonight‘ which is already one of the biggest tracks of the year. His latest single ‘Avalanche‘, which is released under Armada Music last month, is another massive tune. And now we may be seeing an emotional remix from the Russian producer for Swedish House Mafia’s latest ID.ARTY took to Twitter this weekend to share his desire to remix the potentially named ‘Underneath It All‘ ID.«Underneath it all” ID by @swedishousemfia is one of the most beautiful written songs I’ve ever heard in my life. Those lyrics will be timeless. My dream would come true to do the remix for this song. Go, check it out on YouTube, cry it through, feel it through, its incredible— ARTY (@artymusic) May 5, 2019Who knows if it will come to pass but if it does it will be a feels trip.  Out of all the producers out there, I can’t think of a better producer than ARTY to remix the track. ARTY’s renditions always seem to add unique doses of euphoria while staying true to the original soundscape. The ID is already mesmerizing enough – this paired with ARTY’s uplifting style will sweep everyone off the dance floor.Embed YouTube Video  ",articles11,"['ARTY\xa0', 'Earlier', 'Those', 'ARTY’s', 'ARTY’s']"
"Earth Day has come and gone, but the efforts to be better to the environment have not stopped. Prague is joining the cause! As the first city to ban plasticware starting May 1, the city is tired of the significant amount of litter produced by society. They are pushing for a clean-up. The capital of the Czech Republic is testing an outlaw on plastic cups at music festivals. Hopefully, this corrects the severe trash problem.An official from City Hall stated that they would like Prague to become more environmentally friendly. Reducing the use of disposable plastics is a start, and the most effective means of fighting for clean oceans and nature. Given the picture above, I think we can all agree that cleaning up after a festival is no easy task.“I hope that Prague will not remain alone and inspire other organizers and operators,” Třeštíková, of city hallThere will be a ban on plastics including cups, food and beverage containers, and plastic cutlery (such as forks, spoons, and knives).While rap and pop music festivals are under fire at the moment, this law will monitor all genres. The most popular music genres can help push the green idea further as dedicated fans attend throughout the year. Even other artistic events are being asked to adhere to this new law. No plastics can be used while painting, acting, or dancing.There is some intent, but questionable foresight as city officials direct event organizers in using reusable resources. This includes glassware, porcelain, metal, or wooden items in place of plastics.The problem with this solution is tricky, though. Intoxication levels at such events vary, which brings up safety concerns with people having such items at their leisure.  Glassware and metals are particularly dangerous, if thrown or projected. While it is the thought that counts, this could present new welfare risks.In the words of Lil Dicky, “We love the Earth, it is our planet, it is our home.” Let’s follow Prague in saving our planet.",articles11,"['Earth Day', 'Lil Dicky']"
"Although psychedelics remain illegal in most developed nations, citizens are taking matters into their own hands. As an alternative to prescribed medications with various side-effects, some have experimented with mushrooms and LSD. On Friday, The Guardian published a story that detailed the experiences of women from various walks of life who’re suggesting microdosing may have positive outcomes. Apparently, small doses of the drugs (usually around 0.1g every few days) are diminishing the effects of depression and anxiety. One of the interviewees had this to say about the technique:The article goes on to stress differentiation between microdosing and recreational usage. The idea here is to increase productivity and focus. In other words, the goal is not to go on some mind-bending trip on your way to the grocery store. Ideally, you take just enough to alter your mood in a positive way without the known negatives of “coming down.” However encouraging The Guardian’s piece comes across, it stops short of suggesting anyone start their own grow operation. A quote from one of the ladies who  grow puts this into perspective:Decriminalizing psychedelics is a hot button issue lately. In fact, the city of Denver is set to vote on this very topic tomorrow. The major benefit though is that scientists are able to do their work. The microdosing article referenced an interesting study that centered on 98 test subjects. The study was fairly extensive as it covered, “1,792 daily reports including 489 reports of microdosing days.” Clearly, this type of research is very valuable when considering if these drugs are suitable for inclusion in potential treatments. Additionally, it supplements the long list of studies already supporting potential breakthroughs with brain disorders.Reporting in the New York Times details another study which supports the potential of microdosing as well. Conclusively, scientists from Johns Hopkins Univerity recommend the reclassification of psychedelics for medical use. That’s a substantial statement which should not be ignored if we’re serious about tackling the issues surrounding mental health.The main takeaway from stories like these is that there is a new frontier when it comes to brain research. Hopefully, all of the relaxed attitudes towards microdosing will result in quality research and scientific breakthroughs.

"On May 9 Ultra Music Festival‘s fate will once again fall into the hands of the Miami City Commission as it faces fierce opposition from a slew of local groups. The worst part about these proceedings is that while all of the opposition comes to the meetings to voice opposition, many of Ultra’s biggest supporters are physically unable to come. Whether by work or by location, most of the Ultra attendees cannot set aside an entire workday to show their support. So we decided to take a few perspectives from those who cannot be there, but wanted to make their support known.Dear Commissioners,You may not know it or you might not want to admit, but you are weighing the future of Miami’s single most iconic event. Miami is an amazing vibrant city with one of the most unique landscapes in America. What makes Miami iconic is the beautiful beaches, the crystal blue water, the gleaming glass buildings, and yes…being at the forefront of dance music in America. Let’s face it, Miami is not known for any of its sports teams at the moment. Miami doesn’t host the Oscars or the Golden Globes or anything like that, though it is hosting the next Super Bowl. Miami is known for hosting one of the most iconic music festivals in the world: Ultra. Studies have found that it is the most “life changing” festival since Woodstock.It’s the only music festival of its size and scale that is nestled within a metropolitan area while also being right alongside those gorgeous blue waters. The other largest music festivals are tucked far away on inland farms and parks far away from any blue water. Ultra Music Festival is a Miami institution and it is the pre-eminent music festival in the fastest growing area of music. It’s a multi-billion dollar industry that captivates that ever coveted 18-34 demographic. This is the music and the culture they grew up with and will always enjoy, and thanks to Ultra Miami is forever ingrained in their mind as a destination for their music.Music festivals of this scale and acclaim are celebrated in other host towns. Belgium’s Tomorrowland is so celebrated, it is practically the country’s unofficial team. The citizens fly Tomorrowland flags on their homes and brag about being home to such a legendary event. Las Vegas treats EDC Week as a holiday and rolls out the red carpet for the festival. Ultra Music Festival is just as iconic, and Miami would be foolish to toss it aside.Many of the arguments against Ultra center around how “dangerous” it can be, while completely ignoring the gargantuan task that Ultra Music Festival so successfully accomplishes every year. In fact, of the dance music festivals (or festivals in general) Ultra is one of the safest of them all. Ultra hosts somewhere around 165,000 attendees each year, and yet in 2018 there were only 28 arrests and less than 50 hospitalizations….out of 165,000 people! Sure Ultra had some tough times in 2014 and 2015, but it learned and adapted to become what it is today. What’s even more impressive is that even after years of experience at Bayfront, Ultra was moved to Virginia Key with hundreds of new variables to contend with and still maintained a stellar safety record.Ultra Miami 2018 Labeled As Safest Ultra Music Festival EverOther large festivals have much less impressive records of safety. EDC withholds medical call data from its official reports now. EDC had 1 death in 2017 and Tomorrowland had 2 in 2018, yet Ultra has had none in several years. You should be proud of the impressive record of your home festival.EDC Vegas Ends with 1000 Medical Calls & 1 DeathAll of this goes without saying that Ultra brings in almost $100 million to Miami annually. If Miami does not do right by Ultra, the fans of the festival will not soon forget it and will take their money elsewhere. Ultra has already been through a difficult year of change, and now is the time to rally behind the most iconic event in Miami. Do not reject the hundreds of thousands of Ultra fans by rejecting Ultra.Good afternoon,I am writing in regard to Ultra Music Festival. I am a 40 year old business owner that has recently discovered the city of Miami via UMF. I have attended Ultra for the past two years with a friend of mine. I frequently visit the Florida Keys however if it weren’t for Ultra (UMF) I would have never visited Miami. I have come to thoroughly enjoy Miami, it’s atmosphere, and it’s people. This would have never happened without UMF. Side note, while in Miami for Ultra, I spent thousands of dollars at local restaurants, hotels and clubs. So did my friend.While at the festival this year I had the chance to speak to some locals from Key Biscayne. They had mentioned talk of possibility for making the current UMF sight on Virginia Key into soccer fields. Not sure of there was any truth in that. But what an opportunity for Ultra and the city of Miami. Honestly the new location on Virginia Key was a bit tough. Bayfront Park, and the ambiance of the city is tough to beat. That being said. I believe with some improvements to the current location and the support from the city of Miami, you’ll keep thousands of people like myself coming back for their yearly fix of EDM.
I hope the city of Miami considers working with UMF instead of against. I have come to enjoy Miami immensely, however without UMF I fear I won’t be back.My husband and I have been at Ultra Miami for the past 6 years.
We stayed 2 times at downtown and the noise was not as loud as the commissioner Carollo mentioned. We never saw or listened windows shaking or something like that, even at the hotel that was 5 blocks away from Bayfront, and we never arrived early at Ultra so they were already playing when we were still at the hotel. The last 3 times we have stayed in Brickell and this year we could see the stages from the apartment but not listening noise at all, even when it was The Chainsmokers closure at Sunday (yes, we left early because the transportation issues).
We always stay more than a week enjoying the city, visiting other sites than just Ultra, spending a lot of money (fees and taxes are really high) but having the time of our lives because it’s Ultra and it’s Miami.
We heard a lot of positive comments from restaurants’ service people and lyft drivers because they were having a great income just for the weekend.
We would love to attend Ultra in Miami again and again so, you have our vote in favor too.To Whom it May Concern-
A small group of us traveled to Miami for this wonderful, peaceful event that you guys have been hosting for the past 2 decades. We enjoyed the city very much and would be more than happy to come back again. Of course the event had hiccups with limited amount of time to plan at this location but I do believe, as many do, that with some minor improvements these hiccups can be addressed in the years to come. As far as the sound complaints…. We traveled by Ferry boat and could not here any music until we near the venue so I would hope Miami and the sound consultants for Ultra can get some facts together and realize that this may not be an Ultra issue but an outside source. Hopefully Miami can and Ultra can still flourish from the floods of revenue this event brings in for everyone Miami is Ultra and Ultra is Miami. Let’s keep it that way.Thank You.Ill make this short and sweet.How long did ultra have to put this festival together this year……?Now compare it to other festivalsNow can you see how fast UMF can fix problems on the fly? By Sunday the festival was almost, if not perfect.33 noise complaints out of the thousands of people that live in the Brickell and Biscayne key area. That’s very low.Arrests were very low as well.Where were the complaints for the sea life at Bayfront? That location was also next to sea life.Basically Ultra went as smooth as it could with the timeframe it had. Now if the city commissioners give them a whole year like they should have had, then most of these problems will be solved.With that being said, I would like to point out that the ONLY reason we come to Miami is for UMF. My husband and I have spent over $50,000 in Miami over the last 8 years and we are there for Ultra weekend only (no other events). I would also like to point out that Ultra is an amazing festival and a lot safer then most. In 2018 EDCLV had 96 arrests over the 3 days and in 2017 EDCLV had 1090 medical calls (they did not report 2018 numbers). Ultra had 37 arrests over the 3 days and the festival had 281 medical calls, nowhere near the amount as EDCLV.Yes, the festival has a few things to work on but I know without a doubt they will make sure next year is flawless. Please don’t take away our “home” away from us, we love the city of Miami and UMF and we are willing to do whatever it takes to keep it in its rightful home.Thank you!A local said to me, “we don’t have industry in Miami, we have tourism”. If the city of Miami voted in favor of “kicking” Ultra out, this would cause more than a fracture to Miami’s identity.
If Ultra leaves, will Miami Music Week remain? What would stop the industry leaders from moving the other events, elsewhere?
If you eliminate a massive event like Ultra from a tourist city, you will create an economic “bust” with a basement so low, you can’t even see the impact.I think the city of Miami should focus on how they are spending the “tax-generated” money each year, and “spend” less time contemplating whether or not Ultra deserves its home, where it all began, over twenty years ago.",articles11,"['Ultra’s', 'Miami’s', 'Belgium’s Tomorrowland', 'Virginia Key', 'The Chainsmokers', 'We', '…', 'EDCLV', 'Thank', 'Miami’s']"

You might not have known this, but Grant Kwiecinski, aka GRiZ, is not only a talented artist but a philanthropist as well. He and Bob Hurley, the founder of the popular surf-brand company, collaborated in designing a custom-made surfboard along with twelve unique posters for charity. The items will be auctioned off through GRiZ’s Ride Waves Charity Raffle. The proceeds will benefit Seven Mile Music, an organization that supports music and art programs for kids in Detroit. On May 3rd, Hurley published a video showing the making of the surfboard on YouTube. In it, you can see the duo’s creative process and hear why GRiZ decided on this project.Back in 2012, the Detroit public school system slashed creative arts funding. As a kid, GRiZ was given a saxophone and learned to play while at middle school in Detroit. Now that this program is no longer an option for kids in this community, the It Gets Better producer has stepped in to help. Earlier this year he raised over $100,000 through his 2019 GRiZMAS event. Still, in his eyes, there is more work to be done.The raffle for the custom-made surfboard and twelve posters will be open until July 15th. Entries for the surfboard can only be done online (here). 3 runner-ups will receive between $25 to $50 gift cards to the GRiZ online merch store as well as a signed vinyl. The twelve posters, however, will be only be auctioned off in the Ride Waves Charity Raffle during GRiZ’s U.S. tour. They are limited-edition, hand-made prints unique to each city on the tour.You won’t want to miss this tour. It’s a win for everyone.",articles11,['GRiZ']

"Ever fallen asleep while listening to music? Ever then had your headphones fall off your ears? What if they fell off your ears and into your mouth? Which you then swallowed?!?! Well, thanks to some exhaustion and good (bad?) luck, Ben Hsu of Taiwan can now say yes to all these questions and live to tell the tale.Ben fell asleep while listening to music, and when he awoke, could not find his second Apple AirPod. He looked in his lap, under his blanket, all over – but no dice. Then, using his iPhone tracking feature, he kept hearing them beep – still nothing. Then he listened closer, and behold! The AirPod was inside his stomach!Ben quickly went to Kaohsiung Municipal United Hospital to have the issue remedied. They let him know that it was currently passing through his digestive system, saying it would need surgery to remove if it did not appear “naturally.”Easily enough, the doctors gave him a laxative. More difficult, though, was the fact he would have to sift through any “waste” to find them. Fortunately, the AirPod revealed itself when Ben relieved himself at a railway station just the next day. Amazingly, the battery life was still at 41%!Apple’s design team also breathed a sigh of relief. Had Ben been exposed to the battery, it could have caused serious damage to his intestines. Dr. Chen Chieh-fan explained: “Because of the plastic shell around the AirPod, the risk of it causing him harm in a similar way to swallowing a regular lithium-ion battery is much lower.”All’s well that ends well for Ben. Maybe he will be a bit more careful sleeping and listening to tunes.",articles11,"['–', '! The AirPod']"

"Swedish House Mafia just put on a monumental performance for fans in their native country of Sweden. It’s the first of a three-date stop in Stockholm that marks the beginning of their reunion tour. In October, tickets sold quickly following SHM’s confirmation of the dates. Finally, the day of the event is here and fans are reporting a truly rewarding experience for making their hasty investment. Thankfully, the fans are capturing the whole thing.The entire 90 minutes-plus recording of SHM’s first Stockholm show is here. Additionally, the video is shot from a decent enough vantage point that we can see the amazing lights display. It’s definitely something that should have everyone excited for what’s to come on future SHM dates. Besides that, the video was shot from far enough away that the sound quality isn’t compromised. As a result, we’re able to hear the music from the performance pretty clearly without much feedback from crowd noise. It’s great to hear some classics like the one at about 25:30 mixed in with some new material.Thank you. @swedishousemfia @Axwell @Ingrosso @SteveAngello ♥️♥️♥️ pic.twitter.com/BWZbDpPupy— pauline a.k.a JADE (@doenutt_) May 2, 2019Along with that here’s just a sampling of some of the great photos we’re starting to see:",articles11,['Thank']

She promoted that it isn’t right to promote domestic abuse or promote “serial convicted violence” to kids. In addition, she commented, “Now I’m gonna have to invest in some fucking bulletproof tutus because apparently, that does not go down well with the Breezy fans.”Mayberry revealed that due to the threats and hatred that she has received from fans of Chris Brown has taken a toll. In the tweets below, she writes about avoiding her own home and adding more security to their gigs for protection.I am not staying in my own home when we finish tour because the threats we have received have reached such a scale.

Damn, he  that. Thomas Wesley, aka Diplo, delivered another seamless cross-genre performance. He closed out the Palomino stage at Stagecoach Festival on Sunday, April 28th. Stagecoach is California’s premier country music fest. They typically feature artists like Luke Bryan, Brett Michaels (a name we haven’t heard in while), and this year they even had spiky-haired Guy Fieri take over the smokehouse. Basically, it’s the Coachella of country music.Compared to the rest of the lineup, Diplo’s performance definitely stood out. He included two Avicii songs, the classic country anthem , and, of course, his remix of the mega-hit . To be honest, the set isn’t bad. Even if you’re not a country fan, I think you can appreciate his ability to mix the two together.Not too long ago, Diplo announced that he was going to explore and produce more country music. This isn’t too surprising since he is known to jump into different genres, like hip hop, moombahton, pop, and more. Unlike those genres, which complement one another, country is another world. Minus Avicii’s ‘Hey Brother’there haven’t been many collaborations between the two. Still, listen to Diplo’s live performance and decide for yourself if this does or doesn’t work.

"The last time Calvin Harris released a new album was when he released the poppy ‘Funk Wav Bounces Volume 1.’ Since that, he has made a triumphant return to house-influenced singles but that’s about all we have heard. Leave it up to a Sony financial report to come through with some fresh gossip. According to its latest report, we should expect a brand new album from Calvin soon.The new Calvin Harris album shows up under the ‘Noteworthy Projects’ heading. Additionally, the fiscal quarter ending June 2019 is where the album reportedly falls. Along with a new Calvin album, Sony also lists new material from Chris Brown, Bruce Springsteen, DJ Khaled, Pink, and Tyler The Creator. Those are some pretty big names in the industry each sure to generate a buzz in their respective genres. Therefore, it’s easy to see why Sony would be listing these titles on their financial report. What’s not so obvious is why they would want to leak info about upcoming projects in this manner.What’s it’s important to note here is that for many of the albums, the financial report doesn’t list much info. No album name or release date can be seen. Albums that do have a title listed, like BTS‘, are actively being promoted. Sony definitely would be expected to report that to investors. However, for the nameless albums, this would have to be the most boring way to start a press run. Although, the report implies that Sony’s second quarter is generating revenue from the listed albums. Seemingly, those albums all but have to be released before the end of June.

"A 60-year-old woman from China takes “danced too hard” to a whole new level after her uterus slipped out of place and protruded out of her vagina. Dr. Song, a doctor from the city of Xuzhou, China, told news sources that the woman had sought medical attention after she felt something drop out of her body while dancing. A physical exam from her doctor found a total prolapsed uterus.If this sounds absolutely horrifying to you—relax a little. While the woman claims that she might have danced too hard, her treating physician explains a more physiological happenstance. For one, the woman reports having a history of uterine prolapse in the past. Although, previous incidences only involved slight protrusion in comparison to this episode’s entire prolapse.Uterine prolapse isn’t an uncommon issue. However, severity can vary. It is often caused by muscles surrounding and supporting the uterus weakened from childbirth. Dr. Song suspects that the patient may have given birth to a large baby in the past to predispose the condition. Additionally, older women, particular after the age of menopause, are more prone to uterine prolapse due to decreased estrogen levels that usually play a role in muscle and tissue tone.Not to fear—all hope is lost for aging women. Dr. Song advised new mothers to start exercising their pelvic floor muscles after giving birth to prevent such occurrences. She also urged women not to dismiss chronic constipation, coughs or allergic rhinitis untreated as their can all cause stress and weakening to the pelvic floor muscles overtime.Regardless, the woman underwent corrective surgery to secure her uterus back in place and is on the way to recovery. Glad to hear that she’s okay, and hopefully she gets to continue shuffling on soon.",articles11,[None]

And, that is why they can proudly proclaim that “Music Is Our Magic”.Cousins by blood, brothers in music, Lyonbrotherz are an electronic dance music (EDM) duo setting Germany alight with their passion for music and producing top tracks.Daniel and Keven Lyon have emerged from modest home lives in the heart of their country to set up their own label – League of Lyons – and craft Hip Hop and EDM tunes that see them on the verge of a breakout onto the international stage.With ‘World of Fire’ released this year, the pair has more tunes and projects waiting in the wings to be unleashed in 2017.It was the desire to be their own masters that saw Lyonbrotherz emerge… When they first started their career tentatively writing their own rap and hip hop lyrics over other musicians’ beats they discovered that they didn’t match their own vision.From that point on Daniel and Keven knew they had to carve out their own path, writing and producing their own beats. Such has been the success of the team in production that already other EDM and Hip Hop artists from across the globe are beating down the doors to get a taste of the Lyonbrotherz magic on their tracks.Drawing influences from the likes of KSHMR, Blasterjaxx, Avicii, Diplo, and Kanye West the musical duo absorb what they hear and interpret these with their own vibe and rhythms.The genesis of Lyonbrotherz came when Daniel was on one of the largest electronic music festival stages and came back enthused and energized. One conversation with Keven later and the duo were in business.Now with DJ duties, EDM and Hip Hop producing, and supporting others they are already looking to exploit every opportunity. After appearing in music videos they are contemplating future work acting.Early formative experiences meant that they knew nothing came for free; nothing can be achieved without hard work – an attitude, combined with their ability, that will see them scale the heights.You could say that what they have done is create their own genre within EDM – “O’n’B”, Oversea and Boom. And, one experience of Lyonbrotherz and you’ll feel the boom.Never giving up and never relenting they really epitomize their motto “Music Is Our Magic”One production has been picked up by an international fashion brand but it hasn’t always been an easy path. In their own words it is hard to stay focused and “work hard when all of our friends are out partying”.That and familial issues saw them take a brief break from behind the production desk and decks. But Daniel and Keven are closer than ever. Now they are back brimming with energy, belief and determination.

"Undisputed legends in the drum and bass scene, Calyx & Teebee return to the spotlight with a whole host of new material. And it’s been twelve months since they released “Intravenous,” and fans are ready for the next chapter. They have gone away and come back with a full series concept, which the duo has just announced. Plates will be a run of releases – using their respect for dub-plate culture as a basis for its artwork, visuals and music. Once the string of singles has landed, the whole Plates LP will be made available. It’s sure to be a big one! C&T get the
series off to a whopping start with “War Dub,” a cut that is going to create
carnage on a dance floor. Their signature production prowess shines through
from the get-go. Think drawling horns, chopped ragga vocals and a thunderous
bassline  – they hold nothing back here. And with the prospect of so much fresh material on the horizon, we’re stoked at this announcement. Putting forward their thoughts on the project, they state:“Having released 2 albums since we joined RAM Records, we’re excited to be starting our next chapter with them by launching a new series called ‘Plates.’ It takes us back to our DnB roots – both musically, and in terms of how the music disseminates to our peers, fans and ravers.” “War Dub” can be streamed on the link below, and keep up to date with Calyx and Teebee as the Plates series develops. To drum & bass fans the world over the names Calyx and TeeBee are synonymous with high quality, perfectly sculpted music. Just as Michelangelo discovered statues in blocks of stone, Calyx and TeeBee discovered the essence of D&B locked away in studio equipment; always forward-thinking and packed with as much integrity as energy; their music has had an impact on the scene for over fifteen years.So while Calyx & TeeBee’s first collaborations emerged in 2004, their history and friendship dates back to 1998. They were introduced as label-mates of the legendary Moving Shadow imprint. As a result, in the following years the two artists accumulated astounding solo back-catalogues of releases on a glittering array of D&B’s most respected labels.The pair ended an amazing year with an avalanche of wins at the most respected awards ceremony in drum & bass: The Drum&BassArenaAwards. Home to the most dedicated and discerning fans on the planet, the brand’s community voted its leading single ‘Elevate This Sound’ (the first track that Calyx ever recorded his own vocals on) for Best Single. And the second single ‘Pure Gold’ won Best Video. So it happened that the most coveted trophy possible – Best Producers – also landed at their feet. Adding to this gold-rush momentum, BBC Radio1 ’s shortlisted them for Top 5 best Essential Mixes of 2012 – a moment of scene history. It’s the first time a drum & bass artist’s Essential Mix has ever achieved such recognition. As ‘All Or Nothing’ continues to develop a life of its own, having spawned massive singles. ‘Strung Out’, ‘Elevate This Sound’, ‘Pure Gold’ and ‘Scavenger’ all featured. So they are to be found either deep in the studio, working on future releases or at the world’s most respected drum & bass events – massaging the masses with their intricate six-deck sermons.

"Even if you don’t listen to K-Pop music (yet!), I’m sure you’ve heard the name Blackpink, the all-female K-Pop act consisting of Jennie, Lisa, Rosé and Jisoo. They are currently extremely popular, not only in their country of South Korea but also all over the world. Actually, BTS and Blackpink are the only K-Pop acts on the World Digital Song Sales Chart. The K-Pop invasion has officially begun!DJ Tinc, the female DJ based in Singapore, took Blackpink‘s mega-hit “Ddu-du Ddu-du” and turned it into a serious Festival Trap anthem. The use of Blackpink‘s vocal is perfect, Tinc kept all the catchiness of the original and properly wrapped it around a fresh and satisfying out-of-control bass-heavy EDM Trap sound. The build-ups are tight, the melodic arrangements are infectious, the drops are absolutely intoxicating and the remix overall really brings a finely-calibrated epic flavor to the EDM genre.The remix is versatile and relentless, it will kill it as much in clubs as in music festivals. Tinc delivered two different drops, going for a Trapstep feel in the first one and giving her crowd an unexpected and powerful 4×4 drop to end things on a high energy note.If you miss the good old hands up in the air EDM/Festival Trap sound, DJ Tinc is a DJ/producer that you should follow closely. She brings some real party music!More about DJ Tinc:TINC is an experienced female DJ based in Singapore. She specializes in hardstyle, bass trap, trance, and live open-format DJing.Over the years, she has performed in countless festivals & clubs both local and abroad. TINC has DJed at Zouk Singapore (Ranked #5, DJ Mag’s Top 100 Clubs), MYA, Avalon, Ce La Vi (Ranked #88, DJ Mag’s Top 100 Clubs), Levels, and Fuse – among many other venues. She has also showcased her talents across different regions of the world, including New York, Valencia, Hong Kong, Melbourne, Bangkok, Ho Chi Minh, Taipei – with upcoming shows in Shanghai & Guangzhou.Follow DJ Tinc on:

"Mateo Paz is an artist whose passion for music exudes him, when he isn’t out DJ’ing, he is dedicating his spare time to create stunning Progressive House tunes or promoting the best-undiscovered talent in the scene on his weekly ‘Gain’ podcast. Towards the end of 2018, Mateo released a single with Grammy-nominated Eddie Amador and Kwanza Jones — reaching the Top 20 on the Billboard Chart – a mean feat for any producer to achieve. We chat to Mateo to discuss his career as a DJ.In my home, music has always been listened to a lot. That inspired me to get into this world and start creating my own sounds.I started 19 years ago. I remember like it was yesterday!I was playing at a private home party. It was a good place to start experimenting with sounds. You’re basically practicing for a club.Of course, I like to play my tracks, but I also love to play other talented producers and remixers.For my radio podcast -I don’t have one, prefer to play always fresh and undiscovered tracks.  When it comes to live performances, I love to play my collaboration with Asmik Shiroyan called ‘Mine Alone.’As a DJ, I used to train once at the Vestax DJ camp, I met many good hip-hop DJs, but also many skilled House Music DJs. I was also at the school of the Polish-Japanese Academy of Information Technology and Sound Production.When I worked in Dubai/Abu Dhabi as a resident DJ I played 8 hours without a break. That was my personal record.It definitely has to be my performance at Sensation (Wicked Wonderland) in Poland. It was a special experience that shaped my future DJ career.It’s hard to say. I highlighted Sensation but I really had amazing experience playing with Carl Cox at Global Gathering and several other major events. I also really enjoyed playing at the Formula 1 after party.Burning Man, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and Tomorrowland for sure.Trust your intuition; don’t let others try to tell you which path you should choose when it comes to your music genre. Let your inspiration lead you and make your own sound.It’s a long-lasting process. I try to devote a minimum of 15-30 minutes a day to sort new recordings. I use tools such as Mixed in Key or Platinum Notes they can really help.My favorite is probably every performance where Hernan Cattaneo has played. I can’t decide a single one set.Definitely yes! Nowadays, in the music industry, it is difficult to exist without your own tracks.I will appear in several places in South America.

"Adam Holiday developed a passion for music that can be traced back to his younger years, surrounded by his musical family who helped him harness his ability to become a musician. By the age of only 17, he had secured his first residency and was touring some of Johannesburg’s biggest clubs on the circuit. Since then, he has had releases on 99 Waves, Shoefiti, Solid Grooves, Suma and Enjoy It Productions. He has been dropping serious Tech House bangers in the past years.1 – How did it all start for you? What brought you to the House music scene?I was always into music from a very young age and it was my uncle who introduced me to electronic music. He played me CDs by Ministry of Sound, Subliminal Sessions, Miss Moneypenny and I was instantly hooked. I would come home from school and just sit on my computer listening to these CDs over and over then shortly after that got into DJing.2 – What do you personally consider to be the incisive moments in your artistic career?I would have to say when I got my first record signed to a label. I had that goal for so long and when I finally achieved it, it was a major stepping-stone as it spurred me on and I thought if I could get one signed I could get 100 signed.Then another incisive moment was when Erick Morillo supported one of my tracks ‘I like it When U’ on his SiriusXM Radio show. He is one of the biggest icons in the House music scene so for him to support my music was such an honour.Also, playing at some of Johannesburg’s iconic clubs like Tempo’s and Roxy’s.3 – What do you usually start with when preparing for a set?To be honest, in terms of the music I never prepare for a set, I take all my music with me to my gigs so I can play a wide selection of tracks from slow and deep to pumping peak-hour tracks it’s just depending on what’s required for the gig. I try to get an idea of the vibe of the venue before I play and then when I am at the gig I will work off the crowd. The only thing I really do before a set is have a coffee and sit for a few minutes before in pure silence to clear my mind. 4 – Why remix Wu-Tang of all Hip Hop groups?I liked the sample used in the Wu-Tang – ‘Gravel Pit’ track, the sample was originally from a track made in 1965 by Antoine Duhamel called ‘Belphegor’s Theme’. The sample has such a mysterious feel and I always thought it would work so well in a house track and I have wanted to make a track with it for a while.5 – Are you planning on using more Hip Hop classics in future productions?Possibly, for me when I produce music I take inspiration from wherever it comes from, whether that be from a Hip Hop track or other musical genres. Why not break the boundaries of musical genres and come up with a fresh sound.6 – If you could eternally be stuck in one year’s music scene, which year would it be?2002 for sure, that was the year I went to Ibiza for the first time and the House music back then was out of this world! The music was ‘cool’ and every track sounded distinct, tracks like Who Da Funk – Shiny Disco Balls, Layo & Bushwacka – Love Story and Shakedown – At Night (Kid Creme Remix) were destroying the clubs like Pacha and Space. This is when I truly developed my love for house music.7 – What is something that bugs/irritates you about the House music scene?I think right now what I am finding is the Tech House scene is a lot of music that is sounding too similar. It sounds like most tracks in the top 100 Tech House of Beatport was made by the same producer. Also, nowadays tracks have a short shelf life they seem to be played for 2 months and then they are forgotten about unless they are tracks that hit the big time like ‘Cola’ by Camelphat or ‘Losing It’ by FISHER.8 – What is your opinion regarding the difference between old school DJing where everything was restricted to vinyl and modern DJing where most tracks are never put on any physical medium before or after release?It has its pros and cons before it was a lot harder to get a track signed with a label. Labels would need to put a lot more money forward into a release to get it on vinyl, which made them more selective and had a certain number of releases every year. Nowadays labels can take more chances on the up and coming artists and sign more tracks as their upfront costs for a release are a lot lower.On the flip side nowadays DJs have the benefits of being able to buy more music as it is cheaper for DJs. Plus taking a flash drive to your gigs is a whole lot easier than a crate of vinyl.9 – What is one track that never gets old for you no matter how many times you hear it?Pryda – Pjanoo – such a great track, timeless, I will be playing this to my grandkids for sure!10 – What is one House track that got popular that you can’t stand?When you say a track ‘I can’t stand’ there is one that comes straight to mind, it isn’t a House track but the track – ‘Sebastian Ingrosso, Alesso – Calling’. I know it went massive, got a lot of support and did really well; unfortunately, it just didn’t do it for me.11 – If you were not a House DJ/producer, what other electronic music genres would you choose to produce/DJ?Euphoric trance for sure, the old school vibe that Paul Van Dyk and Tiesto used to play. I still listen to trance a lot and still love the vibe good trance music has.Adam Holiday OnlineAdam Holiday on Soundcloud

"J. Cole has hopped on a new song from Ty Dolla $ign. Titled “Purple Emoji”, it features soulful production from MXXWLL, and lustful, longing rhymes from the Dreamville rapper.“Black angel with the regular name/ Strangers I could never contain my passion for you,” Cole says during his turn with the mic. “In public I know that you loving/ I’m trying to put one more little boy in your stomach/ No fronting I keep it 100/ If you was to leave me I know I’m gonna plummet.”Take a listen below.(Read: The 20 Highest Paid Rappers)“Purple Emoji” is expected to appear on Ty new album, which he’s currently finishing up. As he told Beats 1’s Zane Lowe, the collaboration came together completely by chance. He and Cole happened to be at the same studio on the same day — conveniently at the exact time Ty was recording with Kanye West.“I was at this studio called Jungle City in New York working on Yandhi with Kanye,” he told Lowe. “And then just turns out Cole was in the room right next to me. When I saw him I was like bro I got something to play you,” he detailed. “I’m like, ‘Yo, I just did this one I thought would be crazy for both of us.’ So he came in my room, I played it for him immediately and he did his verse in five minutes.”Ty’s last LP was 2017’s Beach House, but he’s teamed up with ScHoolboy Q and Kehlani in recent months. As for Cole, he debuted his Dreamville Festival in North Carolina in April and reportedly has recorded music with Drake. His last full-length was the acclaimed KOD from 2018.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>",articles40,"['“Black', 'Emoji', 'Kanye West', 'Lowe', '’ So']"
"Mannequin Pussy return next month with their third album, Patience. Due out through Epitaph, the follow-up to 2016’s Romantic was recorded with producer and engineer Will Yip (Quicksand, The Menzingers), who helped the band channel a different kind of energy in the studio.“In the past there’s been a chaotic feeling to the recording process, but working with Will put us in a different headspace,” explained singer Marisa Dabice. “It helped us show our progression over the past few years and make a very crisp-sounding record, without losing the dirtiness of what Mannequin Pussy really is.”(Read: The 100 Best Pop Punk Bands)April’s lead single, “Drunk II”, saw the Philly punk outfit pull back a bit on the chaos in lieu of more patience. We hear this again on the group’s newest offering, “Who Are You”, in which Dabice uses a gentle approach to encourage self-love and self-empowerment.“Oh, who taught you to hate the way you are? If I were you there’s not a thing I would restart,” she sings earnestly and calmly. “I love who you are.”Stream it below.Patience arrives June 21st and will be supported with a corresponding tour. Grab your tickets here.",articles40,"['The Menzingers', 'Dabice']"
"King Princess has thrown it back to the good old days of America’s Next Top Model with her newest release “We Were All Rooting for You, Sis (how dare you)”.Coming in at only two minutes, the first third of the song features a psychedelic, experimental remix of Tyra Banks’ now-legendary and highly memed blowup at ANTM contestant Tiffany Richardson in 2005. In a brilliant move, the latter half of the song drops into a hypnotic, house-inspired beat, with the burgeoning pop star sing-chants of “You have to be fierce” working into the backing rhythm. Appropriately, samples of Banks admonishing, “I think that’s what you can’t handle,” as well as a new clip that reminds “I think you need to put some gratitude into your attitude, girl,” are worked in throughout.Listen to the meme-worthy track below.Earlier in the year, King Princess teamed with Fiona Apple to release an updated version of “I Know”. The collaboration followed the release of her debut EP, last April’s Make My Bed, and standalone single in September, “Pussy Is God”.",articles40,"['King Princess', 'Earlier', 'King Princess']"
"Origins, a recurring feature, provides artists with an opportunity to dissect the various inspirations behind their latest release.Despite being only 22, Samia has a self-awareness beyond her years. The indie singer-songwriter is masterful in her sharp lyrics, which capture common anxieties and frustrations with a poet’s charm. She finds painful moments and leans into their messy, ugly details, transforming them into defiant common touchstones speckled throughout life. One breakup song ends mid-sentence, evoking the discomfort and anticipation of separation, while another is inspired by a high-school memory of boys groping her breasts, using the experience to inspect the politics and power of women’s desirability.But, the New York singer offers more than poignant confessional lyrics. She also crafts striking compositions, which range from dramatic, wailing folk ballads backed by simple piano or acoustic guitar accompaniments to gritty and grungy rock anthems. Always at the forefront is her crystalline voice, carrying each number with its deft transitions between ranges and its emotional power.Now, Samia has released a new single, “Ode to Artifice”, that carries forward her thoughtful examinations, turning the lens inward. She explained, “‘Ode to Artifice’ is a desperate plea; my authentic self is lusting after my stage/party persona and begging her to merge.” Using this idea of two distinct selves as framework, the indie rocker teamed with director Nick D’agostino to craft a music video that illustrates the disparity. She adds, “Nick D’agostino and I decided to tell the story of a girl who spends weeks obsessing over the way she’ll present herself at prom, only to discover that she is grossly underdressed compared to the more colorful and popular version of herself who is thriving at the event.”D’agostino elaborated,“While it’s super fun and up-tempo, the song resonates with me for a much darker reason. It seems that everyone is constantly projecting, curating, and uploading different versions of themselves to the world. Be it who they hope to be or to hide something they are, we’re relying on these personas to carry a part of our personalities for us. What better place is there to explore an encounter with a performed version of oneself than a high school prom?”Watch the video, which features a cameo from Mary-Louise Parker, below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Samia spoke to us about the Origins of “Ode to Artifice,” more clearly delineating the inspirations that contributed to the number. Read on below.Everyday Self vs. Stage Persona:The primary inspiration for this song came from being in social situations and wishing I could perform the way I do on stage. We conceptualized, based on that feeling, a fictional narrative in which my everyday self is desperately in love with and pursuing my stage persona.Wanda Jackson:I was listening to a lot of Wanda Jackson at the time, and Kit had been sitting on this amazing chord progression that was reminiscent of her period/sound.The Supremes:I spent that week watching videos of The Supremes and fantasizing about writing a song that I could totally over-perform on stage with my friends.Voguing:“Voguing like I don’t know how” was our way of articulating the feeling of witnessing some grand cultural phenomenon that I know I could never quite mimic. I remember watching kids vogueing at a drag club my first year in college and just being totally astounded and intimidated by their self-certainty and talent.Banshees:We spent a whole day trying to figure out a last piece of imagery to culminate the story and thoroughly represent the chaotic nature of my everyday self. We landed on the idea of the banshee inside of me, ghastly white, towering over myself and screaming at the top of its lungs so that the artifice self can take over and guide us back into the script.",articles40,"['Samia', 'Samia', 'Artifice', 'hidden;line', 'Samia', 'Artifice', 'The Supremes']"
"New music from Jonny Greenwood was debuted on the latest installment of NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert series. Although the Radiohead guitarist wasn’t physically on hand for the recording, he and NPR enlisted the talents of the Ensemble Signal music group to perform two of his compositions, “Three Miniatures from Water” and “88 (No. 1)”, on violin, piano, cello, and more.Inspired by French composer Olivier Messiaen, “Three Miniatures from Water” was originally written in 2018, but the Tiny Desk Concert marks the first time it’s ever been performed live. It was “originally a sketch for an Australian Chamber Orchestra commission in 2014,” according to Greenwood, adding, “I thought it’d be easier to approach writing for full orchestra by starting with a piano miniature and scaling it up. In fact, only some of the material made it to the final commission, and I always felt the original three miniatures hung together well enough as its own piece of music.”(Read: Ranking: Every Radiohead Song from Worst to Best)As for “88 (No. 1)”, the work also nods to Messiaen’s material before “becoming a celebration of the mechanical nature of the piano.” Greenwood explained further, “The performer has to put fingerless gloves on halfway through, partly in tribute to the immortal Glenn Gould, and partly because the technique requires some painful hammering. But don’t let that fool you into thinking the music is dark or angry: It is — or is meant to be — joyful.”Greenwood also praised NPR’s Tiny Desk Concert series for being able to capture the “rawness” of artists,It’s good to see musicians in the raw, away from stage lighting and backing tracks — as if they’ve just stopped by an office to play over a lunch break, with desk-bound employees watching on. The performances should expose flaws, but instead they tend to expose musicians being casually brilliant, like the members of Ensemble Signal, who certainly play these pieces beautifully.Watch the full session below.Greenwood is expected to debut a new composition, Horror vacui, in London in September as part of this year’s BBC Proms series. He and the rest of Radiohead were finally inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame earlier this year.",articles40,"['Messiaen’s', 'Radiohead']"
"B Boys have announced their sophomore album, Dudu, due out July 26th through Captured Records.Recorded by Gabe Wax at Outlier Inn and mixed by Andy Chugg, Dudu draws on influences like The Clash, Wire, and Talking Heads, with the band using their high-energy, raw sound to offer poignant commentary on social issues and daily life in their home of Brooklyn.The LP’s lead song, “I Want”, features Pill’s Veronica Torres. The track offers a brash and explosive critique on modern-day greed and capitalism. Listen below.Dudu Artwork:B Boys have also announced a North American tour.

"Two years ago, METZ released their third record, Strange Peace. While we all await word on a fourth full-length, the noise-rock outfit is satiating fans with a newly announced rarities collection. Entitled Automat, the album is due out on July 12th via Sub Pop.For Automat, the Toronto-based band has compiled a selection of rarities dating back to 2009.

"King Louie — whose real name is Louis Johnson Jr. — is making a comeback this year. Earlier in the month, the Chicago rapper appeared on Future’s “My Peak” alongside Chance the Rapper. Today, the “godfather of Chicago Drill rap” has released “Tesla”, marking his first single in five years.For the release, the rapper has signed a new deal with Chicago’s Machine Entertainment Group, adding a statement that he’s “finally being able to get the music out to the supporters.” The label also promises more music on the way as a follow-up to the drum-heavy “Tesla”.King Louie’s career has been marred by tribulations over the past decade. The hip-hop artist and producer was hit by a car at the end of the last decade, which broke both his legs and forced him to relearn how to walk. Despite this, he continued to gain fame with a stream of new mixtapes, culminating with 2014’s Tony. The next year, Louie was shot in the head, prompting another period of recovery.Now, though, the King has arisen once again.

"Dutch DJ and producer Armin Van Buuren has teamed with David Lee Roth for a remix of Van Halen’s 1983 anthem “Jump”. The single is out today through Big Beat Records, and you can stream it below.The remix saw its debut live at ULTRA Miami earlier this year with a collaborative performance between Van Buuren and Roth. Building from an isolated vocal track, Van Buuren adds his signature progressive trance backbeat, re-imagining the stadium rock jam as a full-blown dance number. The song’s original synth line works remarkably well among the EDM aesthetics.One of Van Halen’s most endearing and dance-worthy tracks, “Jump” remains the band’s most successful single, which peaked at No. 1 on the Billboard charts in its day. Van Buuren’s remix updates the song for a new audience of listeners and EDM fans, with Roth’s collaboration bridging the gap between genres and eras.As for Roth himself, the iconic frontman has been active on other alternative fronts, as well, having recently launched INK the original, a brand focusing on the preservation and brightening of tattoos.",articles40,"['David Lee Roth', 'Van Halen’s', 'Van Halen', 'Van Buuren’s', 'Roth’s']"

"It’s the meme that just won’t die. Genuine pop stars like Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, and Shawn Mendes can’t even stop Lil Nas X and Billy Ray Cyrus’ “Old Town Road” from riding hard at the top of the charts. Now, the internet star and country stalwart have probably extended their reign another few weeks thanks to the new video for the track.The visual’s loose premise finds Nas X and Cyrus running from the law — in this case, Chris Rock and Ha Ha Davis — after a bank heist. When they’re fired upon by some unfriendly locals, Lil Nas X finds himself sent through a warmhole from 1889 to 2019. There, with his brown leather duster and hat (ya know, despite the lyrics and their complete butchering of the pronunciation of “matte black”) still on, he ends up in a street race with Vince Staples and at a town hall bingo night run by Rico Nasty.Look, none of it really makes sense, right to Diplo playing the washboard — an instrument which doesn’t even appear in the original track. Beat maker YoungKio and Jozzy also appear, so watch the clip below, and maybe this can be the end of this whole thing?",articles40,"['Taylor Swift', 'Justin Bieber', 'Lil Nas X', 'Billy Ray Cyrus’', 'Nas X', 'Lil Nas X', 'Vince Staples', 'Rico Nasty', 'Look']"
"Mike Patton has a new album on the way. The Faith No More singer has teamed with renowned French composer Jean-Claude Vannier for a 12-song collection called Corpse Flower, which is due out September 13th via Ipecac Recordings.Patton met Vannier through his work with French singer and artist Serge Gainsbourg. As the alt-metal rocker recounted,“Jean-Claude and I met while working together on a Gainsbourg retrospective at the Hollywood Bowl in 2011… We bonded immediately. I could see he had a dedication and attention to detail that was relentless so the respect I had for him in my mind was magnified in person. We spoke loosely about working together in the future… and it took some time, but after a few years I contacted him and we began to ignite some sparks.”A legendary musician in his own right, Vannier has been cited by the likes of Beck, Portishead, and Massive Attack as inspiration. However, even Vannier couldn’t help but become awe-struck by his new-found collaborator:“I would send Mike rough versions of the songs to get his thoughts, then I’d wait impatiently, staring at the clock, until I received his response. He made my music awaken with his unique perspective and interpretations of my songs. A formidable vocalist, with a sense of humor, Mike and I created a strong, beautiful and sincere collection of music, as well as a friendship.”A variety of musicians, both in Los Angeles and Paris, took part in the recording of Corpse Flower. The LA-based sessions included Smokey Hormel (Beck, Johnny Cash), Justin Meldal-Johnsen (Beck, Air, Nine Inch Nails), and James Gadson (Beck, Jamie Lidell). Parsian contributors included Denys Lable, Bernard Paganotti (Magma), Daniel Ciampolini, Didier Malherbe, Léonard Le Cloarec, and the Bécon Palace String Ensemble.As the effort’s lead single, Patton and Vannier have released “On Top of the World”. Laced with whistling throughout, the song is fairly laid-back and breezy, until it reaches a more hard-edged climax two-thirds of the way through.

"German industrial rockers Rammstein triumphantly return with the release of their untitled seventh studio album and first in over a decade. Stream the entire album on below.The album’s release comes after months of hype following the success of lead single, “Deutschland”, the first piece of new music released by the band since 2011. The song reached No. 1 on the charts in Germany, Hungary, and Switzerland, as well as reaching No. 4 in Finland and Austria.The video for the song has also garnered much attention and controversy for its dark imagery — par for a Rammstein video — and violent depiction of Germany’s past, from the Romans’ defeat by Germanic tribes in 9 A.D. to the police state of East German. As of this writing, the video has been viewed over 50 million times: watch it below.“With Rammstein, people tend to talk about the fire and all the live stuff,” guitarist Richard Kruspe told us in an interview. “I thought, ‘I don’t want to be another KISS,’ where people talk about makeup and stuff like that and no one talks about the music.”A second single from the album, “Radio”, was also released, hitting No. 4 on the German charts.

"Unless you’re on or watch Fox News, odds are you’re pretty outraged by what just went down in Alabama. After the State Senate voted to pass the country’s most restrictive anti-abortion bill — one that does not even include exceptions in cases of rape or incest — Governor Kay Ivey signed the ban into law. While even Ivey admits the law is more of a ploy in hopes of getting Roe v. Wade overturned rather than honest legislation, it’s still a cynical, gross, and dangerous political action.Many public figures have spoken out against the bill, but Tim Heidecker has taken it a step further. He’s released a new song called “To the Men”, which speaks directly to the 25 white, male, Republican senators who voted to pass the bill.The track tells the horrible tale of a newly 13-year-old girl who is convinced to have sex with a boy after school. Strict taboos mean she can’t tell her parents when she ends up pregnant and the father decides to disappear. With no recourse in a state where doctors performing abortions can be jailed for 99 years, she goes to a back alley clinic — and doesn’t survive.It’s heartbreaking. It’s disgusting. And it’s exactly what the politicians in Alabama (and, as the song mentions, Ohio, Georgia, and elsewhere) just voted in favor of.Proceeds from the song go to benefit The Yellowhammer Fund, which provides funding for those seeking care in any of Alabama’s three abortion clinics. (Clinics which, it’s important to remember, are thankfully still operating and will likely continue to operate as the law gets tied up in courts.) Listen to “To the Men” below.Heidecker is set to release his new album, What the Brokenhearted Do…, on June 7th. Find the full “To the Men” lyrics below.She was poor she was just 13
She was 12 a month ago
She was living in Alabama
She was living in Ohio
She was living in Georgia
She didn’t have anywhere to goShe was young, she didn’t know the rules
She didn’t think she could say no
thought it was love and it’d be forever
In a locker room after school
She couldn’t tell anybody
couldn’t tell her mom or dad
She didn’t know what to do
All she knew was that it was badShe was living in Alabama
She was living in Ohio
She was living in Georgia
She didn’t have anywhere to goTold a friend who had been down that road
Told a friend she was late
And the friend said she had no choice
Have the baby or get out of the state
The girl didn’t have much money
and the boy disappeared
for a week she said she wasn’t feeling good
as she rolled up in a ball of fearShe was living in Alabama
She was living in Ohio
She was living in Georgia
She didn’t have anywhere to goThere’s a place in the run down part of town
A place young girls stay far from
She could go and take her chances
In an hour the deed be done
To the men in theirs brown suits
To the men passing laws
I just have a simple question
To the men without flawsHave you seen a young girl dying
Have you seen em bleed to death
Have you seen a young girl dying
Have you seen em take their final breath",articles40,"['Tim Heidecker', 'Alabama’s', 'Heidecker']"
"We’ve been obsessed with Hatchie lately, and now it looks like she’s obsessed, too.Hatchie shared a brand new single called “Obsessed”, in which she details her obsession with a crush and the all-consuming nature of such. As she sings in a whispery voice, guitars cushion her voice, fading in and out like a crossover of stringy ’90s indie rock, gentle shoegaze, and electronic dream pop. It bodes well for the rest of Hatchie’s debut album, Keepsake, which drops June 21st via Double Double Whammy.The song’s music video elevates the song’s hazy appeal and charming simplicity. In the video, compiled tour footage shows Hatchie and the rest of her bandmates goofing around on the road, dancing outside of restaurants, shotgunning beers, and jumping around on hotel beds. It’s the type of youthful, endless energy the song itself channels. Check it out below.“Obsessed” is the latest song from Hatchie to show off her skills as a dream pop singer-songwriter. Earlier this year, she released “Stay With Me”, a song practically made for crying in the club, as well as “Without a Blush”, where she dabbles in shoegaze waves.After wrapping up a North American tour opening for Girlpool, it looks like Hatchie has more live flair to bring to the stage. She just announced a fall North American headlining tour. It kicks off at Great Scott in Boston on September 5th and wraps up in Vancouver at Fortune Sound Club on September 29th. Before that, she will open for Japanese Breakfast in Central Park and will perform at festivals like Primavera Sound, Heartland Festival, and Big Pineapple Music Festival.

"Origins is a recurring feature that provides artists an opportunity to dissect the various inspirations behind their latest release.Nothing tests the solidity of a bond like hardship and change. Whether you’re switching jobs or neighborhoods, starting a family or breaking up with a partner, cutting out cigarettes or taking on a new hobby, it’s the ebb and flow of life that usually weeds out the passing acquaintances from the ride or die loyalists. For California artist TRACE, her launching of her alt-pop music career has been the litmus test for her friend group.After first working as a magazine editor, the Orange County-bred TRACE headed for the City of Angels to chase a dream like that of her mother, Carol Kim, often referred to as the Tina Turner of Vietnam. TRACE fully immersed herself in the entertainment biz and released her debut EP, Low, in 2016. It was then that she really got the chance to reflect on her transformation and take stock of those who chose to stick around and be part of it.TRACE’s ruminating eventually birthed “All My Friends”, a new song which Consequence of Sound is premiering today. The track both celebrates lasting friendships, as well as talks about just how hard it is to consistently cultivate the intimacy necessary to maintain them — especially in the age of social media.“Restless, I just need a mirror and have the guts to say/ It all to my face/ That it’s OK to change,” she sings in the opening verse. TRACE, whose tangible longing and love for chilled out and hazy sad pop has garnered her comparisons to Lana Del Rey, desperately needs emotional support and a fresh outsider perspective from her pals. “There’s nothing wrong with you, I wanna hear them say/ Cuz I find myself losing sleep/ I get in my own way.”Take a listen below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span><span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>“All My Friends” comes ahead of TRACE’s sophomore EP, which is due out later this year via Ultra Music. Speaking to CoS, she explained the song’s meaning in her own words,“It signifies a reflection on the power of relationships in my life. Throughout the process of writing songs over the past 2 years, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the relationships we keep and why we keep them — how many are life-giving and honest? It’s interesting that we’re living in a world ruled by social media, events, and networking, yet at times we feel lonelier than ever, and connections feel more draining and less enjoyable. There’s a resounding realization that while our access to people/friends feels limitless and technically easy, it’s actually very difficult to cultivate true intimacy. True intimacy requires trust and commitment and oftentimes I feel like we take one, leave the other, or vice versa. Who really shows up when you need them to? So, with All My Friends, I want to ask the listener, WHO ARE YOUR FRIENDS? because I’m learning the answer is a direct mirror of the person we are.”TRACE also went into detail about the specific inspirations that led to the track, which include her LA digs, a Roland Juno, and the feeling of loneliness.Los Angeles:When I moved here after living in San Diego for a hot second, I felt transported into a new world. LA’s energy is so distinct and specific, but I never thought it would be an actual city of dreams for me. Part of “All My Friends” gives nod to the city and what it’s done for/to me — including helping me realize that I wanted to do music. It has changed me and my relationships in a good way.Social media:I’m always curious about relationships in general. A big undertone of “All My Friends” is the power of social media and how it feels so easy to keep in touch with friends or to make new ones, but are they really your friends? I think being in an age of dense connection, it can be hard to cultivate actual, authentic relationships.The Roland Juno:When my producer (Bram Inscore) was playing on his Roland Juno, the first few notes he played felt like the perfect, captivating intro for this song. There is a sound that resonates with the elemental emotion that “All My Friends” embodies: dreaminess meets loneliness. The synthesizer is known from an earlier era of house music, so you can hear an energy throughout the song while also feeling its depth. The entire track, but especially the intro, felt signature to me and that was kind of a goal.Loneliness:When I was moving to LA, people from home, school, etc. would tell me I was “living the dream.” It can be a very lonely thing to do, something most people can’t personally relate to. Yet it can also be a lonely thing to feel that way around those who can. Our lives are in constant motion, always changing and dreams and priorities can shift. It can all feel pretty lonesome.Intimacy:Obviously “All My Friends” is about friendship, but it also focuses on intimacy. Whether you’re pursuing people or letting go, intimacy affects how we operate in our relationships and I think even how we see ourselves. We need our friends and people, but we also desperately need actual intimacy. And that means having trust AND commitment. I wanted to ask the listener, who are your friends? Can you actually depend on them? Is there a foundation in your relationship that gives you life or does it makes you feel phony/unknown?",articles40,"['say/ It', 'Lana Del Rey', 'hidden;line', 'hidden;line', 'All My Friends']"
"Two summers ago, New Order took the stage at Manchester’s Old Granada Studios for a special five-night residency. Part of the Manchester International Festival, the intimate sets were dubbed “∑(No,12k,Lg,17Mif) New Order + Liam Gillick: So it goes..” and saw New Order reimagine songs from their extensive catalog, including their last album, 2015’s Music Complete.

"Slipknot have revealed details of their highly anticipated new album, which is titled We Are Not Your Kind. Additionally, the band has unveiled the members’ new masks, as well as a video for the first official single, “Unsainted” (watch below).The album, which will arrive on August 9th, consists of 14 songs, and interestingly, it turns out that “All Out Life”, the surprise track Slipknot dropped this past Halloween, was a stand-alone single, and not part of the tracklist for We Are Not Your Kind.Along with the album announcement comes the unveiling of Slipknot’s new masks, both in a new promo photo and the music video for “Unsainted”. The song and its video, directed by the band’s percussionist Shawn “Clown” Crahan, “offer a glimpse at the future of one of rock’s most popular, and deeply enigmatic bands,” according to a press release.(Buy: Tickets to Slipknot’s Upcoming Tour Dates)Regarding the album, Crahan stated, “These days the art we are making comes with the highest reward, because it’s taken the most time. Almost four years to create this emotion and temperature, and the reward now is nothing short of salvation.”Guitarist Jim Root added, “This is most time we’ve had to write a record, and work stuff out together.  One of my inspirations this time around was those artists that recorded full length albums — not just songs.  While the industry is moving toward singles, Slipknot wanted to make an album experience, front to back.”As previously reported, Slipknot will perform on Jimmy Kimmel Live tomorrow night (May 17th).Following the Kimmel performance, Slipknot will embark on a European tour in June, and their “Knotfest Roadshow” North American trek with Volbeat, Gojira, and Behemoth in late July.

"Next month marks the arrival of Let’s Rock, the first new Black Keys album in five years. In anticipation, the garage rockers have let loose a winding single called “Go”, as well as a funny music video detailing what band members Patrick Carney and Dan Auerbach have supposedly been up to since the release of 2014’s Turn Blue. In the Bryan Schlam-directed clip, the duo is pressured by record label Warner Bros. to make a comeback. The only problem? Carney and Auerbach haven’t spoken in years. To help move things along, both are shipped off to Happy Trails: Intentional Community & Spiritual Retreat, where they’re encouraged to participate in outdoor meditation sessions, sage burning, and therapy support groups. Instead, the two flip each other off, brawl, and rock out in a forest while tripping on some natural hallucinogens.(Buy: Tickets to The Black Keys’ Upcoming Tour Dates)“It was great making this video with Bryan, partially because it was filmed at the very type of place it is making fun of,” Carney said in a press release. Auerbach jokingly added, “The video was fun, but we still haven’t spoken.”Check out “Go” below.Let’s Rock officially drops June 28th; for more, revisit previous singles “Lo/Hi” and “Eagle Birds”.

"As of late, the great PJ Harvey has been lending her talents to a variety of film and theatrical projects. Last year, she contributed a new song called “An Acre of Land” to the British thriller, Dark River, and earlier this year, she scored a stage production of All About Eve. Now, she’s composed music for a new four-part drama series from English filmmaker Shane Meadows called The Virtues.Included within Harvey’s score is a new track called “The Crowded Cell”, which plays over the closing credits of each episode. Take a listen below.In a statement, Harvey said, “I am so happy to have provided the original music for this extraordinary and powerful new drama by a director I have admired and followed all my life. Shane has a unique directness and sensitivity to his work which I am drawn to and aspire to in my own work, so our collaboration was open and trusting. I sent Shane ideas as demos for him to try out as he edited and let him choose what he used and where to the greatest effect. In the end we both loved how the demos worked so left them as they were, adding to the raw beauty of the piece.”Harvey’s last album came in 2016 with The Hope Six Demolition Project. Hopefully a follow-up release isn’t too far off in the horizon.",articles40,"['PJ Harvey', 'Harvey’s', 'Shane']"
"Volbeat have announced details of their seventh studio album. The Danish rockers’ new LP is titled Rewind, Replay, Rebound, and will arrive on August 2nd. Additionally, the band has released a video for the new song “Leviathan” (watch below).“The whole point for us going into the studio, is because you still have something to prove — not just for the fans, but mostly for yourself,” said frontman Michael Poulsen in a press release. “We would not be able to do this record if it wasn’t for the work we have done in the past. No matter how old the band gets or how many records we do, there is always going to be that signature sound.”That signature sound that Poulsen mentions combines psychobilly with punk, hard rock and metal, and that’s on full display in the aforementioned new single “Leviathan”. The tune follows the 37-second track “Parasite” that Volbeat dropped last week.(Buy: Tickets to Volbeat’s Upcoming Tour Dates)The new album will be available as a standard album, a 2-CD deluxe edition, and a limited-edition colored vinyl version. Pre-orders are available at this location.Clutch frontman Neil Fallon provides guest vocals on the track “Die to Live”, while Slayer / Exodus guitarist Gary Holt contributes a solo to the song “Cheapside Sloggers”.Along with the album news, Volbeat have also announced a fall European tour featuring support from Baroness and Danko Jones.

"Charli XCX is expected to make her big comeback this year. The English singer has promised a new album, marking her first proper LP (excluding mixtapes) since Sucker in 2014. Today, her return commences, as the pop vocalist has released her first new music of 2019, “Blame It on Your Love”, which features our queen and savior Lizzo.Charli called upon her frequent collaborators Stargate to produce the number, with help from A. G. Cook and Finn Keane. Penned in Los Angeles, “Blame It on Your Love” might sound familiar to fans, as it recycles the main vocal sample of “Track 10”, which was released as the closing song on Charli’s Pop 2 mixtape. While the 2017 track took a more experimental route, the latest from the “Break the Rules” singer is drastically more radio friendly.(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Pop Albums of 2019)With a bouncing beat reminiscent of tropical house, “Blame It on Your Love” lands solidly in the singer’s wheelhouse, offering a breezy, feel-good pop track. Toward the end of the song, Lizzo makes her cameo, giving a highlight-worthy edge to the tune with her more brash sing-song rap verse. Listen to the collaboration below.“Blame It on Your Love” Artwork:On June 6th, Charli will help kick off Pride Week by co-hosting the first-ever Go West Fest alongside her “1999” collaborate Troye Sivan. It goes down at the Wiltern in Los Angeles, and you can get tickets here.As for Lizzo, she’s currently touring behind her smash new album, Cuz I Love You; find tickets here.

"The hype for Baroness’ forthcoming LP, Gold & Grey, is building as its June 14th release grows closer. The band has shared the latest single, the passionate, vocal-dominant “Throw Me an Anchor”, and has announced a seven-week European tour in support of Volbeat, which starts in September. Stream the track and check out the dates below.“Throw Me an Anchor” maintains the kinetic musicianship and emotional expression that defined the previous singles. John Baizley’s vocal performance takes the lead here, as he hits a vastness of ranges and soaring melodies over a bed of progressive riffing and complex percussion from drummer Sebastian Thomson. The instrumental coda lets Thomson take over, breaking into prog rhythms as a textural wash of synth guides the track to its conclusion. For its relatively short 4-minute duration, a lot happens.(Buy: Tickets to Baroness’ Upcoming Tour Dates)In addition to previously releasing the songs “Borderlines” and “Seasons” from Gold & Grey, the band recently partnered with Adult Swim to release another album track, “Front Toward Enemy”, on the Metal Swim 2 compilation alongside acts like Sunn O))), Eyehategod, and more.It’s lining up to be a busy season for Baroness as they head out in support of the new record. The band embarks on a short run of acoustic in-store performances in the week leading up to the record release before hitting the road for a headlining North American jaunt, and then heading overseas with Volbeat.

"Origins is a recurring feature that provides artists a chance to pull back the veil on the various inspirations behind their latest song.You can learn a lot when you’re both a member of Neil Young’s backing band, Promise of the Real, and the son of Willie Nelson. Not only do you have the chance to learn some of their musical tricks, but you get to absorb wisdom from two of the most important minds in Americana. Micah Nelson, who happens to be have had these privileges for most of his life, is putting all those lessons to good use on his latest album as Particle Kid, Window Rock.Due out July 26th via OAR, the record finds Nelson turning his future folk microscope onto the existential crises plaguing our world. Together with co-producer Harlan Steinberger, Micah employed recording techniques that blend analog tapes with modern mixing tech, something he picked up from his work with Young. He recorded with his touring band — drummer Tony Peluso and bassist Jeff Smith — in Venice, California’s Hen House Studios.The results are as intimate in their psychedelic vastness as they are warm in their bedroom tones. Lead single “Stroboscopic Light”, for example, has a sense of chaos in the tumbling layers of sound, but threaded throughout is a hopefulness winding its way between the cacophony. It’s an appropriate mix of madness and optimism, as Nelson says the track tackles our “oversaturated post-modern age of narcissistic extremism and hyper-normalization.”Take a listen to “Stroboscopic Light” below via its accompanying video, which Nelson describes as “an abstract portrait of an extraterrestrial detective sent to Earth to investigate and document what the hell happened, but who discovers only madness, the fracturing of reality, and a planet in moral crisis, where the lines between good and evil have become blurred and undefined.” Get ready for a trip:Pre-orders for Window Rock are going on now. Particle Kid will tour behind the effort throughout summer, including dates with The Flaming Lips, Lukas Nelson and Promise of the Real, and Claypool Lennon Delirium. Check the schedule and then head here to snag tickets.For more on the depths explored on “Stroboscopic Light”, Nelson has broken down the song’s many existential Origins.Alan Watts’ Taoist View of the Universe:The idea that the concepts of “good” and “evil” are not universal truths, but human projections is something I think about often. This might come off to some as a form of “cosmic pessimism”… however depressing and hopeless some of my songs may seem, they should not be mistaken as pessimistic or misanthropic without any constructive solution. The solution is the song itself, the act of making art from a sense of futility… of turning the impulse of apathetic hopelessness into something, anything. Music is what feelings sound like. In my experience, “cosmic pessimism” is just a gateway drug to Taoism… or maybe it is Taoism’s evil twin! Just kidding.I’m not misanthropic… I’m just not a human-supremacist.John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s Bagism:John Lennon has been in my consciousness since before I can even remember. I’ve always appreciated his no-bullshit approach… just gimme some truth!! Even when it came to total psychedelic nonsense I always believed what John Lennon was singing. One of my favorite records is Plastic Ono Band… its so refreshingly raw and painfully real and perfectly imperfect like a private cathartic journal. I remember really digging that record while writing a lot of the songs for Window Rock.Sonic Youth and Neil Young’s Alternate Tunings:“Stroboscopic Light” is in an alternate tuning called C Modal. Actually all the strings are tuned a half step down from that, so I guess its actually B ModaI… I love alternate tunings… I’ve been experimenting with them for years. Neil Young has been a great mentor to me and has taught me some cool tunings and weird chords that have given him some of his greatest songs. Simply detuning a string or two on the guitar opens up a whole other dimension of sonic and emotional possibilities and can make an otherwise boring two chord song take on a new uncanny cinematic depth. The band I probably admire the most especially when it comes to alternate tunings is Sonic Youth. They may never know it, but they definitely helped me write this song.The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein:When I was a kid growing up the world always seemed to be ending tomorrow… from Y2K, to 9/11, to the bullshit Iraq war, Dick Cheney raping America, 2012, climate change, etc… Even being as lucky as I am to have had a great childhood, the world was still terrifying as fuck, and it seems to keep getting scarier. It’s so easy to get “the fear” just reading the news every day on yer phone… but giving in to the fear makes us more susceptible to manipulation and control… that is why art and humor (and lots of good coffee) will probably save us all (if we let it!).When I was 15 my mom was reading The Shock Doctrine by Naomi Klein. My mom has always been an outspoken activist. She would take me and my brother to protests in Washington as teenagers. One year we spent mothers day at a 24-hour war protest outside the White House during the Cheney administration. We were in the midst of the Iraq war, post 9/11, Cheney capitalizing off of the nation’s suffering, “Citizens United” hammering the final nail into the coffin of democracy…. And this book The Shock Doctrine nailed the whole situation on the head. It traces the origins of “disaster capitalism” back fifty years, to the University of Chicago under Milton Friedman, which created many of the leading neo-conservative and neo-liberal thinkers whose influence seems to permeate Washington now.I understand that there may actually be no ultimate meaning or purpose to anything I’m doing or singing about, but it doesn’t matter because it makes life way more tolerable and interesting! All we have is now.Adam Curtis’ HyperNormalisation:The corporate media in the US funding these neo-extremist political voices on both ends of the spectrum have made us all victims of hypernormalisation. The major head fuck frosting on the top of the cake is that we are all aware of it at this point… and the ones perpetuating it don’t even try to hide it, in fact they want us to know it. It keeps us stuck in a sort of Foucault-ian prison where the guards have no faces and the prison bars are invisible… and we pick a side and try to stand for some sort of cause only to realize our “cause” was a lie and the ground under our righteous ideology crumbles because it was designed and funded to divide and control us in the first place by the same people who designed and funded the opposing extremist movement. We are basically already living inside The Matrix… or at least the shitty prototype model!!I can’t help but write and sing about what I observe in this world… and I see a lot of corporate culture profiteering from the suffering of people and planet, trying to dominate every corner of everything until nothing is wild or free and art is dead. That doesn’t mean we can’t have a great time rebelling against it! It also doesn’t mean singing a song about it will make a difference, but that isn’t the point. Protests in general don’t tend to make an immediate difference, but that is missing the point too. Haskell Wexler once said something about how protests matter because its people coming together around a cause, and regardless of whether the politicians or rulers even notice them and change the law the next day, more importantly the people are able to recognize each other and know they are far from alone.I believe that ultimately change comes from within each of us. There are many things nature has already given us on the outside and inside to heal ourselves and let go of the things that keep us stuck in the Matrix… transcendental meditation, psychedelic plants… brain scans have shown both of those tools to wake up the entire brain in the same way… I believe that knowing ourselves, our truest selves beyond whatever role we happen to be playing at any given time by taking the time to familiarize ourselves with the deepest subtlest realms of the subconscious mind, is the most potent way to bring positivity into the world, while knowing that while we are here in this temporal dimension, stuck in time and duality, there cannot be positivity without negativity, and to reconcile that is to know peace and balance within ourselves… and lots of good coffee helps too!!Window Rock Artwork:Window Rock Tracklist:

"Over the last few years, Michael Angelakos has slowed down on Passion Pit. The group’s last new music was 2017’s Tremendous Sea of Love, with the frontman announcing a few months later that he was going on hiatus. Though they toured in 2018, Angelakos has been open about his bipolar disorder and that much of their return to the road stemmed from his need to make money to afford healthcare. It seems the band is back on a positive track, however, as in the midst of celebrating the 10th anniversary of Manners, Passion Pit has returned with their first new music in two years.The new single, titled “I FOUND U”, finds the band collaborating with Galantis, the Swedish electronic duo of Christian Karlsson (also of Miike Snow) and Linus Eklöw. The track offers up Passion Pit’s characteristically triumphant and beat-forward sound, leaning heavily into the more sugary-sweet side of things. However, the track contrasts this with darker lyrics that frankly discuss Angelakos’ journey over the last few years. “Just look how bad these last few years were to me/ They brought me lower than you’d ever believe/ No light to look up to,” he sings in the opening bars. Still, the song finds optimism, as Angelakos later sings out, “Just think how long we were both living in fear/ Can you remember how it even would feel/ Now we’ve finally broke through?”Listen to “I FOUDN U” below.Passion Pit is currently on the road for a special Manners anniversary tour.

"Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker has launched a new project under the moniker of Jarv Is… (get it?). He’s already mapped out a lengthy European festival tour, which includes appearances at London’s All Points East, Barcelona’s Primavera Sound, and Laois’ Electric Picnic. Now, in anticipation of this summer run, Cocker has released his debut single as Jarv Is… Entitled “Must I Evolve?”, it’s charging art rocker that quite literally charts human’s evolutionary history. Take a listen below.According to accompanying press materials for the song, “Must I Evolve?” will be available to purchase at Cocker’s upcoming live shows. That’s because “JARV IS… primarily a live experience,” a press statement explains. “Life is primarily a live experience.”",articles40,"['Jarvis Cocker', 'Laois’ Electric Picnic', 'Cocker’s', '“Life']"
"Stef Chura’s forthcoming new album, Midnight, isn’t just produced by Will Toledo, it also features him heavily. The Car Seat Headrest mastermind collaborated closely with Chura on the majority of the LP’s tracks, and can be heard almost everywhere. He’s never more present, however, than on the sort-of title track, “Sweet Sweet Midnight”.The latest single from the effort is a duet between the two, with Toledo also contributing guitar, bass, and synth to compliment Chura’s own six-string. Described by the latter as the most collaborative effort between Will and I,” “Sweet Sweet Midnight” pushes Chura’s songwriting into adventurous new territory. As she further explained in a press statement,“The chorus and guitar riff are something I had been playing with for a while after a close friend of mine died. We built the song off of the chorus keeping the theme of death, light and dreaming. While we were in the studio Will had a dream about Taylor Swift singing a song called ‘Jordi’ and that became the muse of the songs verses. One of my favorite moments from making this record was when we recorded the yelling section of this song. Will just got on the mic at random and started recording the loudest howl. I was like ‘this is psycho…wtf is he doing in there…’ As soon as he finished, he came out of the booth, looked at me and said, ‘Ok, now your turn.’ The ending vocal was a one-take track based on the day that my friend died. He was on vacation and he texted me he was coming home the next day and he never did.”Take a listen to all the howling below.Previously previewed with the singles “Method Man” and “They’ll Never”, Midnight is due out June 7th. Chura will support the effort on full summer tour, and you can find tickets here.",articles40,"['Stef Chura’s', 'Chura', 'Chura’s', 'Chura’s', 'Taylor Swift', 'Chura']"
"Chance the Rapper isn’t just working hard on bringing Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets back, he’s also putting together a new album. The beloved Chicago MC has been hinting all year that a follow-up to 2016’s Coloring Book would be coming this July. As proof of concept, he’s now shared a snippet of a new track via Instagram.The song was previously hinted at back in April, but the more recent post features a much more fleshed out preview. Playfully calling the upcoming effort his “owbum,” Chance posted a video featuring social media notables 8jency and Walter Bowser, as well as Texas rapper TisaKorean, who features on the unnamed tune. The four of them dance-mime the lyrics like, “Carry all the groceries in in one trip/ Simply Minute Maid, gone in one sip/ Too much dip on my chip.”In that April post, Chance said that the beat came from Murda Beatz. Listen to the teaser and watch all the moves below.Update – May 16th: Chance’s new track, “GRoCERIES”, will be released tonight. Listen to it here.For more new sounds from Chance, revisit his recent releases “My Own Thing” (featuring Joey Purp), “The Man Has Everything”, his Lil Yachty collaboration “Atlanta House Freestyle”,  “Work Out”, and “I Might Need Security”.

"French DJ/producer Sebastian released his debut album, Total, eight years ago this month. Now, he’s finally ready to drop its follow-up.Due out through longtime label Ed Banger Records/Because Music, the as-yet-untitled record is due to arrive this fall. In addition to Total, the project comes after Sebastian’s production work for folks like Frank Ocean (Blonde) and Charlotte Gainsbourg (Take 2 EP), as well as remixes of Daft Punk and Beastie Boys.To preview the forthcoming LP, Sebastian has shared “Run for Me”. It’s a funky yet smooth tune, and features guest vocals from CoSigned R&B crooner Gallant.“We made it in one day, in one take without stopping,” Sebastian explained in a statement. “The melody evolved wherever it seemed to want to go all by itself. I tracked Gallant down for the vocals because he shared the same power and logic that the song aimed to have and I wasn’t disappointed. The song really came into its own when the vocals were laid down on the track.”Check out “Run for Me” below via its video, directed by Todd Tourso (Beyoncé, Rihanna).Sebastian is scheduled to perform at a number of festivals this summer, including We Love Green in France, Belgium’s Dour Festival, Sónar Festival in Barcelona, and Montreal’s Osheaga Festival.",articles40,"['Total', 'Sebastian’s', 'Daft Punk', 'Beastie Boys', '“We', 'We Love Green']"
"It’s been 15 years since the veteran metal quartet Torche formed, and it looks like the band is going big to celebrate.Torche announced today that they are back with their first new album in four years, Admission, which follows up 2015’s crushing Restarter. The 11-song full-length will be out on July 12th via Relapse Records. Expect some changes, too. The most notable difference is that Torche bassist Jon Nuñez has moved over to guitar, allowing Eric Hernandez (formerly of Wrong) to slip into his place on bass. Nuñez is also credited as the album’s producer.(Read: Torche: The Making of a Sonic Bulldozer)With the news comes lead single “Slide”. It’s a sweltering song, the kind that goes hard on sludge bass and piercing drums, where every note feels heavier than the last. Yet as intense as it is, Torche still keep it moving forward with a bit of alt-rock air. Listen to it below to hear it for yourself.Perhaps the reason it feels like a modern take on their old sound is because the song was written by Hernandez, their new member. “’Slide’ is one of the first songs Eric came to the table with, fully realized and arranged,” drummer Rick Smith says in a press release. “Eric is a total beast of a songwriter. I suggested he use the first three Gary Numan records as inspiration and he came back at us with some melodically sound material that nailed the Torche vibe.”All of this bodes well for whatever Admission has in store.

"Newly signed to Mom + Pop/Ninja Tune, Tycho have announced a new album, Weather. The full-length follow-up to 2016’s Epoch is due out July 12th.Marking the project’s fifth LP overall, Weather finds Tycho’s primary producer/songwriter Scott Hansen actively evolving his sound. As each record built on the compositions that came before it, this new one sees an additional focus on vocals. While early single “Easy” featured mostly skittering electronics, the newly revealed “Pink & Blue” brings lyrics to the forefront.“Pink & Blue” is one of five songs on the eight-track effort that features Saint Sinner, who penned the lyrics herself. Speaking of the new single in a press release, she said,“The lines, ‘Oh, pink and blue, you know I look good on you,’ originally stemmed from when I was romantically involved with a man and a woman simultaneously, for the first time in my life. It was a defining moment for me. I went from being a young religious kid who thought she would marry a man to a young woman who realized her love for women. I now found myself, somewhere in the middle, leaning more closely to women. ‘Pink & Blue’ is a love song to no one, to everyone, and to myself. It’s a sweet reminder to all lovers to hold onto their love with open arms; to be fearless about any type of love and to be fearless about losing their love. Love is never lost.”Take a listen via the “Pink & Blue” music video below. Directed by Chloe Corner and starring Saint Sinner herself, Hannah Cottrell, the clip marks the first visual Hansen has been “intimately involved with producing,” earning him a Creative Director credit.Pre-orders for Weather are going on now.

"Believe it or not, it’s been over a decade since the Silver Jews decided to call it quits. With the exception of archival releases and reissues, there hasn’t been much activity from the band’s members in that time — that is until now.David Berman has launched his first post-Silver Jews project today, as Stereogum points out. His group is called Purple Mountains, named after his blog, and they’re introducing themselves with debut single “All My Happiness is Gone”.His first new music release since the Silver Jews’ Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea in 2008, the single is featured on a 12-inch. It was recorded at Jamdek in Chicago and comes alongside two additional remixes titled “All My Happiness is Wrong” and “All My Happiness is Long”. Song credits suggest the new band is rounded out by three members of the group Woods and Anna St. Louis.(Read: Dusting ‘Em Off: Silver Jews — American Water) Due out via longtime label Drag City, the 12-inch single is only available at record stores and, per an included message (seen below), will never be released digitally. The good news? The same message assures fans that a proper Purple Mountains album is on the way in a “couple months”:“all my happiness is gone” is the debut 12″ single from purple mountains, featuring david at the height of his powers. let’s stop the world together, shall we? then check out the remixes. the full album is still a couple months away; until then, we’ve made this to bring people into your stores — so please don’t sell them online. sell them “they-o–a–they-o” instead. we want people in your store on non-rsd days too!Update – May 13th: You can hear a recording of “All My Happiness is Long” on the latest episode of WHUP’s Downhill Swing.

"The return of FKA twigs is complete. After sharing her new single “Cellophane”, the musician/dancer/artist recently kicked off her “Magdalene Tour”, her first concerts in almost three years. During the opening performances at Los Angeles’ Palace Theatre and New York City’s Park Armory, the British alt-R&B star debuted a number of new songs.Considering the material was being premiered for the first time, it’s hard to judge exactly what was played. However, a Rolling Stone review of the May 11th show in NYC states that “at least seven new songs” were performed. Over at Setlist.fm, a setlist for the May 8th LA gig (the only of FKA’s recent shows with a completed setlist) lists titles like “1000 Eyes”, “Mary Magdalene”, “Sad Day”, and “Day Bed”.(Read: 20 Music Festivals You Don’t Want to Miss in 2019)A number of videos featuring the new music have also come online, some bearing track names like “Lonely”, “Make a Wish”, and “Home with You”.

A limited amount of vinyl copies were made available for Record Store Day last month, but a wide release isn’t slated until July 12th. Now, though, in celebration of Mother’s Day, Tweedy is streaming the album in full on Wilco’s website.WARMER comes from the same sessions as WARM, recorded at Wilco’s The Loft studio in Chicago. “At some point I separated the songs from the WARM/WARMER session into two records with individual character, but still tried to keep the overall tone and texture of the combined session consistent,” Tweedy explains in a statement. “In a lot of ways these two records could have been released as a double LP. WARMER means as much to me as WARM and might just as easily have been released as the first record of the pair.”In related news, Tweedy is set to appear on the next season of Curb Your Enthusasiam.WARMER Artwork:WARMER Tracklist:

"Combichrist, the industrial metal act based out of Atlanta and featuring Norwegian frontman Andy LaPlegua, will return with a new album, One Fire, on June 7th, and they’ve just unleashed an intense video for the new song “Understand” (watch below).The band has been the brainchild of LaPlegua for 15 years now, as he has fronted a rotating cast of musicians over the years. One Fire marks the band’s ninth album, and will be released via Out of Line Music.(Buy: Tickets to Combichrist’s US Tour Dates)Regarding the David Lynch-inspired video for “Understand”, LaPlegua stated, “This might be the most important music video I’ve ever made. I’m addressing themes and personal feelings that to date I’ve kept hidden. Anxiety, fear, the unknown, and how they take a toll on people’s lives, on my life. This is the third video I’ve made with director Jason Alacrity, and his ability to translate these wild impulses and different ideas was a great challenge. But he, and the cast, really did an amazing job making the song come to life in an even more intense way. ‘Understand’ isn’t just about knowing, it’s about learning.”Combichrist are currently on a North American tour with Silver Snakes.

"Over the last few months, New York hip-hop collective Beast Coast has been gaining momentum. After recently releasing two singles (“Left Hand” and “Coast/Clear”), announcing their first-ever tour, and premiering on late-night TV, the group has now announced their debut album.The forthcoming LP, Escape From New York, is due out on May 24th via Columbia.

"Seemingly out of nowhere, Volbeat unleashed a brand-new song called “Parasite” today (May 10th). What’s even more surprising is that the track is only 37 seconds long.At first it seemed like the YouTube lyric video (below) was just a snippet of the song, but the full track is available for download and streaming at Spotify, Apple, and other services, and clocks in at just 37 seconds on those platforms, as well. We also contacted the band’s management, and confirmed that the song is indeed that length.“Parasite” has an anthemic punk-like vibe, and is over before you know it, perhaps serving as a taste of what’s to come on the band’s next album. While no details on Volbeat’s new LP have been unveiled yet, guitarist Rob Caggiano told us late last year that “the plan is to release the album [in 2019] and tour as much as possible.”As for touring, Volbeat will join Slipknot on their “Knotfest Roadshow” North American tour this summer.

"Before his death last year, Swedish producer Avicii (né Tim Bergling) was in the final stages of completing a new album. Now, thanks to friends and collaborators, that project, simply titled TIM, will see an official release on June 6th.Fans received an early listen with April’s “SOS” featuring Aloe Blacc. Today brings a second preview in “Tough Love”. The track was produced and written by Avicii alongside Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir (Vargas & Lagola), who’d previously worked with the global producer on past cuts like “Hey Brother” and “Without You”.According to a statement, “Tough Love” features a melody loop inspired by Avicii’s trip to India. “Oddly enough, the Indian influences fit perfectly into a song we were working on, something that was so typical of Tim,” Pontare said in a statement. “He was a melodic genius.”(Read: 10 Songs That Get Real About Mental Health)Avicii passed away having finished about 80% of the track, but left notes on how he envisioned it eventually turning out. “This one needs to be a duet,” his notes read. “Coolest thing would be a real couple. Or a couple that have worked together enough to be almost considered a couple!”Fulfilling Avicii’s wishes, Pontare enlisted his wife, Swedish artist Agnes, to sing with him on the final version, which is an engaging, whirlwind of a number.Check out “Tough Love” below, followed by a “making of” video.TIM follows Stories from 2015. Along with helping to put out the album, the producer’s family launched a foundation dedicated to mental health and suicide prevention on the one-year anniversary of Avicii’s death.Avicii’s body was found on April 20th, 2018 in Muscat, Oman, where he had been on vacation. An autopsy later revealed that the 28-year-old artist had taken his own life.",articles40,"['Tim Bergling', 'Today', 'Avicii’s']"

"Track by Track is a recurring new music feature in which we task an artist to give some in depth insight into their latest full-length release, one track at a time.Charly Bliss have today debuted their sophomore album, Young Enough. Stream the entire thing below via Apple Music or Spotify.The follow-up to 2017’s Guppy, Young Enough was recorded with producer Joe Chiccarelli (The Shins, The White Stripes). Entering the studio after releasing their breakout debut, the New York power pop act were determined not to repeat their sound. They assured that by tapping into a newfound confidence in songwriting, even as their songs again dealt with framing “the darkest lyrics in the context of upbeat songs.”(Read: 20 Essential SXSW Acts to Catch on Tour This Spring)Frontwoman Eva Hendricks used the album to work through her personal traumas, like the sexual assault she confronts on “Chatroom” or the struggle to break with such an abusive relationship on “Hard to Believe”. The record’s lead single, “Capacity”, finds her fighting for self-reclamation, emancipating herself from the BS of other people and her own damaging internal dialogue.Take a listen to the full thing below, and get tickets to Charly Bliss’ current tour here.For more on what went into Young Enough, Hendricks has broken down the album Track by Track.“Blown to Bits”:
I started writing this song the day that everyone in Hawaii was alerted to a nuclear missile headed their way. Luckily it ended up being a false alarm, but that day I couldn’t stop thinking about actually living out the end of your world, and THE world, and how devastated I would be by the loss of things that are for the most part, really simple and small. To me, this bizarre event and the feelings of panic and global mistrust that ensued also echoed all of the horrible events that have taken place politically in our country in the past several years. This is a love song to little moments that make me feel like we might make it out the other end.“Capacity”:
Our anti-people-pleaser anthem! I’ve always framed this song negatively, as in, it’s about wanting to kill off this self-sacrificing part of my personality that I really despise, but if I frame it positively, it’s about learning to trust your gut, especially when your gut is telling you that there is a tremendous amount of bullshit clogging your brain and draining you of your life-force and the things that make you like and respect yourself! It is so cool and feels so good to say no!“Under You”:
At first glance, a total mush of a song about the magic of falling in love with somebody who has what it takes to love you back right. Also a song about how bizarre it is that all relationships, regardless of how they’ll turn out, start out that way — bubbling, beautiful, thrilling; even if they end horribly and briefly destroy your life.“Camera”:
I wrote this while I was on hold with TD Bank because my credit card was stolen by someone who had used $556 to buy a camera at B&H. It made me think about how big and random the world is, and how maybe this person had a really good idea for a movie that they were determined to make by any means necessary (we made the “Westermarck” video for $40, I can relate to this!), and I was totally ruining their brilliant idea by alerting my bank and closing the card. Then I got sad thinking about how unlikely that is, and how they were probably just going to re-sell it or use it for something really fucked up and awful.“Fighting in the Dark”:
This is the last song that was written for this album. I wrote the lyrics after a really brutal but ultimately positive therapy session in which I felt that I had finally wrapped my head around certain aspects of this experience with sexual assault that had previously felt impossible for me to understand or face. Originally, I wrote it as a bridge to a song that didn’t make the cut, but the lyrics felt like the perfect final word on the subject matter for this album and I’m so glad that it made it on as a sort of emotional interlude from one thematic portion of the record to the next.“Young Enough”:
We all love this one. I’ll never forget when Sam [Hendricks] came to me and said, “I have an idea for a song that has one chord that never changes all the way through it and for some reason I know it’s going to be the best song on the album.” I was ready to strangle him when he told me this because it felt like he was giving me literally nothing to go off of, and all the pressure in the world was on our shoulders as we started fleshing it out! But as soon as I heard his first demo, I completely agreed. I wanted to help out and just not fuck it up on this one. Simultaneously, it felt like there was some weird, sibling magic that was leading the way while we wrote it. We both knew when something wasn’t quite right even when we didn’t know what could fix it, and we both knew when to drive and when to step back.Lyrically, this song is the centerpiece of the album. I can’t help but hear it as proof of how much we’ve grown and I’ve grown since our first album. This song and nearly all of the songs on Guppy are about the first time that I fell in love. When we were writing Guppy, I felt so frustrated and furious about all of the reasons why that relationship didn’t work out, and the songs clearly reflect that. However, Young Enough as an album is about a different relationship, one that was sinister and damaging and abusive, and it gave me a lot perspective. It’s kind of a total privilege to have your first major relationship be with someone who absolutely loves you but just can’t get it together to give you what you need, and vice versa. This song is about feeling nostalgic for a moment in your life when you really believed in the teen-drama, Twilight-era trope wherein a relationship being painful meant that it was worth it. It’s about feeling grateful that someone tried to love you as best they could, and simultaneously feeling even more grateful that you don’t buy into that anymore and you’ve made it out the other side.“Bleach”:
This is a song about trying to hold onto hope and things that are beautiful when the world feels like a political nightmare hell-scape. The song is supposed to feel like an intertwining explosion of melody that serves as a release after the build of “Young Enough.”“Chatroom”:
I was sexually assaulted by someone that I dated and it took me years to admit it to myself and then sort out my feelings and stop blaming myself for it. Listening to “Chatroom” makes me feel strong. I think of it as a joyful song about removing toxic waste and garbage-people from your life. The bridge lyrics, “I am trusting/ Well-adjusted/ Marked me dormant/ I erupted…” always make me cry. Part of healing is admitting that something really awful happened to you, and not avoiding it or sugar-coating the facts. At the same time, it feels really powerful to say that in spite of what happened, I still really like myself, and this person’s actions didn’t destroy any of the fundamental aspects of who I am.“Hurt Me”:
Another Young Enough buzzer-beater! I had been listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen, specifically the song “For You” and I thought about how I really wanted there to be a more intimate moment on the record. We had also just seen Lorde on her Melodrama tour and loved how the song “Liability” felt like such a perfectly placed outlier in her set. Stylistically, this song is maybe the biggest departure for us, but I love the dynamics and diversity that it brings to the album. This song is about loving someone even after they give you a million reasons not to.“Hard to Believe”:
I just remember Sam showing us this guitar riff that he had thought of and we used to end every band practice by doing it over and over again because it was so fun to play. It took us way too long to finally turn it into a full song, but I still feel just as thrilled playing that riff whenever we perform it live.“The Truth”:
Without a doubt one of my favorite songs on the album. Originally, the chorus to this song was totally different, and the lyric was “all I can do is tell the truth,” which was sort of my mantra when we were writing Young Enough. However, the melody I’d written wasn’t working, so Sam came in and totally rewrote the chorus and made it a zillion times better. Regardless, I think the spirit of the song is still the same. It’s so hyper-specific and detailed that it almost hurts to listen to it, but melodically and instrumentally, “The Truth” feels like a triumph, and therefore the perfect note to end the album on.",articles40,"['Track', 'Charly Bliss', 'Young Enough', 'The White Stripes', 'Young Enough', 'Track', 'Luckily', '…', 'Bruce Springsteen', 'Young Enough']"
"Jamila Woods has finally revealed her new album, LEGACY! LEGACY!, through Jagjaguwar/Closed Sessions. It’s available to stream in full below via Apple Music or Spotify.Her second full-length to date following 2016’s HEAVN is inspired by people who have made a lasting impact on Woods. Each of the 13 songs is named after one of these beloved individuals.There are references to playwright and social critic Jimmy Baldwin (“Baldwin”); famed artist Jean-Michel Basquiat; actress/activist Eartha Kitt (“Eartha”), and poet Nikki Giovanni on “Giovanni”, the early single that eventually was crowned one of the best songs of 2018 by Consequence of Sound.(Read: Song of the Week: Jamila Woods Lifts Us Up with Empowerment Jam “Giovanni”)“More than just giving the song titles the names of historical black and brown icons of literature, art, and music, Jamila Woods builds a sonic and lyrical monument to the various modes of how these icons tried to push beyond the margins a country had assigned to them,” reads a new bio on Woods, penned by poet Hanif Abdurraqib.Assisting the R&B singer on the powerful LEGACY! LEGACY! are a number of fellow Chicagoans such as Nico Segal of The Social Experiment, theMIND, Jasminfire, Nitty Scott, and Saba. Production was handled by past collaborator Oddcouple alongside Chance the Rapper associate Peter Cottontale, and rising artist Slot-A.To support the new record, Woods will embark on North American tour later this month, tickets for which can be bought here.LEGACY!

"Dark Morph, the new group featuring Sigur Rós frontman Jónsi and Swedish composer and visual artist Carl Michael von Hausswolff, have released their self-titled debut album. It’s streaming in its entirety below through Apple Music and Spotify.Due out via Krunk/The Vinyl Factory, the eight-track effort was developed as part of a fellowship and residency program at TBA21-Academy, an organization “dedicated to fostering a deeper understanding of the ocean through the lens of art and to engendering creative solutions to its most pressing issues.” Incorporated throughout are field recordings of humpback whales, bats, dark morph herons, and other creatures which were collected at the Vanua Vatu Reef in Fiji.(Read: Did Vampire Weekend Win the Indie Rock Age?)In a previous statement, von Hausswolff discussed the process of obtaining all of the album’s unique sounds:“While we were on the boat I started to take the recordings, manipulate them and mutate them into drones or other types of musical functions — so we could use the sounds as instruments for building compositions. We decided, “Let’s try not to have them sounding too much like real sounds, let’s turn them into something else.” When I had done some drones, some long tones out of a bird or something, I gave it to Jónsi and he started to peel off certain types of melodious things, and then play it to me. And then we started to just throw the ball back and forth.”To celebrate the new LP, Jónsi and von Hausswolff are scheduled to play a free album show in Venice’s Ocean Space museum Friday, May 10th. The duo’s music will also be showcased as an audio installation at the museum from May 7th through June 30th. For more information on both events, head here.Next month will also see Jónsi and his partner/collaborator Alex Somers launch a tour celebrating the 10th anniversary of their collaborative 2009 album, Riceboy Sleeps. Following summer dates in the UK and Europe, the pair will then bring the trek to the US in October. Purchase your tickets here.Dark Morph Artwork:Dark Morph Tracklist:

"Mac DeMarco is back, friendo. The slacker rocker has today released his latest album, Here Comes the Cowboy. Stream it now below via Apple Music and Spotify.Marking DeMarco’s fourth full-length overall, Cowboy follows 2017’s This Old Dog. Recorded at DeMarco’s own Jizz Jazz Studios in Los Angeles, nearly all of the instruments on the effort were played by the musician himself, save for a few keyboard contributions from touring bandmate Alec Meen.(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)The announcement of Here Comes the Cowboy was met with immediate controversy as many pointed out the ironic similarity between its title and the title of Mitski’s most recent record, Be the Cowboy. Even more, both records feature a single called “Nobody”. However, both artists have spoken on the issue, with Mitski tweeting, “I’m 100% sure mac & I just went fishing in the same part of the collective unconscious!”DeMarco, meanwhile, claimed to have never heard Mitski’s album, and later said he wasn’t trying to “troll” her. “Even if I had known, I don’t think I would’ve changed it,” he said, adding that Mitski expressed her own shock at how people stirred controversy. “I didn’t think people were gonna run with it that far. It’s ridiculous. It’s just music.”Other singles included “All of Our Yesterdays” and “On the Square”. Stream the full LP below, and catch DeMarco on tour by finding tickets here.Update: Watch the new music video for “Here Comes the Cowboy”. Directed by Cole Kush, the animated clip might actually be more jarring than the one for “On the Square”, which saw DeMarco get “intimate” with… milk. There are alien-like creatures plastered with the creepiest of grins, Jim Carrey’s The Mask character masked as a, uhh, park ranger, a manic and flying emoji, and so much more potential stuff for your nightmares.

"Madonna has always been about her chameleonic pop tendencies, and her forthcoming Madame X seems chock full of prime examples. She went Latin on the Maluma-featuring “Medellín”, then got political with “I Rise”. Now, the Queen of Pop is dipping into hip-hop with her latest single, “Crave”.A collaboration with Rae Sremmurd’s Swae Lee, the track is built of the skittering, laid-back percussion of your typical hip-hop cut.

"Two years ago, Death Cab for Cutie’s Ben Gibbard put his own spin on  Bandwagonesque, the ’90s-era album from alternative outfit Teenage Fanclub. The indie frontman has returned today with a new cover — but this time he’s reworking hardcore punk.Gibbard took to SoundCloud to upload a piano-led rendition of “Filler”, the opening track to Minor Threat’s debut EP. While the original 1981 cut could demolish speakers with its harshness, Gibbard’s take is all tenderness (yes, even on the hook when he calmy sings “You’re full of sh*t”).(Read: Five Reasons Death Cab For Cutie’s Transatlanticism Should Be Everyone’s Favorite)“I covered this only once at a solo show in D.C. in 2012,” Gibbard wrote on SoundCloud. “I felt like recording and sharing it today. enjoy.”Enjoy it down below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Here’s Minor Threat’s original for comparison:Death Cab for Cutie recently celebrated the 15th anniversary of their classic record Transatlanticism.

It’s called “Pups” and can be streamed in full below.Over hyped up production, the ASAP Mob members reference Barack Obama, Wu-Tang Clan, Sheck Wes, and George Pataki, former governor of New York. Past collaborator Frankie P produced the track at the Polo Grounds Music Studios and Electric Lady Studios in New York.

"Over the summer last year, Roger Daltrey and his band performed a few shows where they played The Who’s classic album Tommy with the help of symphony orchestras. It was an experience that Daltrey described as “magical” — and now listeners everywhere will be able to hear why.To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Tommy, Daltrey teamed up with composer and arranger David Campbell (Adele, Radiohead, Bob Dylan, Metallica, etc) for The Who’s Tommy Orchestral, an orchestral reimagining of the iconic album. The album was recorded in Budapest and Bethel in upstate New York — where the first Woodstock took place. It was produced by Daltrey and Keith Levenson, who worked on the touring version of the Tommy Musical. Of course, there backing Daltrey up are core touring band members: singer-guitarist Simon Townshend, guitarist Frank Simes, drummer Scott Devours, bassist Jon Button, and keyboardist Loren Gold.(Listen: Discography: A Who Audio Podcast)“Pete [Townshend]’s music is particularly suited to being embellished by the sounds that an orchestra can add to the band,” explains Daltrey in a press release. “Tommy can mean whatever you want it to mean; I use the characters in it as metaphors for parts of the human condition, so it’s a kind of a story of the human spirit. Even though it is 50 years on, I approach it as though I’m singing it for the first time.”You can catch a glimpse of that in the rendition of “Pinball Wizard” they’ve shared from The Who’s Tommy Orchestral. Daltrey’s voice sounds incredibly sturdy and full, as it should after the surgery he’s gone through to preserve it. Horns flare up around him, punching up the song. It’s the beautiful use of strings replacing guitar solos, though, that steals the spotlight, giving a new sound to a classic rock classic without steering too far from the original. Give it a listen below ahead of the album’s June 14th release.The news of this orchestral album is a cherry on top of an already fantastic year for fans of The Who. At the start of 2019, Townshend and Daltrey told Rolling Stone that a new studio album was in the works — their first since 2006’s Endless Wire. The album is full of “dark ballads, heavy rock stuff, experimental electronica, sampled stuff and cliched Who-ish tunes that began with a guitar that goes yanga-dang.”On top of that, The Who are also going on an extensive tour of North America this year. The tour, called the “Moving On! Tour”, sees the band performing at 29 stops across the US and Canada with an orchestra in tow. That last bit makes more sense with this new album announcement. Get ready to hear Tommy tracks and more sound a bit sweeter with some strings.

"Origins is a recurring feature that gives artists the chance to dig into the various inspirations behind their latest song.There are generally two reactions to running into an ex. The first comes if you’re really back on your feet post-breakup, moving along confidently in your new direction; that’s when you up the charming nonchalance, stretching that smile to the brink. On the other hand, if you’re not really over the split, that labored smile feels pinned back, a shaky crescent that could collapse around your pleasantries at any moment.Now imagine going through that second series of emotions when you bump into a former lover whose arms are around your one-time best friend. That’s when you’re really forced to shield your pride with a facade of civility. In her new duet with Langhorne Slim, Los Angeles singer-songwriter Mara Connor seeks to peel back that pretense to reveal the pain underneath.Her sophomore single following last year’s “No Fun” and the debut release from Side Hustle Records (PR company Big Hassle’s new record label), “Someone New” was written after Connor really did confront an ex-boyfriend and his new lover, her former best friend. Connor and Langhorne take opposite perspectives in the melancholy duet. Where Connor’s character is wrestling with her heartbreak (“Oh these days of you just won’t quit”), Langhorne’s is sorrowfully wishing she can find a way to move on (“Say goodbye to these eyes that cut through you/ To the eyes you will yearn to forget”).Take a listen to “Someone New” via it’s accompanying in-studio music video, which was co-directed by Mara and her mom, Kate Connor.For more on the story — and other musical influences — that led to “Someone New”, Connor has broken down the song’s Origins.Running into an Ex:I wrote “Someone New” after running into an ex at a party with his new girlfriend. He was my first “love” and she was my first “best friend” and now we were practically strangers exchanging pleasantries at a crowded party. I wrote the song about the charade of it all… the mask we wear to protect our pride, and the pain and longing that hides just beneath the surface. It’s a back-and-forth between the inner monologues of two people unable to say what’s really on their minds.Blake Mills — Break Mirrors:Blake Mills’ debut album Break Mirrors was a formative record for me. I got into it in college when my friend convinced me to blow all my money on a trip to Paris with her over winter break. But when we got to Paris, we realized it was freezing, so instead of going out and exploring the city at night, we turned in early and listened to records. She put on Break Mirrors and it knocked me out. I’ll never forget that cold winter night in Paris… Hearing this raw, honest, virtuosic Southern California songwriter. It heavily influenced the music I started making. I brought it into the studio as a reference for “Someone New.”Cass McCombs — “Country Line”:I was listening to Cass McCombs’ “County Line”, one of my favorite breakup songs. Crossing that “county line” is the perfect metaphor for revisiting a broken relationship. There’s a resign to it that is so palpable and deeply sad. I guess most of my favorite songs are little emotional time capsules like that.Riding the Metro North:“Someone New” was the first song I wrote for my album. I was a senior in college living in the East Village in my first apartment, working at a record label in Brooklyn and commuting twice a week to upstate New York to finish my degree at Vassar. I had to wake up at 6:00 a.m. to take the Metro North along the Hudson River. It was February. The river was frozen, the trees were bare with spiny branches and I could see my breath. On those train rides I would listen to records, stare out the window across the vast white abyss and wish I were somewhere warmer. The chill of winter definitely helped inspire some sad songs like “Someone New.”Bomb Shelter in East Nashville:We recorded most of the track live to tape at the Bomb Shelter in East Nashville, Langhorne and I singing next to each other in the vocal booth while Jon and Dave played in the live tracking room. My producer Andrija brought his creative and unorthodox recording methods to the song… We recorded an acoustic guitar then put a mic up to the playback headphones to create a more unique guitar tone.",articles40,"['That’s', 'Langhorne’s', 'Mara', 'Blake Mills', 'Blake Mills’', '”Bomb Shelter', 'East Nashville', 'Jon and']"
"The New Negroes is a new Comedy Centra series from rapper Open Mike Eagle and comedian Baron Vaughn. Along with socially aware stand-up sets, the variety show features a new musical collaboration each week.Previously, we saw OME link up with MF DOOM (“Police Myself”), Danny Brown (“Unfiltered”), and Phonte (“Woke as Me”). This week’s installment has now brought together OME and the R&B goddess Lizzo for a new song called “Extra Consent”.(Read: 10 Female Rappers You Should Definitely Know About)As its title suggests, the offering is all about the importance of receiving permission when it comes to sexual relations. OME talked further about the track and Lizzo’s contributions in a statement:“It was amazing working with Lizzo on this song. She brought an incredible visceral energy to balance my cerebral approach to the subject matter. When I brought her the song I asked her to respond to my verse with whatever her real reaction would be if she were in that situation. It was very important to me to have a strong female voice to provide perspective on this song given that historically women have been the gender group most affected by the notion of clarity around consent. Apologies in advance to anyone for whom this is a sensitive subject.”Check out the video for “Extra Consent”, in which OME presents Lizzo with an actual contract of consent.The new episode of New Negroes airs Friday, May 10th.As for Lizzo, she recently expanded her tour in support of the near-flawless Cuz I Love You.

"As Will Smith revealed on his recent Fallon appearance, a lot of Disney’s live-action remake of Aladdin is going to hinge on updating the classic songs. That includes the enduring single “A Whole New World”, which won Song of the Year at the 1994 Grammys. While that version was sung by Regina Belle and Peabo Bryson (who’s currently recuperating after a heart attack), Disney went a little poppier for the 2018 rendition.The Mouse House tapped former 1Der Zayn and young R&B pop riser Zhavia Ward for the update. Unfortunately, overblown production and attempts to gussy up perfection with “tricky” vocal runs end up stripping the song of its delicate magic. The video doesn’t really help matters, for some reason separating its protagonists in irrelevant New York City locations as they sing about starting a loving adventure together.(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Family Movies of 2019)Of course, it’s still probably going to do huge numbers, and will likely play during the end credits of the film. If Disney gets even a fraction of the original’s ubiquity out of it, it’ll be considered a successful cover, even if it doesn’t wind up with awards show recognition.Listen for yourself below.Directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Smith, Mena Massoud, Naomi Scott, Marwan Kenzari, and Navid Negahban, Aladdin soars into theaters on May 24th.",articles40,"['Disney’s', 'Zayn', 'Directed', 'Naomi Scott', 'Navid Negahban', 'Aladdin']"

CRJ’s gonna drop five.Yes, with her new album, Dedicated, due out next week, the Canadian pop darling has returned with yet another listen to the effort. Entitled “Too Much”, the song serves as the center-point of the LP, falling right in the middle of the tracklist. It’s a relatively minimalist electropop groove that finds Jepsen singing of her habit of going all in, for better or worse: “I’ll do anything to get to the rush/ Now I’m dancing, and I’m dancing too much/ So be careful if you’re wanting this touch/ ‘Cause if I love you, then I love you too much.”(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Pop Albums of 2019)Take a listen below.“Too Much” follows “Now That I Found You”, “No Drug Like Me”, “Julien”, and “Party for One”, the latter of which was one of our favorite songs of 2018 and lives only as a bonus track.

"It’s been six years since Ne-Hi formed, but as of today, the garage rock quartet born from Chicago’s DIY scene is calling it quits.Members Alex Otake, James Weir, Jason Balla, and Mikey Wells formed the band back in 2013 and quickly found their way as a lively onstage act. The band released two full-lengths, 2014’s self-titled LP and 2017’s OFFERS, as well as a handful of singles.Ne-Hi took to social media to spread the news of their breakup. “We just want to say THANK YOU to everyone for the incredible support we’ve gotten from day one,” the band writes. “From starting in the basement of Animal Kingdom to Pitchfork and beyond this whole journey has been better than we ever could have imagined.” See the full message below.To celebrate their end, Ne-Hi also announced a brand new EP, XYZ, which is already available to stream. The EP includes three tracks: “Exit Stations”, “Money”, and “Highways”.XYZ sees Ne-Hi entering a slightly more new wave era to wave goodbye from. “Exit Stations” recalls ‘80s-era Tom Petty while slow burning “Money” and the skittering “Highways” feel on par with the Chicago band’s usual poppy DIY sound.

"Blink-182 are expected to deliver a new album this year, their first since California. Now, the pop punk veterans have shared its lead single, “Blame It on My Youth”.At times bouncy and anthemic, the track sees Blink-182 reminiscing about their modest childhoods and how they came to start a band. “I wasn’t born with the rich blood/ I started out with plenty of nothing at all,” Matt Skiba sings early on. “I got stuck in the thick mud/ The flash flood, punk rock, and the alcohol.” Take a listen below.(Read: The 100 Best Pop Punk Bands)Today’s new song comes just days after the three-piece announced a co-headlining tour with… Lil Wayne. You can get tickets here.In an interview earlier this spring, Mark Hoppus explained that the new album would be “very different” from its predecessor,“It’s a lot more aggressive. It’s darker in theme and tone. If you like California to Enema Of The State then this album is more like the untitled record where we are trying to experiment more: trying to experiment more, trying different sounds, and trying to expand upon what people think Blink-182 is.”In the time since 2016’s California, Hoppus has launched Simple Creatures, a new collaborative project with All Time Low’s Alex Gaskarth, while longtime drummer Travis Barker has recovered from his blood clots. (Ex-member Tom DeLonge has, of course, continued his search for aliens.)“Blame It on My Youth” Artwork:",articles40,"['Lil Wayne', 'Mark Hoppus', 'Travis Barker', 'Tom DeLonge']"
"Origins is a recurring feature that lets artists dig into the various inspirations behind their latest music.At the end of the week, Mikal Cronin will release a new two-song 7-inch, his first solo effort in some time. His last album was 2015’s MCIII, but that’s not to say that the California rocker has been absent from the scene since then. Rather, the “Weight” crooner has always been a prolific creator, though he frequently shares his talents with his collaborators like Ty Segall and Kim Gordon.But it’s good to have his voice front and center again. Back in March, Cronin released “Undertow”, which makes up one half of his forthcoming 7-inch. Now, ahead of the vinyl’s release this Friday, May 10th via Brooklyn-based bedroom label Famous Class, the singer has released the B-side, “Breathe”. Recorded live (for the first time in his career, no less) with a handful of his musical friends, the effort was captured by Jason Quever during an intimate winter 2018 session in Los Angeles.(Read: In the Red Records: 25 Years of Punk, Garage, Fuzz, and Scuzz)In a statement, Cronin explained,“It’s easy to get caught up in an undertow, pulled down into the water, weightless and directionless. The current stirs and you lose your way. But eventually, if you’re lucky and patient, you can float back up to the surface and take a breath. This is my first new music in a while — my gulp of air. Many talented friends joined me, the basic tracks were recorded live together for the first time in my recording career. This felt good… Thanks for listening.”Hear “Breathe” below.<a href=""http://mikalcronin.bandcamp.com/album/undertow-breathe"">Undertow / Breathe by Mikal Cronin</a>In addition to sharing the track, Cronin has explained the Origins of “Breathe”, highlighting how Grecian explosions, whistling tea kettles, and a MOOG Sub 37 all came together to shape the track. Read on below, and pick up your copy of “Undertow”/”Breathe” in a variety of vinyl colors — including the newly announced silver — at Famous Class.Athens, Greece:I wrote the core of this song in Athens, Greece, while on tour with Ty Segall. I had woken up early and walked to a music shop where I found this bouzouki, which the core of the song is based around. I sat on our hotel’s balcony in the rain, figuring out the instrument and finding the song. While recording a voice memo, a huge explosion rocked the neighborhood. It was so loud that it set off all the car alarms on the street. I quickly stopped the recording and ran inside, calling my bandmates (who had just left the hotel) to make sure they were alright. Everyone was fine. People told me it could have been lightning striking nearby. I still really don’t know.MOOG:I’ve been a resident of synth city for a bit now. I knew I would fall down the rabbit hole eventually, but I mostly held off for years. A Moog Sub 37 begins the song and continues throughout — a few tracks of arpeggiating chords. I have many synth jams that will likely never see the light of day. There can be a pressure when writing my own songs to “make them good…” I don’t put the same pressure on myself in synth city. Bleep blip blop.Friends in Studio:I had never recorded my music with a live backing band until these sessions, outside of radio performances and such. Especially with a song like this, having friends come and play with me was important to the sound and vibe I was looking for. I play bouzouki and guitar, William Tyler on guitar, Marc Riordan on drums, Ryan Weinstein on bass, Jordan Katz on trumpet, and David Ralicke on trombone.Tea:I continued to work on this song in a cabin in the woods. I started boiling water for tea and went back to continue listening in the meantime. The tea kettle starting whistling over top the music in a pitch that seemed to match the track. I ran a mic line into the kitchen, recorded the tea kettle for my demo, and used the same kettle track on the final version (and added a little space echo, of course).Waking Up Too Early:I’ve long had trouble sleeping, though until recently, it had always been troubles falling asleep. These days it has switched to problems staying asleep. I’ve been waking up very early for a while now, which is sometimes very frustrating. “Some days are too long” feels to me like the anchor of my lyrics in this song.",articles40,"['Ty Segall', 'Kim Gordon', 'In the Red', 'Garage', 'Ty Segall', 'Everyone', 'Bleep', 'Especially']"
"Last year, Denzel Curry dropped his three-part, 13-track album TA1300. Now, the Florida rapper has released his first single following up last July’s LP.“Ricky” takes its name from Curry’s father, with Denzel using the track to pay tribute to his dad and explore the lessons his family passed down to him when he was younger. For example, in the chorus, he quotes his father, “Trust no man but your brothers/ And never leave your day one’s in the gutter…/ Treat young girls like your mother.” From his mother, he adds, “Trust no hoe, use a rubber.”“Ricky” was released with an accompanying music video from director Twelve’len, who collaborated with Curry on “BLACK BALLOONS”. Like the track, the visual reflects the rapper’s childhood growing up in Miami. Curry’s late brother Treon was involved in Miami’s backyard brawling scene, which was the subject of the documentary Dawg Fight. Thus, the majority of the clip was filmed in the MMA and brawling legend Dada 5000’s backyard, a spot where Treon used to compete, and features both Dada and another fighter Chocolate (both of whom appear in the 2015 film).In other news, Denzel will join Billie Eilish on North American tour starting on May 29th. After a handful of festival appearances over the summer, the rapper will meet up with the $uicideBoy$ for a tour leg that extends until late August. Find his full summer tour dates below.

"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission that put the first men on the moon. Less numerically evocative, it’s also the 36th anniversary of Brian Eno’s seminal 1983 album Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks. More in celebration of the former than the latter, an expanded reissue of Apollo featuring a whole album of new music has been announced.Due July 19th via UMe, Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks – Extended Edition will include a remaster of the original 12-track effort. The LP, which Eno wrote with his brother Roger and producer Daniel Lanois, remains one of the most enduring ambient records ever, with its songs appearing in numerous films throughout the years (Trainspotting, Drive, and 28 Days Later, to name a few). It was, however, originally created as the score to Al Reinert’s Apollo 11 documentary For All Mankind, a title which will be shared with the reissue’s additional collection of 11 new songs.(Read: 10 Brian Eno Songs That Made Films Better)A press release describes For All Mankind as “instrumental compositions that reimagine the soundtrack.” The new music finds the Eno brothers and Lanois collaborating as a trio for the first time since the original recording sessions. While most of the music is Brian Eno’s, Roger and Lanois each contributed three compositions: “Waking Up”, “Under the Moon”, and “Strange Quiet” came from Eno; and “Capsule”, “Last Step from the Surface”, and “Fine-grained” are credited to Lanois.As a taste of the fresh material, stream the single “Like I Was a Spectator” below.Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks – Extended Edition Artwork:Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks – Remastered Tracklist:

"Origins is a recurring feature that seeks to give an artist the opportunity to investigate the various inspirations behind their latest music.It took some work for Silversun Pickups to crack their new album, Widow’s Weeds. The journey to the alternative rockers’ follow-up to 2014’s Better Nature was one loaded with anxiety and loss, but the band was determined to create a record filled with resilience. All the difficulties they were facing were helping them grow as people, and they wanted their output as musicians to reflect the same.New single “Freakazoid” helped bridge that divide. Saying the track had been “been buzzing around my head for a few years” before the Pickups finally got to recording it, frontman Brian Aubert says it acted as a “portal into what would become our [new record].” As he tells Consequence of Sound, “Thematically, it’s coming from a very vulnerable place. Probably the most vulnerable on the album. The lyrics in this song are quite fundamental. It felt right to ditch the more obtuse and poetic way of expression for something blunt. However, this makes me very vulnerable about it which is a tad scary.”Though unnerving as an artist, that vulnerability is just what Aubert needed to kickstart the creation of Widow’s Weed. In “Freakazoid”, it presents itself as a smoldering examination of what its like to “believe you’re trying” in the face of chaos. Steadily determined instruments bruise their way through warm, slow strings, an unflinching grit that finds powerful release on an alternatively heavy and spacey solo. Take a listen below.Widow’s Weeds is out June 7th via the band’s own New Machine Recordings. Silversun Pickups will support the record on a summer tour, tickets for which can be found here.For more on how “Freakazoid” came together and helped push the process of the album forward, the band has broken down the song’s Origins. They’ve also included an exclusive behind-the-scenes clip, so take a look below.String Instruments:This song was written with an acoustic guitar and the string melodies in mind. After having purposefully removed anything organic on the previous albums, we knew we wanted to dive into the deep end of all things warm and wooden on this record. It clearly has a nostalgic tone to it with a little future tech sprinkled in. I left a lot of room open for Nikki to really move around and slither her way through the vocal gaps. — Brian AubertBernard Herman Scores:For the strings, we were thinking of something very classical and filmic. Kinda 1960s Bernard Herman. Something that on their own could have an emotive beginning middle and end. Butch Vig had the great idea to move through the chords on the last chorus rapidly, so that each chorus was different. So, for a pretty tight and normal arrangement, it would be constantly delivering new information. The guitar solo in this song, to me, is doing something delicate and pretty that my voice just can’t get to. — BA“More Than This” — Roxy Music:In “Freakazoid”, I got a chance to walk around and explore a warmer bass line that interplays with Bri’s singing. I’m thankful to Butch for really listening and creating a tone that worked so well with the song. To me this song is an homage to Roxy Music’s “More than This”. It’s luscious and lovely and bruised. I love the way all the instruments dance with one another in the solo and how Bri’s guitar floats through. We wanted to bring back strings and more organic sounds on this album and this song in particular seemed open for this. The strings create this willing tension throughout that grow into a frenzied chaos at the end. — Nikki MonningerThe Games Pong & Operation:The song is loaded with insecurity and desire to mend broken things together, almost as if it’s a last ditch effort to do so. There is no pessimism. There is true hope that things will be better, but trying to reach that place without the words and actions available to you to do so can feel quite destitute. Being open and vulnerable is something I’ll always have to struggle with. It reminds me of the game Operation. You’re just completely naked and at any moment something will zap. Getting to a point of complete communication has to start somewhere. Pong is that back and forth at the most basic level. — BACollaboration:I had a different approach to the drums on “Freakazoid” than how I normally approach songs. Usually we’re always looking for the geometry of the drum parts, solidifying the patterns that tend to veer towards the mechanical. But for this song I left the pattern really open and free, and focused more on the groove of the song rather than the pattern. Instead I followed the melody of the song and had that determine the drum changes so it didn’t contrast what and where the song was going, which I think created a flow which is something unique to “Freakazoid”.The very last thing I did on this track was adding the short fill on the break before the second verse. Butch and I always knew we would put a fill in that little break but I procrastinated on figuring it out, probably because it’s such a small part but somewhat important for it to be unique. It was the last drum part that needed to be done and Butch just gave me a click track and pressed record and I played a bunch of fills, 20-30 fills, trying not to think about it too much, just letting my limbs do the work. After 10 minutes or so of doing that Butch, Nikki, Joe and I listened back to all the fills and it was pretty unanimous on which fill was the one to use. Even though it was a really small part, it really captures how collaborative it was in the studio. — Christopher Guanlao",articles40,"['Silversun Pickups', 'Brian Aubert', 'Aubert', 'Widow’s Weeds', 'Bri’s', 'I’ll', 'Operation', 'Getting']"
"Earlier in the year, Damon Albarn revived Africa Express, his long-running collective dedicated to promoting African music and artists. The group released a new EP called MOLO, which featured four tracks created in collaboration with Western and African artists. Now, Africa Express have officially announced their new full-length album, EGOLI, which is due out on July 12th.The 18-track LP was recorded during a trip to South Africa last January, where the collective embarked on a week of music-making and collaboration. Recorded in Johannesburg, the collection draws its name for the Xhosa word for the city, which translates into English as “city of gold.” In addition to the Gorillaz bandleader, EGOLI sports collaborations with Super Furry Animals’ Gruff Rhys, Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Nick Zinner, Ghetts, Mr Jukes, Georgia, and others and features South African rising stars like Blk Jks, Infamous Boiz, Morena Leraba, and Maskandi guitar legend Phuzekhemisi.Said Georgia, “It was such a pleasure to be part of such a special project. This album goes far beyond just a record it is an example of the rich, modern & pioneering sounds coming out of South Africa. Absolute honour to have been involved. Africa Express is such an important platform & collective.” Moonchild Sanelly, a South African musician, added,“Being a part of such a diverse and deep musical project was so dope. We were like kids in a candy store where you just walk in to any of these crazy little studios packed with incredible musicians, and you could make any genre of music from futuristic rave to ballads with legendary stars. I loved every minute of it, and I wrote music ’til my heart was on fire.”To preview the record, Africa Express have released the album’s lead single, “Johannesburg”, which features Gruff Rhys, Morena Leraba, Radio 123, and Sibot.

"Hard rockers Lo-Pan return with their fifth full-length album, Subtle, on May 17th, and they’ve teamed up with Heavy Consequence to premiere the new track “Ascension Day” (listen below).“Ascension Day” features singer Jeff Martin’s soaring vocals over sludgy riffs, providing a nice dichotomy of melodic and heavy.Martin tells us, “The song ‘Ascension Day’ is a note to myself. A note to remember not to allow myself to live in the darkest parts of my brain 24/7. To remember that, while there will always be dark and malignant areas of the human experience, I still have plenty of tools to rely on in my own mind and in my heart to build a bridge across the river of shit.”The album was produced by James Brown (Foo Fighters, Ghost, Nine Inch Nails), and mastered by Ted Jenson (Alice in Chains, Guns N’ Roses, Mastodon). Pre-orders for Subtle are available here.Along with the new album, Lo-Pan will be embarking on a summer tour supporting Corrosion of Conformity.

"Jamila Woods is back with a new single called “Baldwin”. It’s her fourth preview track off LEGACY! LEGACY!, the follow-up to her 2106 breakthrough album HEAVN, which drops May 10th via Jagjaguwar.“Baldwin” sees Woods croon lightly through a mellow, upbeat R&B groove. Cushioning the chorus are waves of trumpet, courtesy of Nico Segal of The Social Experiment and the newly launched Intellexual. Whereas earlier singles “Giovanni”, “Zora”, and “Eartha” have rhythm-heavy goalposts, “Baldwin” burns a bit slower, taking its time to place the emphasis on Woods’ vocals.(Listen: Jamila Woods on Finding Live Music Through the Church)According to a press release, “Baldwin” takes inspiration from the renowned novelist, playwright, and activist James Baldwin, particularly the “Letter to My Nephew” in his book The Fire Next Time. “He had an incredible ability to speak about whiteness in a way that was hard-hitting and nuanced,” Woods explained in a statment. “[He] delivered some of the most elegant reads to white America, providing me a lens to think about how I see whiteness at work in my world today.”Check out the song and its lyric video below.Woods recently announced an extensive tour in support of LEGACY!

"Sinkane has a new album, Dépaysé, on the way later this month. Already we’ve heard a pair of previews in the title track and jubilant “Everybody”, and now a third song has been revealed.Titled “Ya Sudan”, the afro-funk tune sees band leader Ahmed Gallab exploring his cultural roots and identity as the child of Sudanese parents. He explained further in a statement:“I am so inspired by how the recent uprising in Sudan has unified Sudanese people all over the world. I feel like we are truly understanding our identity. It feels inclusive and welcoming. Sudan is one of the most diverse places on Earth. From the Nuba Mountains to Port Sudan. Dongola to Darfur. Kassala to Khartoum. We are people made up of different languages, cultures, and religions. Our differences create our beautiful and rich identity. As for me, growing up outside of Sudan has given depth to my identity. This is the message of ‘Ya Sudan’.”Stream it below via a video featuring Sinkane’s childhood family photos.Dépaysé officially hits shelves May 31st through City Slang. To coincide with today’s track release, Sinkane has expanded his live schedule to include a fall US tour that kicks off in September.

"Michael Stipe played two short surprise sets last week at the newly renovated Webster Hall in New York. And they each boasted completely new material.Opening for headliner Patti Smith on May 1st and May 2nd, the R.E.M. frontman packed three new songs into his abridged 15-minute sets. Assisted by past collaborator and musician/producer Andy LeMaster (Bright Eyes), Stipe performed tracks titled “Your Capricious Soul” and “Drive to the Ocean”. He also did an as-yet-untitled number which featured the line “showed up to a party box in my hand.”(Read: Ranking: Every R.E.M. Album from Worst to Best)These three songs were actually debuted at a benefit show last month at NYC’s American Museum of Natural History, but the Webster Hall gigs mark the first time they’ve been captured on video.Check out fan-caught footage below.Stipe previously teamed up with Rain Phoenix for a double A-side single featuring unreleased River Phoenix songs.

"Bristol punks IDLES stormed across the pond last year with their politically powered sophomore album, Joy as an Act of Resistance. As they gear up for a largely sold-out US tour behind the effort, the band has today unleashed a new single called “Mercedes Marxist”.Taken from the Resistance sessions, the track bristles with an unseated anger. Joe Talbot growls almost melodically over antsy guitars, singing, “They gambled all our pride/ They want money instead/ They gone and speared my side/ I think they want me dead.” Take a listen below.IDLES’ upcoming tour, which kicks off tomorrow night in Albany, New York, includes festival appearances at Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, Glastonbury, and Lowlands in The Netherlands.

"Phantom Planet have returned for good.Earlier this year, the California rockers reunited in Los Angeles for a secret show. They then followed that secret show by announcing that they would appear at Hanson’s forthcoming Hop Jam in Tulsa, Oklahoma this month. Now, they’ve confirmed they’re officially reunited 25 years after first forming, and are once again working with producer Tony Berg to record their follow-up to 2008’s Raise the Dead.“Tony has always been a big proponent of my song-writing and he’s probably one of the only people whose opinion I trust,” said singer-songwriter Alex Greenwald, adding: “Every Phantom Planet record has been an experiment. I’m sure this one will be no different.” You can find out now as the band’s already unloaded a new single in “Balisong”, which you can stream below.Of the song, which Greenwald told Billboard deals with his obsession with a butterfly knife, he added: “It’s something that is really easily concealed but with the right know-how can be easily pulled out and is sharp as hell. I just went down the rabbit hole with that and the band loved the song and it was one of the first ones we did.”In addition to all of these big announcements, they’ve also secured a handful of new tour dates — beginning tonight! Yes, the band will take the stage at San Diego’s The Casbah this evening, where they’ll test and debut all sorts of new material. They’ll following that up in the days ahead with similar intimate shows in local haunts ahead of their Hop Jam appearance.Phantom Planet 2019 Tour Dates:

"Remember those Got Milk ads from the ’90s?Mac DeMarco probably does, at least if we’re to judge the twisted music video for his new single, “On the Square”. The latest track off his forthcoming fourth studio album, Here Comes the Cowboy, gets downright weird, and in the best way possible.“This video has been my most intimate experience with milk yet,” says co-director William Sipos of the dairy chaos. “At one point I had Mac in a latex mask, shivering in a kiddie pool filled with cold milk. I did not feel like a nice person.” No kidding.Watch below.Here Comes the Cowboy hits stores on May 10th via Mac’s Record Label. “On the Square” follows past singles “All Of Our Yesterdays” and “Nobody”. In related news, DeMarco recently addressed the Mitski conundrum and also covered Feist.",articles40,"['Got Milk', 'DeMarco']"
"This week marks the arrival of Here Comes the Cowboy, the new album from Mac DeMarco. To support the LP, Canada’s self-described jizz jazzer performed one of its singles, “All of Our Yesterdays”, on The Tonight Show last week. It turns out DeMarco also filmed a cover song session backstage the same evening.Footage has now be released and sees DeMarco putting a very passionate spin on “One Evening”, a jazzy cut off the 2004 Feist record, Let It Die. DeMarco also took the time to describe Feist as Canadian royalty. (Yeah, today’s not just about the #RoyalBaby.)(Read: Where Have All the Indie Rock Bands Gone?)“This is a song by the queen of Canada,” he said prior to his cover performance. “Most of you Americans probably don’t realize that we have a queen, but we do. Her name is Leslie Feist. We love you, Les.”Watch it below.Here Comes the Cowboy arrives this Friday, May 10th. DeMarco recently commented on the controversy surrounding his new album and its similarity in title to Mitski’s own Be the Cowboy. “It’s ridiculous,” he told Huck magazine, playing down the backlash. “It’s just music.”Later this week, DeMarco will hit the road for on an extensive tour that runs until November.

"FINNEAS may not be as big of a household named as his younger sister, Billie Eilish, but he’s no less talented. In fact, the singer left his fingerprints all over Eilish’s debut LP, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, helping write and produce the record with the global pop star. Now, FINNEAS is demonstrating his own chops with a newly released solo number “I Lost a Friend”.The 21-year-old Los Angeles native has crafted a thoughtful, heartfelt song about the loss of friendship. With FINNEAS’ soulful vocals at the center of the track, “I Lost a Friend” sports a generally minimalist approach to instrumentation, though eventually adds rich layered harmonies and an aggressive beat in the latter half. As the vocalist explained in a statement,(Read: 20 Essential Acts to Catch on Tour This Spring and Summer)“This song was born out of a falling out I had with my childhood best friend. I’ve made a lot of music covering romantic relationships and a lot covering family but I’d never been able to articulate what it feels like to lose a friend until now. Hope this song gives you some comfort if you’ve ever felt the same way.”Stream FINNEAS’ “I Lost a Friend” below.FINNEAS recently made back-to-back appearances at Coachella, guesting during Eilish’s high-profile debut.

"The members of Savages have been off finding other creative outlets in the downtime since the English post-punk outfit’s last record. Following 2016’s impactful Adore Life, Fay Wilton and Ayse Hassan launched 180dB, while band leader Jehnny Beth has collaborated with the likes of Gorillaz and Trentemøller. Now, the frontwoman is trying her hand at a new endeavor: film scoring.Beth has teamed with Savages producer (and her partner) Johnny Hostile to provide the soundtrack to XY Chelsea, a new documentary about Chelsea Manning. With the record coming out June 7th via Pop Noire, they’ve shared the lead single and closing credits track “Let It Out”. The track is perhaps a more grooving, synth-ier sound than Beth’s fans may be used to, but it still maintains some of her more gothic atmospheric tendencies.In a statement about the song, Beth and Hostile said,“It is about being inside Chelsea’s head at the moment she decides she won’t be hiding anymore. It’s a great moment of human bravery that can inspire anyone in this world to go beyond their own fear and accept who they are no matter the consequences.”Take a listen below.Pre-orders for the XY Chelsea soundtrack are now live. The film itself premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival after filmmakers were forced to make a last minute edit to reflect Manning’s recent situation. Manning was famously sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking information about the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, a sentence she began in 2010. While incarcerated, she came out as transgender and began both her advocacy and her transition while in jail. President Obama commuted her sentence in 2017 near the end of his presidency; however, Manning was placed back behind bars in March when she refused to testify before a grande jury in the case against Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.Showtime will debut the documentary on June 7th.

"In just a few weeks, Operators will return with their sophomore album, Radiant Dawn. The trio of Dan Boeckner (Wolf Parade, Handsome Furs), Sam Brown (Divine Fits, New Bomb Turks), and Devojka wrote and recorded the LP throughout 2018 and early 2019 in both Montreal and Vancouver Island.The follow-up to 2016’s Blue Wave was previewed early with last month’s “Faithless”, which we described as “a darkly coruscating electropop cut”. A second offering has been unboxed today in “I Feel Emotion”.Although the track is upbeat in tone and colored with tingling synths, Boeckner’s voice carries a kind of ache, as though there’s a palpable void in his life. Its corresponding music video, helmed by Caleb Bardgett and Johnny Dunn, also conveys the idea of longing — specifically for days and memories past — using old television screens and video footage.In a statement, keyboardist Devojka explained the connection between the track and visual:“‘I Feel Emotion’ is a song for anyone who feels like they don’t know how to be alive in the world today. The video we made for ‘I Feel Emotion’ is compound nostalgia. It was inspired by a video installation I saw at an exhibition at MOMA called ‘Toward A Concrete Utopia, Architecture in Yugoslavia 1948-1980’. The installation was a stack of tv screens playing short loops taken from what looked to be old commercials and footage of people in various states of everydayness. As a first generation ex-Yugoslavian, I was surprised to find myself fascinated and moved; the intimacy of a woman ecstatically twirling with her purse flung on her shoulder in her smart and modern skirt completely arrested me. I come from a long line of pain, and I’ve been estranged from my family for some years now. Making the video was a way to connect to this heritage; something equally familiar and foreign to me. I combed through hours of footage from old Yugoslavian films looking for those intimate moments – the moments that happen between the BIG EVENTS in our lives.”Check out “I Feel Emotion” below.Radiant Dawn officially arrives May 17th through Last Gang Records. The album was co-produced by Operators alongside Wolf Parade’s Arlen Thompson and Napster Vertigo. Tim Kingsbury of Arcade Fire contributed bass on the record’s closing track, “Low Life”.To support the LP, Operators will launch a North American tour at the end of the month.

"TOMORROW X TOGETHER are the latest K-pop stars to come out of the Big Hit Entertainment management house (the same company that brought us BTS). When they dropped The Dream Chapter: STAR back in March, it landed at No. 140 on the Billboard charts, the highest-charting debut effort from a freshman act in the exploding genre. Now, just a week out from their forthcoming US tour, they’ve shared an English version of the EP’s new single “Cat & Dog”.Translating lyrics is rarely a precise or pretty undertaking, as syllables and meanings change drastically between languages. For example, how’s this for a hook?: “I don’t wanna be just friends/ It’s no coincidence/ It’s a kitty-incidence.” That ridiculous portmanteau doesn’t seem to exist in the original version, where “It’s a kitty-incidence” is actually a different English line, “Can I be your pet?” Seems it’s easy to interpolate English into Korean lyrics then it is to straight translate the latter into the former.(Read: 10 K-pop Idol Groups That Will Make You Swoon)But at least English-speaking fans can now have a generally better understanding of the lyrics. The new version comes with an accompanying video that’s largely the same as the previously revealed Korean video for “Cat & Dog”.

"Origins is a recurring feature that seeks to let an artist dig into the various inspirations behind their latest music.Rhye has announced his latest project, the eight-track Spirit. Due out May 10th (June 28th on vinyl), the follow-up to last year’s Blood finds alternative R&B artist Mike Milosh playing music like he’s never recorded before.The impetus of Spirit came when Milosh’s girlfriend came into possession of a slightly beaten up baby grand piano. Milosh found himself spending every morning sitting at the instrument, reconnecting with his classical routes as he sketched out the beginnings of new music. Eventually, he entered the studio with former Semisonic member turned hit songwriter Dan Wilson (Adele, Josh Groban, Phantogram) to flesh out the tunes. Thomas “Doveman” Bartlett also appears on the album, as does Icelandic musician Ólafur Arnalds, who is featured on “Patience”.As a first listen to the soulful piano music of Rhye’s Spirit, he’s shared the lead single “Needed”. The longing is tangible from the first, echoing notes, transmuting aching desire sonics before a word is even uttered. Strings, synths, and hand claps come in to add texture, but it’s those yearning keys and Milosh’s hushed, breathy vocals that will leave you mesmerized.Take a listen below.Pre-orders for the vinyl version Spirit are now live. The tracklist and Rhye’s upcoming tour dates are ahead, but before getting to that, read on as Milosh takes us deeper into the Origins of “Needed”.Falling Back in Love with the Piano:My girlfriend was gifted a baby grand piano by a friend who was looking for a place to store it. We put it in the living room. It arrived at our house, and I started to play every morning before breakfast. It became a ritual, a great way to wake up and start my day. I fell in love with playing the piano again and finding that joy became a welcome meditation.My Relationship with Classical Music:My dad was a classical violinist, and I played cello forever as a child. I grew up listening to classical music. It’s been really fascinating to follow this new wave of classical musicians that are doing this mellow, sentimental and emotional music that’s not overly technical, even though their technique is very unique. I really connect with it. Ólafur Arnalds is one of these musicians. Nils Frahm is too.Secular Sabbath:My girlfriend and I throw events called Secular Sabbath which create sacred spaces to explore creativity and make music that comes from impromptu, real moments in special environments around the world. I really fell in love with this gentle, ambient music and the process of making it. Secular Sabbath has allowed me the opportunity to work with certain musicians for the first time. I originally met Ólafur Arnalds when we invited him to our Secular Sabbath in Iceland.Dan Wilson:I met Dan Wilson and we quickly connected over the sound of his piano. We didn’t have a preconceived notion of what we were going to work on together, but we developed a song quite quickly. Working with different producers you get to discover different parts of you by experiencing their process. In my mind, Dan produces from a spiritual and emotional place. You haven’t satisfied him until you can make the hair on his arm stand up. He pushes you to get the emotion inside of you to come out. It’s nice working with people who are emotive and not purely technical.Spirit:Like everything I ever do, Spirit is reflective of where I am now. I’ve just finished a long year of touring the Blood album, and exploring mellow music makes me calm and allows me to be introspective after such a hectic year. Connecting back to my daily rituals, and spending time in the studio without an agenda has helped me find balance.Spirit Tracklist:

"On the heels of her show-stopping, $5 million dollar performance at the Billboard Music Awards, Madonna has released a new song. “I Rise” serves as closing track to her upcoming album, Madame X. The politically charged anthem begins with a sample of Emma Gonzalez’s speech calling for stricter gun control in the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in February 2018. Take a listen below.In a statement, Madonna says she wrote “I Rise” “as a way of giving a voice to all marginalized people who feel they don’t have the opportunity to speak their mind. This year is the 50th anniversary of Pride and I hope this song encourages all individuals to be who they are, to speak their minds and to love themselves.”(Read: 10 Pop Albums for People Who Hate Pop)The release of “I Rise” comes one day ahead of the 30th annual GLAAD Media Awards in New York City, where Madonna will be honored with the Advocate for Change Award.Madame X arrives June 14th via Interscope Records.

In addition to his production work, Lacy appears on the previously revealed “Sunflower” as well as “Flower Moon”. A number of other songs were previewed ahead of the release, including “Unbearably White”, “Harmony Hall”, “2021”, and “Big Blue”.Speaking of the downtime between albums to GQ, Koening said,“On the last record, I had this slight feeling that we got a little bit too big… [Now] sometimes people ask me, ‘Are you nervous that you’ve been gone so long?’ And I might have been nervous three years ago, like, ‘Am I gonna get all this shit together?’ Now I’m at this place where I’m kinda like, if the record wasn’t done and I wasn’t excited to go on tour, I might even wait longer. Not only did I stop stressing about the fact that it had taken so long, I started to be like, ;This makes sense’. Why do people release music more than every five years?”Take a listen below.

"Eminem has teamed up with Logic for a new track. Titled “Homicide”, it’s available to stream below.Logic is reportedly releasing a new album dubbed Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in the near future. “Homicide” is believed to be the album’s first single. Update: Logic’s new album is due out Friday, May 10th, and features the artwork below.In March, he dropped the best-selling book Supermarket, as well as a companion soundtrack album. Late last year, it was announced that Logic would be starring in his first feature film, a J.J. Abrams-produced title called Everything Must Go.(Read: The 25 Greatest Hip-Hop Debut Albums)As for Eminem, his last full-length, Kamikaze, came out in December, which he followed with the 11-minute “Kick Off” freestyle.

"Rapper Open Mike Eagle and comedian Baron Vaughn recently launched their new Comedy Central variety show The New Negroes. Each episode features multiple stand-up sets as well as a new original song and music video from OME and a special music guest. This week, the rapper has teamed with Phonte on a new single “Woke as Me”.Following up prior show collaborations with Danny Brown and MF Doom, “Woke as Me” finds OME and Phonte competing to be the most “woke.” The video opens with a brief skit about Beyoncé conspiracy theories, with Phonte advocating that the Lemonade singer is actually a shape-shifter. Stationed in a barbershop getting hair cuts, the two hip-hop artists then launch into their collaboration, which finds them expertly riffing on political correctness and cancel culture.Throughout the video, comedian duo The Lucas Brothers play a Mortal Kombat-esque arcade game. Hilariously, the two comics choose between various “woke” characters — such as campus crusaders, yoga moms, and junior professors– to battle. Watch the satirical clip below.

"Origins is a recurring feature that requests musicians dig into the various inspirations behind their newest music.Des Rocs is on a mission to bring old-school rock ‘n’ roll back to the mainstream. Musically, the New York City native has found his niche, drawing on classic rock and updating it with a modern edge. Gritty and loud, Des’ impressive sound is matched by his in-your-face stage presence that recalls the brooding charisma (and leather jackets) of 1950s greasers.The rocker is currently on the rise and has been enjoying performing at sold-out venues across the country. Following his recent six-week tour with Grandson, Des is currently prepping for a tour with The Struts later this month and an appearance at Lollapalooza in August. Ahead of the anticipated summer outings, the rock revivalist has released a new single, “SLO”.The track highlights what Des Rocs does best by capturing his unapologetic bravado from a bygone era. The explosive guitar riffs and an aggressive rhythm section serve as the perfect companion to his energetic vocals. However, the song remains fresh through its use of soulful background singers and the light-handed electronic effects that lace the piece. Listen for yourself below.The rocker has taken the time to speak to the Origins of “SLO”. Hear what Rocs has to say about modern pop music, Elvis, New York City, and more below.Jimi Hendrix — “Mannish Boy” (Muddy Waters cover):I’d had this one on repeat for a long time. I’m obsessed with this drawn out intro that leads your ear in one direction before spinning around and taking off with this a relentless forward drive. There’s also a certain raw element to the performance that feels like the band rehearsed the idea a few times, tracked it and whatever the recording was is what it was. I love the idea of records just being what they are. Some times I’ll slave over a single production for months, but other times it’s freeing to be a bit more fatalistic and say “that first take of drums and guitar is what the record is and that’s it, I don’t like anything after take one.”Modern pop music:“SLO” is the antithesis of all modern pop music and everything on the radio. This record gives no fucks in how raw it gets and flagrantly embracing blues progressions and big muffs. You don’t hear a guitar through a big muff on the radio today. Those tones are like being punched with a massive fist made out of a beehive. I want to provide a clear alternative to alt radio and pop and let you know that this is who I am and this is what I stand for.New York City:New York City is a part of every single record I make and song I write. It’s frenzied, chaotic and uncertain. More than anything else, New York is founded on the idea of dreaming big. With SLO I wanted to invite the listener into a massive, dark and frenzied world that channels the way I’ve felt on some of my stranger nights living and growing up in this city.Elvis:Elvis is a towering figure in my life, as a performer and a singer. His live movements lived in a certain place in his body that was instilled in my DNA at a very young age. There’s a certain movement to SLO that’s born of those classic motions.“SLO” Artwork:",articles40,"['Des Rocs', 'The Struts', 'Rocs', 'Jimi Hendrix', 'Muddy Waters', 'Those', 'Elvis']"
"At last, the Bill Callahan drought has ended. The beloved folk troubadour has announced his return, and fans will only have to wait a month to hear what he’s been working on.Callahan has just announced a brand new album titled Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, his first in nearly six years. The album follows up 2013’s beautiful Dream River. It’s set to be released on June 14th via Drag City Records, his longtime label home.According to a press release, Callahan went through big life changes after releasing Dream River, the biggest of which was getting married and having a kid. “But afterwards, it was suddenly harder for him to find the place where the songs came, to make him and these new experiences over again into something to sing,” the press release explains. “His songs have always been elusive, landing lightly between character study and autobiography, as the singer-songwriter often does. This felt different, though. After 20 years of putting music first, he wasn’t prepared to go away from it completely. Or perhaps, after all the time, the obvious needs to be made just a little more explicit?”(Read: Bill Callahan: Caught in the Reeds with America’s Post-Modern Patriot)The press release goes on to describe the 20-track album as having “shorter” songs than usual, a tradeoff for the sheer number of songs themselves. It also says Callahan wrote them “from somewhere beyond his Eagle-Apocalypse-River headspace” and, as a result, the record is “very much its own beast.”That description fits with the album artwork seen in a teaser video Drag City released. Check out that clip below.This news arrives just weeks after Drag City announced that most of their catalog is finally available on streaming services. Most Callahan fans probably already bought his records, as that used to be the only way you could listen to him (imagine that!). If you want to keep your collection going, the good news is that Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest is available to pre-order now.After the album drops, Callahan will be hitting the road this summer and fall for a proper tour through the US and Europe.

"With new album Atlanta Millionaires Club, indie songwriter Faye Webster has been highlighting more than just her intimate songwriting. She’s also been flexing her dexterity in musical textures.Last month’s “Flowers” single saw her playing around with softly pulsing R&B. As for today’s offering, “Right Side of My Neck”, Webster drapes herself in arrangements built with plush brass and strings. The track’s richness in sound directly mirrors the actual moment that inspired the song itself, an instance which saw Webster intoxicated by a new yet uncertain love.“This song I didn’t think about writing or what I was doing, I was fresh from a feeling and that’s when I get some of my most honest and relatable songs,” she explained in a statement.Take a listen below.Atlanta Millionares Club hits shelves May 24th through Secretly Canadian.

"Indie Americana outfits Calexico and Iron & Wine have joined forces for a new collaborative album, Years to Burn. Out July 14th via Sub Pop (City Slang in the UK/EU), the 8-track LP was previously previewed with the lead single, “Father Mountain”. Today we’ve been gifted another sample of the effort, “Midnight Sun”.The track sees Calexico’s Joey Burns and Iron & Wine’s Sam Beam trading hushed and haunted verses, their voices building on each other like a dark warmth cresting over the horizon. Lap-steel yawns underneath, holding back Burns’ electric guitar as long as it can until it breaks through on the bridge.“Midnight Sun” comes to us via a lyric video from animator Jonny Sanders, who brought motion to the more than 100 paintings Beam made for the album’s cover art.

"Track by Track is a recurring new music feature in which we ask an artist to give in depth insight into their latest album one track at a time.Pile are set to return with their new album, Green and Gray, later this week. Ahead of the official May 3rd release, the Boston post-punk outfit is sharing an early stream of the entire LP, along with a track by track breakdown.Marking the band’s seventh record overall, Green and Gray follows 2017’s A Hairshirt of Purpose. Created alongside veteran producer Kevin S McMahon (Titus Andronicus, The Walkmen), the effort is also Pile’s first since amicably parting ways with guitarist Matt Beker and bassist Matt Connery. Touring guitarist Chappy Hull took over full-time for Becker, while Stove’s Alex Molini entered in place of Connery.Explaining to Noisey what it was like working on new music while incorporating new band members, frontman Rick Maguire said,“With writing things, I definitely wanted to expand and do new things, but I didn’t want it to seem drastically different. I didn’t want people to say, ‘Oh, this is a completely different band now.’ But now that we’ve done this record I feel like we have more room to get weirder in whatever way that means, just whatever is outside what is the norm for us.”Stream the whole thing below, followed by Maguire’s Track by Track breakdown. Pile will tour behind Green and Gray this summer, and you can get tickets here and check the secondary market here.“Firewood”:
This song is about how I relate to working, to people around me and to where I am between the beginning and end of my life. I understand that’s really broad but that was the energy I put into it and I understand that whether or not that comes across is another thing altogether. It took a long time to write this song, I started it about two years ago when I was writing stuff for A Hairshirt of Purpose. The band exhibited serious patience in dealing with how many times I changed this song.“Your Performance”:
More or less trying to understand my compulsion to be on a stage and my desire for a bunch of strangers’ attention, not only that but then trying to turn that attention into my livelihood. Furthermore, to try to figure out what defect would cause anyone to need that much attention and validation. Also, if I get to be my own boss I thought I should give myself an evaluation as well as an explanation. There are political undertones to this one, mostly coming from the thought that if narcissism goes unchecked or unchallenged there’s potential you might end up like that guy.“On a Bigger Screen”:
The paranoia and anxiety and general grossness that I experience volunteering otherwise private information to be broadcasted all of the time in exchange for recognition and promotion. There’s some complicated and maybe convoluted friction between this one and “Your Performance”.“Other Moons”:
An analytical look at loneliness. A consideration that maybe that companionship isn’t for everyone and aloofness towards pairing up is a personality trait. But that consideration might just be a poor excuse for escapism. I wrote this song pretty quickly and near the completion of writing of the album as a whole, I just thought it helped to round the whole thing out.“Hair”:
I wrote the song quickly which doesn’t happen all that often. I went over to my aunt’s house to do some yard work while she was away, I took a break I started playing on the piano and I wrote the song. Ordinarily, I edit and rework songs until they’re unrecognizable from how they started, but I just left this one alone. Lyrically, I must’ve been feeling crowded or smothered in some way because that’s what came out.“A Labyrinth with No Center”:
Navigating existence in the wake of the choices I’ve made, vacillating between tenacious and deflated about the future. This song also took a really long time to write, involving many high highs and low lows, floating anywhere from “this is the best thing you’ve ever done” to “you should scrap all of this.” I’ve lived with it too long now to have anything close to an objective opinion regarding where it landed.“The Soft Hands of Stephen Miller”:
About the advisor to the president. Usually, it’s difficult for me to concentrate much vitriol on one guy, especially one I don’t know personally, but he’s the exception. I’ve had similar sentiments regarding our president but I can relate to him less (Stephen Miller is my age). On my better days, the idea of him (the president) just saddens me because I know he’s profoundly confused and damaged beyond repair, but Stephen Miller is a different brand of smug racist because I could imagine him being on my bus in high school, and that, I think, brings to light a different but related set of complicated emotions.“Lord of Calendars”:
A colorful expression of how I feel about taking ownership of my time and also how I manage my personal resources. I guess it’s more or less a celebration of autonomy that’s a little rough around the edges.“Bruxist Grin”:
This is about a panic attack I had when I went to bed. I was about to move out of the city I’d lived in for over a decade and everything felt foreign and strange and weirdly psychedelic and my heart was racing but I couldn’t move. Musically, I didn’t put too much pressure on writing the song and it ended up coming about pretty easily.“A Bug on Its Back”:
It seems that empathy is in short supply and it felt like a thing worth talking about. I also was listening to a lot of Horse Lords and Can when I was working on this song.“My Employer”:
I could say for this what I said about Firewood except in this one almost all of the lyrics could be read with a shrug. It’s a half sarcastic love song dedicated to working and a half-hearted apology to those who have suffered my obsession with it (working). The music for the one came about pretty quickly. Prior to this and “Other Moons” I thought the record was going to be mostly heavy, loud or aggressive songs, but I’m glad there was room for some of the more soft and moody stuff.“Hiding Places”:
The fear of being exposed sometimes causes the unflattering truths to be obfuscated and then ignored, leaving the door open to benefit from the fact that the truth has been rendered irrelevant. In other words, sometimes it feels like putting your best foot forward is a trick and a lie. More specifically, trying to make art with the intention that it be purchased and consumed means you’re framing it in that way, leaving out some of the unflattering details. In the studio, we tried to challenge ourselves by playing the guitar solo part as slow as possible. I think we all still feel we could have played it slower but at this point, we’ll just have to do that at shows.“No Hands”:
The end of a relationship that lasted longer than it should have and feeling like a fool for being that last person keeping it on life support.",articles40,"['Track', 'Titus Andronicus', 'The Walkmen', 'Pile’s', 'Matt Beker', 'Rick Maguire', '“The Soft Hands', 'Horse Lords', 'Firewood']"
"Noel Gallagher and his High Flying Birds have announced a new EP called Black Star Dancing. Due out June 14th digitally and on 12-inch vinyl, the follow-up to 2017’s Who Built the Moon? is being previewed today with the title track.The song lives up to its name with its dark disco rhythm and restrained shimmying. If Franz Ferdinand were trapped by a physical wall of bass, it might well sound something like “Black Star Dancing”. Or, if you were to ask Gallagher himself, it sounds more like every great rock band from the ’80s:“It manages to combine the influences of David Bowie, INXS, U2, Queen, Indeep AND ZZ Top FFS!… I might have been watching too much Top Of The Pops recently… anyway, it’s ‘dope’… not my words, but the words of Nile Rodgers who literally danced in the studio when he heard it!”Take a listen below.Black Star Dancing features two other tracks — “Rattling Rose” and “Sail On” — alongside alternate versions of “Black Star Dancing”.

"Post-hardcore veterans Hot Water Music will release a new EP titled Shake Up the Shadows via Epitaph Records on May 24th, and they’ve unveiled the single “Rebellion Story” (listen below).For the new EP, singer-guitarist Chuck Ragan brought some of the vibe of his more folk-leaning solo career, stating, “I’ve never stopped singing or performing and along with that comes learning just how far I can push things.”As far as the lyrical themes, Ragan added, “I think we’re living in a really volatile and terrifying time where people are turning a blind eye to the hatred that’s happening in this world and thinking of themselves rather than the big picture. I think that sentiment is present in these new songs the way it has always kind of been there in our music.”The Gainesville, Florida, band — rounded out by singer-guitarist Chris Wollard, bassist Jason Black, and drummer George Rebelo — formed roughly 25 years ago, having released eight full-length albums along the way.

Ahead of the release of the forthcoming biopic Rocketman, Paramount and Interscope have shared the music video for Egerton’s rendition of the classic title track, “Rocket Man”.The clip focuses on Egerton singing in a studio while interpolating scenes from the movie. It wraps with a look at John’s iconic Dodgers Stadium performance from 1975, which looks to have either been reshot or digitally manipulated to make it appear as if Egerton is belting the track as he makes his entrance.

"Sigur Rós frontman Jónsi has formed a new group with Swedish composer and visual artist Carl Michael von Hausswolff. Together known as Dark Morph, they’re prepping to release their self-titled debut album on May 10th through Krunk/The Vinyl Factory.The eight-track LP was developed as part of a fellowship and residency program at TBA21-Academy, an organization “dedicated to fostering a deeper understanding of the ocean through the lens of art and to engendering creative solutions to its most pressing issues.” The album incorporates field recordings of creatures like humpback whales, bats, dark morph herons, and more collected at the Vanua Vatu Reef in Fiji. It was later mixed at the Gee Jam Studios in Jamaica.In a statement, von Hausswolff spoke at length about the process of obtaining all of the album’s unique sounds:“While we were on the boat I started to take the recordings, manipulate them and mutate them into drones or other types of musical functions — so we could use the sounds as instruments for building compositions. We decided, “Let’s try not to have them sounding too much like real sounds, let’s turn them into something else.” When I had done some drones, some long tones out of a bird or something, I gave it to Jónsi and he started to peel off certain types of melodious things, and then play it to me. And then we started to just throw the ball back and forth.”For an early look at the Dark Morph album, Jónsi and von Hausswolff have shared a track dubbed “BEKA YALO”.

A third offering in “Hairpin Turns” has been unboxed today.The new song is accompanied by a music video helmed by Mike Mills, the director of The National’s corresponding I Am Easy to Find film. Set against a stark white backdrop, the minimalist clip sees the indie rockers play their instruments as dancers perform around them.In a statement, Mills explained his vision for the video:“The video is a very simple portrait of the band (and the friends who helped make the song) and the song itself: You see all the instruments that make up the song in isolation, even hear them recorded live on set over the album version, kind of like showing you the tracks that make up the song. And you see everyone who contributed alone, including Gail Ann Dorsey, Pauline Delasser (a.k.a.

"Titus Andronicus are due to return with their latest album, An Obelisk, later this summer. Produced by the great Bob Mould, the June 21st release follows a narrative journey of self-discovery and identity reconciliation. At the end of the modern spirit quest, the narrator declares, “I’m going to try and be a kinder person,” explained frontman Patrick Stickles. Now, he and the band have revealed the LP’s denouement with the closing track “Tumult Around the World”.Where previous single “(I Blame) Society” angrily derided the ills of the world, “Tumult” finds acceptance in the fact that people everywhere face the same turmoil. “Everywhere there’s someone dying/ There’s a woman giving birth,” Stickles bellows in his trademark scratch, only to remind the listener, “But everywhere there’s people dreaming/ And people holding onto hope.” There are some beach-y “ooh-ah oohs” behind him and a celebratory march of drums, elevating the narrator’s assertion that at least we’re all getting through this chaos together.(Read: 10 Most Anticipated Legacy Rock Albums of 2019)Take a listen via the video below, which finds Stickles enjoy a cup of tea while reading the essay collection Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism and Carl Jung’s Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious.Speaking further of the track in a statement, Stickles said,“It’s so hard to stop the stream of spoilers these days. It should not be terribly surprising to anyone that we must each strive to shatter the illusion of individuation so that we might offer greater empathy and understanding to our whole human family, united as we are in our common struggle, and even if it is, well, I don’t want to wait til the record comes out to tell everybody.”Pre-orders for An Obelisk, the follow-up to 2018’s A Productive Cough, are now live.

"Scuzzy Los Angeles rockers Goon have announced their debut album, Heaven Is Humming. Due out July 19th via Partisan Records, the full-length follows a pair of well-received EPs, 2016’s Dusk of Punk and 2017’s Happy Omen.The 11 tracks on the record were written while the band’s primary force, singer/songwriter/guitarist Kenny Becker, was dealing with a chronic sinus condition that was so serious it would often debilitate his hearing. During his periods of good health and while recovering from surgery, he found solace in his music. As he explained in a press release,“I find encouragement in the fact that I’m able to be productive in the times that I’m not sick. People like to romanticize the periods in which, for example, someone like Van Gogh was suffering, but it was actually because he was sick that he would go outside and see a cherry-blossom tree and be struck by its beauty. It would make him realize, ‘This might be the last time I see this, I don’t know when I’ll have this snatched away from me again.’”Dropping back in March, lead single “Datura” showed off a grungy, psychedelia side of Goon, but Heaven Is Humming is a record of range. To demonstrate that, the band has shared a pair of new tracks, “Northern Saturn” and “Snoqualmie”. The former sticks closer to the earlier track, a dark and lo-fi slogger that spirals out into the abyss of space. The latter, on the other hand, is a contemplative desert trip, complete with meandering acoustics and the deep breaths of strings.Take a listen to both below, with “Snoqualmie” coming via an impressionist video helmed by Becker himself.

"Ezra Furman has announced a new album, Twelve Nudes. Serving as the follow-up to last year’s Transangelic Exodus, the 11-track effort is due out August 30th Via Bella Union.Described in a press release as Furman’s “‘spiritually queer’ punk record,” Twelve Nudes was recorded in Oakland during the fall of 2018. With Jay Reatard and philosopher Anne Carson as his spiritual guides, Furman sought to confront his pent-up rage at the misbalanced state of culture and politics.To that end, he’s offered “Calm Down” (aka “I Should Not Be Alone”) as the lead single. Accompanied by a vibrant, frantic animated video directed by Beth Jeans Houghton, the track is a furious plea for internal mollification in the face of external madness. Said Furman of the song in a press release,“Desperate times make for desperate songs. I wrote this in the summer of 2018, a terrible time. It’s the sound of me struggling to admit that I’m not okay with the current state of human civilization, in which bad men crush us into submission. Once you admit how bad it feels to live in a broken society, you can start to resist it, and imagine a better one.”Take a listen via the clip below.Pre-orders for Twelve Nudes are now live.

"Origins, a recurring feature, encourages artists to analyze the various inspirations behind their latest release.Chicago indie outfit Scotland Yard Gospel Choir called it quits in the late aughts shortly after a major tour van accident left band members with multiple serious injuries. But the demise of SYGC eventually led to the birth of Fashion Brigade, a new project from band member Elia Einhorn.Einhorn is prepping to soon release a debut album titled Fvck the Heartache. The songs on the effort date back to 2009, when he was still fresh out of the hospital after being treated for a broken neck and back. Recording took place in Olympia at K Records’ Dub Narcotic studio, Chicago’s IV Labs, and Brooklyn’s Silent Barn, as well as various bedrooms and a converted railway station in Wales.“When SYGC called it quits, I felt terribly unmoored, and working on these songs helped get me through,” Einhorn said in a statement to Consequence of Sound. “This album’s been a long time in the making, and I’m so psyched to finally push it out of the nest!”(Read: The 10 Most Anticipated Indie Rock Albums of 2019)Although Fashion Brigade is Einhorn’s solo venture, he is hardly alone on his forthcoming Fashion Brigade album. Fvck the Heartache is filled to the brim with guest contributors, including LCD Soundsystem members, Frankie Cosmos, Dirty Projectors, Thor Harris of Swans, and Phosphorescent.CoS is premiering two of these collaborations today. The first is a warm and saccharine lo-fi pop cut titled “First Sunny Day of the Year”, which features Jo Schornikow, Phosphorescent keyboardist and partner of band leader Matthew Houck. “The chill’s gone from the air and hints of spring appear,” the song’s opening verse leads with shining optimism. “It’s the first sunny day of the year.”The second, meanwhile, is a 30-second offering dubbed “Middle C”. Another shaggy number in the vein of Kimya Dawson and The Moldy Peaches, it finds Einhorn enlisting the assistance of Frankie Cosmos herself, Greta Kline.Take a listen to both below.<span data-mce-type=""bookmark"" style=""width: 0px;overflow: hidden;line-height: 0"" class=""mce_SELRES_start"">﻿</span>Pre-orders for Fvck The Heartache, out July 26th via Gentle Reminder, are now live.Einhorn spoke further to CoS about the pair of tracks, specifically the cities and musicians that influenced him creatively.North Wales:There’s a dour, gray industrial estate just outside the village where my family is from in North Wales. I was walking alongside it en route to Conwy one day, when amidst the concrete I came upon a little patch of grass. An oasis! Just the kind of place I loved when I was in school, somewhere for us teenagers to sit and smoke and snog. I wrote this song as I walked along that day, then demoed it in the converted railway station-house I was staying in right when I got back. We ended up keeping most of the demo tracks for the final version.Glasgow:In the ’00s I was living in Chicago and touring a ton with my old band Scotland Yard Gospel Choir. But I’d head back to Wales to see family every year, and from there catch a National Express coach up to Glasgow, where everything was happening. (For me, at least.) Long vegetarian lunches with Belle and Sebastian, hitting the student discos with Camera Obscura, a coffee with Stephen Pastel, a pint (of lemonade for me) with Arab Strap, sleeping on Butcher Boy’s couch… It was my indiepop mecca! The magic of that time and place will never, ever leave me.Sarah Records:I adore Sarah Records. They were one of the very few near-perfect labels. I met Matt (who co-ran it) at a Trembling Blue Stars show, he was working the merch booth. I was running my own little record label at the time (also called Fashion Brigade), where I released early Scotland Yard Gospel Choir and a bunch of talented friends’ music, before getting too busy with SYGC. I asked him how he did it. “We were just learning as we went along!” he told me. Viva learning as we go along! When engineer Mark Yoshizumi and I were mixing this track, I thought of Sarah’s incredible run of 99 brilliant singles and 1 singles comp- ‘Sarah 100’. I secretly daydreamed that this little 7-inch could be their 101st…Columbia College Chicago’s Music Department:I studied modern music at Columbia; Terry Riley was one of my teachers! I’d spend hours each day in the practice rooms there, each a tiny shoebox with an upright Yamaha piano and no extra room to sneeze. Transcribing jazz solos and imbibing modern classical music for class was fine — better than fine, actually. But what I really loved, what I was truly obsessed with, was stuff like The Television Personalities, The Moldy Peaches and Daniel Johnston. Brilliant artists who were happy with songs ending when they were supposed to end, not hanging around too long and getting stale just to adhere to boring formats of verse verse chorus verse blah blah blah. I wrote “Middle C” in one of those shoeboxes. It’s 23 seconds long, and for better or worse, has nothing more to add.Frankie Cosmos:There’s always some asshole with a tacky badge standing on a G train platform telling anyone who’ll listen that a scene you love is dead. Well, fuck them! There are so many great bands here in Brooklyn right now. And for my money, Frankie Cosmos is one of the best. I recorded the banjos and guitars for this song in my Fort Greene home studio, then Greta and I headed to Mark Yoshizumi’s place in Ridgewood to cut her vocals. Greta loved working with Mark so much that she asked him if she could come by sometime and record some demos. To thank her for singing on my song, I bought her a day in the studio with Mark. Greta being who she is, and Mark being who he is, they turned that single day in the studio into the whole fucking fantastic Frankie Cosmos Haunted Items series of singles!! So even if you don’t like my song for any reason, at least it helped bring those great tracks into the world.",articles40,"['Gospel Choir', 'Elia Einhorn', 'SYGC', 'I’m', 'Frankie Cosmos', 'Dirty Projectors', 'Thor Harris', 'Phosphorescent', 'Kimya Dawson', 'The Moldy Peaches', 'Frankie Cosmos', 'Camera Obscura', 'Arab Strap', 'Butcher Boy', 'SYGC', 'Sarah’s', 'Frankie Cosmos']"
"With Game of Thrones airing its final episode this past Sunday, the music from the beloved HBO show lives on with a new arrangement of the track “The Rains of Castamere” featuring System of a Down singer Serj Tankian.The song appears on the Season 8 soundtrack to Game of Thrones, which is out now digitally and will be released on double CD on July 19th and vinyl later this year.

"This past Memorial Day weekend TekSupport took over Holiday Moutain in the Catskills just a few hours north of New York City for Gather Outdoors. Gather Outdoors boasted a star-studded techno and house lineup including Amelie Lens, MK, Victor Calderone, Jamie XX, Mr. G, Desert Hearts Crew, & many, many more. While the 1st ever edition of this festival didn't go without some hiccups, overall the massive lineup and unbelievable sound made the weekend an absolute blast and hopefully is the 1st of many to come.As I mentioned above, the festival had a few hiccups, as to be expected in their 1st ever edition of the event. Most of the issues came if you were camping as the camping was very chaotic and had little to no organization between the regular campers and the “glampers” who had tents already provided to them. Once you got settled in however, the camping section was really fun. There was a really open and festive environment and the main camping section was literally a stone throw away from the main stage and the Beech stage.The stage setups were good if you were at the bottom of the mountain near the main 2 stages as they were very close to each other yet experience no noise bleed. Stage 3 was the issue as it was at the top of the mountain and you had to walk an insanely steep slope to get up there. They had the chair lift going during the early sets, but when the bigger names came you had to basically decide if you were staying at the top or the bottom.The sound quality on the Beech stage (Stage 2) was absolutely amazing. I'm talking one of the best sound systems I've ever heard at any festival – and that is saying something. There was absolutely no distortion at all and the bass was enough to run through your whole body. The main stage had amazing sound as well, but it just felt much more powerful at the Beech stage as it was a smaller tighter section.With such amazing sound, you could expect that the sets and the music over these two days were absolutely spectacular. Highlighting Day 1 for me was a massive disco-infused house set from Floorplan, an industrial dark tech set from Victor Calderone, a progressive ride through sound with Mira, and a groovy techy house set from Butch. Day 2 had brought me 60 minutes of house mastery from MK, an indie disco jam session with Jamie XX, one of the most unique experiences in music I've ever witnessed with Mr. G, and the weekend ended for me with a pounding techno set from the queen Amelie Lens.Overall, the 1st edition of Gather Outdoors was definitely a success. Once we got past the hiccups it was a super chill vibe with amazing music and amazing sound. Props to TekSupport and I hope to see ya next year! ",articles9,"['Gather Outdoors', 'Amelie Lens', 'Mr. G', '–', 'Floorplan', 'Mira', 'Mr. G', 'Amelie Lens']"
"Taking place in Ibiza, The annual International Music Summit (IMS) Business Report for 2019 has just been released, showcasing a variety of different trends in the Dance Music Community. While many are positive, the prevailing notion is that club attendance, and consequently, DJ pay, has gone down year-to-date. This is reflected in the biggest clubbing destination the US has to offer, Las Vegas.According to this year’s report, fewer people are going to nightclubs and pool parties. In 2016, 15% of visitors to the city said they had been to a nightclub during their stay, which fell to just 7% in 2018. Similarly, the amount of people going to pool parties during the same period fell from 11% to 4%.The top 3 DJ's in the world today are now earning less than they made last year. While this seems completely inconsequential to the rest of us, Tiesto, The Chainsmokers, and Calvin Harris will likely be seeing lower earnings as a result of this drop.However, there are some positives in the report. Underground and traveling artists are seeing more and more recognition and seeing more representation across lineups. Gaming and music has now also come together in a new way, especially with the advent of online music festivals and massive figures like Marshmello.For a deeper look into the data, check out the full report ",articles9,"['Ibiza', 'Tiesto', 'The Chainsmokers']"
"Oddprophet builds on his streak of success today with new single ‘The Star', touching down on Never Say Die's Black Label imprint. Utilising the producer's mysterious tarot-themed branding, ‘The Star' delivers a punchy, bass-fuelled hit that's sure to get blood boiling as festival season continues.This is a track that brings the noise on an astral level, powering through a colossal composition of driving riffs, booming drums and a growling bassline that'll take pride of place on many a late-night dancefloor. As the vocal sample ‘I told you I was serious' echoes out throughout the tune, we can't help but wonder if this hints towards the well-known star ‘Sirius' – completing Oddprophet's vision for the tarot card depicted on the artwork.But there's nothing twinkly about this track.

"The only hiccup of the weekend was the closing of Kinetic Field and Quantum Valley on Saturday night due to high winds. But, after a couple of hours, headliners were let back into the festival to enjoy the rest of the night.Now, I'm usually a bass fan but I did push myself to go to a couple of sets I normally wouldn't. I checked out Charlotte de Witte at Neon Garden and San Holo at Kinetic Field. San Holo's set really brought the magic of EDC alive for me and made me really cherish that I was there. The beautiful stage and the good vibes that come with San Holo had me feeling some kind of way. Not to mention, Charlotte de Witte is a techno goddess and was probably the best introduction to Neon Garden that I could have had.All in all, EDC does an amazing job of making sure there is something for everyone. From bass to techno to hardstyle, no matter what genre of EDM you love, EDC had a packed weekend for you.Now, this may be subjective to this year's festival, but the Flower Tower that spews fire every few minutes was a lifesaver and kept me warm throughout the whole weekend. Nestled right in front of the Parliament Art Car, it's a perfect place to unwind or take a break.In conclusion, EDC is a place like no other. Every festival truly has its own vibe and magic and Insomniac Events has it down to a science. From the golf carts that were transformed into their own little mobile parties to the art installations, I suggest that everyone experiences EDC at least once in their life. The electric sky is a beautiful place and I can't wait to go back.",articles9,"['Quantum Valley', 'Insomniac Events']"

Fans were upset, but certainly supportive as his health and safety always come first. He ultimately left in an ambulance learning that he had indeed broken his ankle.You will see in the footage below that Garrix actually continued his set while standing on one foot, in an act of pure dedication. It's good to see he seemed to have a sense of humor about it as he is smiling during the ambulance ride to the hospital. Say what you will, but he could have easily stopped the show right then and there and not continued. What are your thoughts? Let us know below!Sorry Martijn to hear that your ankle is broken.Hope you are feeling good and please rest.Remember that we love you xx  — praise the lord (@allsmilesasap) https://twitter.com/MGarrixpics/status/1132598082753978369",articles9,['Martin Garrix']
"It feels like it's been forever since DJ-producer, Madeon, has released a new track. Since his popular release “Shelter,” with Porter Robinson, he has remained quiet for some time now. Many fans were expecting an Albums release last year, but, unfortunately, the day never came. Fortunately, it seems like all that is about to change. Recently, Madeon changed his profile picture on all of his social media platforms. Many fans speculated that this was a hint at a possible new album release. Although an album has not yet been confirmed, something new is coming. Today, Madeon posted on his social media a photo of a Madeon billboard directing viewers to this website link, .When you enter the website, you are taken to a page that looks similar to the billboard posted on his social media. On the page is a hidden message written in an unfamiliar text. Once you click on it, the message is then translated into English; the message is the following:TOMORROW MORNING
I’LL PUT OUT A SONG
IN THE REAL WORLDCOME BACK HERE”Finally, after almost three years, Madeon will officially be releasing a new track. Obviously, more is to come from the talented music maker. What is the Good Faith Era? Does this mean a new album? His new live show? Only time will tell. Stay tuned for Madeon's new track.

"Ibiza season is kicking off in Europe, and luckily for  New Yorkers (like yours truly), the island’s most notorious party returns to NY’s most illustrious venue for a two-stage fiesta that will go strong for 10+ hours starting at 6:30 pm on July 27 at The Brooklyn Mirage.Today, elrow announced its phase 2 lineup for their biggest and most vibrant US event to date featuring two of the most prolific producers in house music and legends of New York’s glory clubbing days, Erick Morillo and Roger Sanchez. While Morillo will be making his stateside elrow debut, Grammy winner, and Ibiza staple Roger “S-man” Sanchez will be making his worldwide elrow debut and playing an unmissable house classics sunset set. Hedonistic cultures will collide as East Coast meets West Coast when LA’s renowned burner crew Desert Hearts takes over Kings Hall until early morning. To accommodate the extra talent and fans, Rowllywood will expand into Avant Gardner as well as Brooklyn Mirage.Also announced in phase two are German house and disco don Gerd Janson, French fusion Music Mastering For The Music Industry | EDM Sauce Technasia who will be doing a b2b set with Dennis Cruz, and Spain’s Cuartero who will be going b2b with elrow resident Toni Varga.

"The scene is officially set for one incredible weekend at Randall's Island Park. Gov Ball Music Festival is officially on and I hope you are as ready as I am to make it the best one yet. The event is kicking off in less than a day and it really has everything that an avid festival goer could ask for. All the stops seem to be coming out and are in place to create a one of a kind festival, and what better way to get ready for the event than to go over some essential things that you should take care of and know before you step foot on the festival grounds. —1. Nab your tickets before they're gone..This point should really go without saying, but there are still limited tickets available for the festival so if you planned on going, now is the time to make the move. This is one reminder you obviously shouldn't ignore so grab your tickets from the site. They still have some general and VIP tickets available! Moral of the story is that you should definitely get your tickets now while you still can. They probably won't last for much longer and trust me when I say that you will not regret getting one because this is sure to be a crazy weekend of music!You can grab your passes !2. Transportation details..One very important key to any festival is figuring out how you're going to get there. Luckily for anyone who lives in or is around NYC the festival has made it pretty simple to figure things out. Randall's Island is the host and there are several different ways of getting there no matter what area of the city you find yourself in. From shuttles, to the subway and also to the ferry, the good thing about this festival is that they have provided a lot of options for anyone coming to the event. Personally I'd recommend taking the ferry being that it can get you directly to the festival and also gives the passengers a scenic route overlooking the beautiful sites that NYC has to offer. You can find out more information regarding transportation to the festival !3. Sifting through the glorious lineup..The last and probably most important thing you should really know about is the actual lineup of the festival. It is pretty vital for when you're attending any festival to plan ahead and figure out who you want to see being that some of your favorite artists might just be performing at the same time. There are really no worries when it comes to the lineup itself, it has no shortage of great acts and artists. Some of these artists include the likes of Gesaffelstein, Tyler The Creator, Lil Wayne, The 1975, Major Lazer and many more. So if you haven't checked out the full lineup and schedule I would definitely get on that before you make your way to Randall's Island on Friday.  Be sure to check out the full lineup and schedule !—All in all it looks like this weekend is going be pretty insane. It will be a time full of great music, people and vibes. Hopefully you all have read over what I went through in this article and have gotten those things straightened out before you dance your way through the weekend! Enjoy!!",articles9,"['Luckily', 'Lil Wayne', 'Major Lazer', 'Be sure']"
"Recently, there has been much concern as to where Ultra Music Festival will be relocating its home festival. After it’s 2019 edition, Miami officials agreed that the festival would not be returning to its recent new location, Virginia Key, due to many complications that occurred during this year’s event. Afterward, Ultra then chose to move on from Miami, taking not only the world but the city of Miami by surprise.Today, Miami officials gathered together to talk about The famous music festival and it’s official leave from Miami. Many officials agreed that the festival should be making a return to Miami, just not to Virginia Key. Others agreed with the leave and believed that the festival should not make its return. Miami City Manager, Emilio Gonzalez, believed that the loss of The famous festival would make an economic impact on the city. Many officials agreed that the festival was a huge loss and that the city of Miami should lure the festival back to its beautiful city. Ultimately, Gonzalez agreed to re-engage with Ultra about a possible return to Downtown Miami, just not in Virginia Key. Do you think that Ultra can make a possible return to Miami? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

"Over the years, Marco Carola has been a fixation in not only the Ibiza Nightclub scene, but as one of the most sought after DJ's in the World. That said, there are very few parties out there that come close to living up to his staple Music On. The residency at Amnesia has brought in thousands of devout techno fans and left said residence wobbling to their hotels/villas at the later AM hours. So it pains me to say, there is trouble in paradise. The legal battle has been going on for awhile now since Carola announced he would be moving his Music On residency to another international powerhouse club (not to mention, major rival) Pacha. And in classic “you're not better than me fashion”, Amnesia has launched a lawsuit against the DJ, seeking €2.4 million for breach of contract.Carola has already been summoned for an Ibiza court appearance on May 22, 2019 by promoter “It's All About The Music SL”. Well, let me tell ya something, it's clearly NOT “all about the music”. The promoter is looking for Carola to pay millions in “damages” and requesting that assets of his be seized. I have literally no friggin idea what the frick is going on here. I saw Carola play Ibiza back in 2016. It was unbelievable. It doesn't shock me that he switched the location of his residency, this type of shit happens all the time in major Music markets (ie, Las Vegas). But, what I don't get is why one of the most well-known names in the industry is running into a legal battle over the switch (based on breaching a contract). Tisk Tisk Marky. Something must have happened. I can see him jumping to a different venue for more money. But, to breach a contract, be warned by a judge NOT to play said shows at new venue until everything is figured out and then just say “fugit I'm gonna continue to play said shows?” I dunno bruh, seems fishy. DJ Mag Top 100 Results stated “Carola has numerous appearances planned at Pacha and elsewhere on the island through the summer. Lawyers representing Amnesia and It's All About The Music SL say that each party he plays elsewhere will see him break the contract he's signed further, which may incur further consequences.”With no comment yet from Carola, who the heck knows. Sit and wait. If you are going to Ibiza and plan on seeing him perform at Pacha, I really hope it works out for ya because this dude is in a league with very few at the top. Best,
Marc ",articles9,"['Marco Carola', 'Amnesia', 'Amnesia', 'Ibiza', 'Ibiza', 'Amnesia', 'Ibiza']"
"Dallas Cowboys star running back Ezekiel Elliott was detained over EDC weekend after a confrontation with a festival staffer.  Elliot was seen arguing with his girlfriend in a parking lot near the festival around 3am on Saturday morning.  Shortly after, the couple was speaking to EDC staff when Elliott confronted one of them saying “You got something to say!?”  While doing so, Elliott forces the staffer backward until he runs into a metal gate, resulting in the man falling over the gate.  Electric Daisy Carnival security and Las Vegas Metro Police offers responded to the scene and eventually put Elliott in handcuffs.  It was later reported that Elliott was never arrested or formally charged, however.   posted a video of the confrontation earlier today:In a statement on the Dallas Cowboys website, COO Stephen Jones says that “What we are aware of is he wasn't arrested and hasn't been charged.  We'll just continue to gather information, and that's all we can say at this time.”  Ezekiel Elliott’s attorney, Frank Saizano, told NFL media that what happened was a “non-incident”, and was a misunderstanding on the part of EDC’s security.

"Art cars at festivals are underrated and I feel like more people should check them out. Art cars – at EDC Las Vegas at least – give you the chance to get up close and personal with the DJ playing and really feel the music. EDC Las Vegas also proved that you never know who may be playing on one. Alison Wonderland surprised the crowd at the Parliament Art Car after her set on Friday with an all house set.After tearing up the mainstage, Alison decided she wasn't done just yet. Alison Wonderland surprised the Parliament art car and the crowd under the Flower Tower with an hour-long house set. This art car is extra special because festival goers are able to climb on it with the performers and be up close and personal with the DJ.

"New York City's techno & house juggernaut Teksupport are bringing themselves into the Catskill Mountains this Memorial Day Weekend with the 1st edition of the Gather Outdoor Music Festival. With 2 jam-packed days of some of the biggest names in the techno & house scene, we decided to pick 4 sets from each day that are a must-see for us on our journey to the Catskills on Memorial Day. Check out the list below and !Fans of minimal techno legend Robert Hood are surely excited to see Floorplan – the father-daughter duo of Robert and his daughter Lyric. Floorplan will bring an uplifting gospel-inflicted house set that is surely going to have a packed dancefloor.
Son of Israel, proprietor of record label ‘Disco Halal’ and an increasingly influential figure in alternative club culture over the past few years, Moscoman has long been dancing to the beat of his own drum.  The musical boundaries of Moscoman have long since blurred, effortlessly bridging the gap between new-wave, house, techno, trance and a sound increasingly all of his own.
Francesca Lombardo has cultivated a sound of her own, one that represents her multi-disciplinary musical background and transcends the dance floor via an emotional narrative of dreamy soundscapes, stirring melodies and hypnotic rhythms. Expect some deep minimal techno goodness from this Italian born star.
 Matador is a revolutionary live artist with a shining reputation for versatility, whilst never compromising on quaMatador’s breath-taking explosive live shows result in packed crowds and an equally packed touring schedule.
What else can be said about headliner and house music maestro Marc Kinchen, aka MK? Dominating the club and radio waves since the early '90s, I'm sure MK is going to bring us back to the roots of house music with a jammed pack set that personally is my #1 must-see set of the weekend.
The term ‘legend' is often thrown around willy nilly in the dance music realm, but Mr. G, aka Colin McBean, is one of the few who can rightfully lay claim to this accolade. Having been in the game for around 2 decades now, Mr. G is widely considered to be one of the most under-rated artists about, and he will be making his US debut on Sunday, so I mean it's a no brainer.
Canadian Jonny White is now the lone force behind the influential Art Department project that began as a collaborative effort with long-time friend Kenny Glasgow in 2009. The prolific producer’s original production style landed Art Department at the forefront of a major underground music movement, transcending genre barriers and forever altering the landscape of dance music.
Jamie xx established himself as one of the most forward-thinking beatmakers and producers in the electronic realm. His brand of U.K.-garage-inspired club music is something that you don't get much in the US, and he is the absolute master of it to boast. One of the recognizable names in the industry, a Jamie xx live set is something that is rare and not worth missing.

"Anyone who is anyone in the Bass Music realm has probably heard of the always hard hitting and awe-inspiring artist known as Boombox Cartel. He has been such a long standing figure in the EDM scene and continues to push the envelope with everything he's been putting out. It's awesome to see how he's been able to break the rules completely time and time again while also still able to maintain the style and bass music feel we have always known and loved from him. At Boombox Cartel's “Cinco Mode” headline show last weekend at Avant Gardner in Brooklyn, NY I had the pleasure of interviewing him. We went into depth on not only his music but his thoughts on the scene itself and where it stands today. We also dove into important current topics such as mental health in music!—INTERVIEW: -So how is everything?“Good, everything is good! Tired but still going, just doing shows and music. A lot of things happening.”-You excited for the show tonight? “Really excited, I was support for RL Grime, one of my good friends, here not too long ago and it's one of my favorite places to play on the east coast in general. It's really cool now how promoters are allowing me to do my own show here.”-How many times do you think you have played in NYC?“I played the Bassment at Webster Hall a bunch of times and then also Playstation Theater I think for one of those small festivals they have here. I don't really get to the east coast that often to be honest, a lot of my shows are more in the South, Southeast like Florida and all of that.” -So you've obviously been working hard touring and releasing a lot of new music, most of it recently being on the more pop dance, hip hop side of the music spectrum. How do you think your fans have been reacting to the new stuff and how do things feel at your shows? “Well with the shows I've been bouncing between two residencies right now, I have one in Las Vegas and one in Atlantic City and on top of that I'm also doing my own ‘Cell Tour' shows. So I'm trying to balance four styles of shows at the same time. For example this past weekend I did the ‘Cell Tour', today I'm doing ‘Cinco Mode' which is like my own festival and then back on Monday playing at a club in Vegas. I'm trying to keep them all separate, you know I'm obviously not going to play an all r/trap, xtrill set at Marquee in Vegas but I will play that stuff at my own shows. I just really want to keep a balance between all that and it's the same with the music I'm releasing. I've been working on so much music, I not only do EDM. I've co-produced for Nick Jonas and I love experimenting with EDM and it's really cool but there's a lot of a coolness factor behind EDM where you can make something really smart and unique and then just put it out. People would be like ‘oh what is this' but now its like people want a brand behind everything. I'm not trying to do that, I'm just going to put out a good song. If it's underground then its underground, if it's pop and good vibes then I'll put it out. My fans are so nice about it, they really do let me have the freedom and allow me to release whatever I want.”-Going off of music and the scene we're currently in, what are your thoughts on whats been going on today with EDM and everything?“I kind of feel like EDM is in a weird place, there's always like two artists popping off at different times on the same sound, but again that's just EDM. That's what we're here for and it's just really how it goes and that's fine. We're all really just trying to figure out who is the next artist up in dubstep or who will be the next Skrillex for instance. So, being how things are today, I like working with a ton of people and getting them out of their comfort zone. It's not that I'm doing specifically pop, its like I want to get a pop dude to do some EDM or vice versa. Again the goal and what I'm on is to just bridge all different kinds of music and try a bit of everything.”-Back into the new music, what exactly do you have coming up in the near future as far as that goes? “I recently put out the Karra record which has been an ID for a minute. I really just did that for the fans and it actually turns out a lot of people in Japan have been asking for that. I did a song with Bad Bunny and Tory Lanez and it was a straight up summer anthem, like top 40 kind of single but it worked out. The original producers of that track, Breakfast N Vegas, are good friends of mine and they're like ‘yo we pre-released this song awhile ago it was called “Give It Up”, we just want to reimagine it and want to take it like full on EDM or make something in between' so I teamed up with them and then kind of reproduced it. It was a good opportunity with some good people and turned into something pretty new. I also got in the studio with MadeinTYO and made some dubby, trappy kind of stuff and I kind of got him out of his comfort zone. I convinced him to do the song but it was pretty tough cause he just generally wants to make hip hop/rap. We did it though and it just recently came out so yeah really what it comes down to is me experimenting. I think it's a great time to experiment and I don't want to put out the same record over and over again, like ‘Whisper' I only want there to be one ‘Whisper', I only want there to be one ‘B2U', I only want there to be one ‘Jefe' so that's it I just want to keep expanding my sound.”-So I want to know more about your process of creating a song, for example on that Karra track you made. How did that come about, what went into it?“Yeah she was super easy to work with, it started with a center of 4 chords, just got the skeleton of the song first and then the hook inspired the drop and then that's really about it. It was kind of like a two step process. I sent it to her and then she came up with something else that eventually inspired the track even more. It also happened all online, which was the same with my single ‘Whisper'. I never really met these people in person before but they just DM me and they send ideas over which is super cool. It's hard now though because sessions these days are pretty quick, you get into a session with someone and it's like I'll email you something and then peace there really is no time to properly create. With online it's crazy cause we're across the world, we're so far away and our schedule is so messed up sometimes, but you really just take it how it is and listen to what the artist was thinking with their ideas and see if there is somewhere it could go.”-The present music scene has been pretty all over the place as I'm sure you can agree, but what are your thoughts on music as a whole and how do you think things are evolving in the scene today? “Yeah man again it's a weird place, we're only going to find stuff out by trying different things, and I want to touch on the subject of Getter real quick. He was trying to do something fresh and different and he got pushed to the side, he got bullied in a way and it's so sad. I personally don't know him that well but I know he was experimenting on the Youtube side, he was also experimenting on Vine, he's really been everywhere so he wasn't really doing anything different than how he usually does it in the first place. He was just trying a different sound and trying to take it somewhere else, but it's such a weird situation today. I hope he's doing good though.”-Going off that, what are your thoughts on the mental health of our musicians in the state it's currently in? “It's tough man, I mean I even struggle with it a lot sometimes. I could play this show tonight and then I could get 100 tweets saying ‘dude this was amazing' and if I get that one tweet that says some negative stuff that will literally destroy my whole week. It would seriously shut me down so I try really not to go online anymore. I tend to stray away from reading comments, but then again sometimes I befriend some fans who are really supportive and they DM me and they're like ‘yo some people perceive this song a bit differently but I think it's pretty cool, heads up don't go on r/trap' or like ‘heads up don't look at what the blogs are saying'. I can count on those true fans to help me out, but yeah it's tough especially now with all that social media has and the attention its been getting.” -Do you have any strategies for aspiring artists to help them better deal with their mental health in today's social media driven landscape? “Social media can be tough, there could be 10,000 comments and then 1 bad comment and then you immediately hate yourself. That's literally it and it really just takes one, it could be the best thing in the world and everyone could be having a blast but if that one person took something the wrong way then all the excitement is gone. It hurts for sure but you got to be tough, the bullies can only make us stronger.”-So festival season is coming up, which one are you looking forward to the most? “I think EDC Las Vegas and Lollapalooza, those are really at the top of my list right now. I'm really focused on trying to go big, figuring out a way to make the most noise and do something huge is really where I'm at. Last time I played at Lolla was 2 years ago so looking forward to being back there this summer, I played right before Mac Miller. Obamas daughter was also on the stage and secret service was all over my green room. I couldn't even get in it cause there were people everywhere all suited up. Also don't think they were that ok with the name Boombox Cartel, but yeah I had a blast it was insane, crazy show, definitely excited for the summer.”-One last question, which artists do you look up to today and who is inspiring you? “There's definitely a few that I follow. I really like what Eliminate is doing, also this artist Great Dane, both of those guys are definitely keeping the bass scene alive. I also want to say Moore Kismet has been killing it recently, so young but also so talented. Another one would be Billboard. So yeah, I mean there are so many artists out there doing awesome things today it's great.”—What an honor it was to interview an artist that I, and I'm sure many others, have looked up to for some time now. You can obviously tell that he has so much in the works and there is a lot of good music to come. This dude truly has the world in the palm of his hands and rightly so being that he has been working so hard. I'm sure his fans and everyone else in the scene are keen to see where he will take the project next. Also turns out that Boombox Cartel just dropped a new song with the one and only MadeinTYO. It combines some heavy and dazzling bass/electronic work with some scintillating hip hop. Make sure to check that out below!

There is absolutely nothing special or crazy about this song, yet it's nearly impossible not to dance to.

"If you thought you were lacking , fear no more. Kaskade just released his new Albums “Redux 003” and it brings us all of the groovy house tunes we could ever want. We have some known and loved track in this album such as “Fun” and “Tight” but plenty of new tracks as well.“Redux 003” features 18 tracks totaling just over an hour. The album features plenty of solo tracks but offers a good mix of collaborations as well. Expect collaborations from Late Night Alumni, Sara Diamond, Gorgon City and many more.While all 18 tracks are amazing in their own way, a few specific ones stuck out to me.“Go Slow” is a perfect, dreamy song of summer. The album's opening track “On Your Mind” came out before Redux 003, but still impresses and is a great opener for the album. “I Feel You – Sun Soaked” keeps the theme of a summer dream with downtempo drops and smooth vocals.“Dancin” is a deep and dark house collaboration with LoKii. It's the perfect track for a late night warehouse show or if you're just feeling yourself before a night out on the town.All in all, “Redux 003” came out just in time for festival season and we're ready to bop to this all summer long.",articles9,"['Expect', 'Gorgon City']"

"In 2018, Swedish House Mafia returned to the live stage for the first time in several years. The trio, consisting of Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso, and Steve Angello took a hiatus from producing as a group and performing live due to both tensions and burnout. At Ultra 2018, the group once again took to the stage together and announced they were back, for good. Since that moment it seems that all the electronic music community could talk about was the return of Swedish House Mafia. After a few more months of waiting, the guys held a PR & Press Release conference explaining that they were working on new music as well as a world tour. Tour dates have slowly started to leak out since, with Swedish House Mafia scheduled to appear at a litany of festivals this summer across the globe.

"News has broken that Russian producer, ARTY has officially filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement against Marshmello. The suit stems from the similarities in melodies on ARTY's official remix for One Republic's massive hit, ‘I Lived' and Marshmello's Charts-topping hit with Bastille ‘Happier.' The , after confirming it with ARTY's Nashville based copyright lawyer, Richard Busch. Busch is one of the biggest heavyweights in the musical intellectual property game, having secured wins for Marvin Gaye's estate against Robin Thicke for his track ‘Blurred Lines'. ARTY's remix was released nearly five years ago in 2014, and since that time, ARTY and marshmello have crossed paths several times.

"The trap god known as Troyboi seems to always be on point, providing his fans with countless works of art and the most inherently energetic shows one could imagine. He has been on an absolute rampage recently playing at some of the biggest venues around the world while also continuously releasing quality music. This past Friday I had the pleasure of attending his show at the famed and recently reopened Webster Hall in New York City. It was an event quite similar to probably every other show Troyboi has played at; giving everyone in attendance something to talk about and providing us all with an endless well of uplifting entertainment. The room was undoubtedly electric, with the crowd already feeling the good vibes being that one of the most prestigious venues in the world is officially back. Everyone was excited and ready for something big to happen, the fans that came got a show filled with eclectic hip hop, grimey bass and the filthiest of beats. Good music came through in great quantities and Troyboi wasn't the only one providing the memorable sounds. At the event there were also a plethora of other talented artists performing as well. Each brought their own unique style and signature sound to the show. These acts included Infuze, upcoming Indian artists Argenil, icekream, rapper HealthyChill and vocalists Nina Sky. So as you can tell the night was jam packed with the most perfectly curated music, giving the audience a different but welcoming style at every corner.It was a night to remember filled with moments that I'm sure most of the fans will not forget.

But, Ultra has “voluntarily terminated” their license before the meeting happened.Leading up to this years event, there was quite the debate from the Miami City Council against Ultra about where the festival was going to be held.

"In a headline that reads like the opening line of a Netflix EDM Documentary that will drop next year around this time, Woodstock founder, Michael Lang plans on raising $30 Million by this Friday to save his 50th-anniversary event. The news comes after the event was reported to be canceled last week after investors pulled the plug due to a litany of logistical problems that seemingly had no resolution.Lang soon fired back a few days later with his own PR & Press Release…that was actually a screenshot of his iPhone's notes app, explaining that the event was not dead despite now having no funding. Many outlets have reported the similarities between the ill-fated, and now universally mocked Fyre Festival and Woodstock 50. The only difference is that while Fyre Festival is falling apart in the dark, Woodstock 50's failing is taking place in plain sight of the public. Michael Lang has still not secured many of the necessary permits needed to host the event and tickets failed to move at a staggering price point of $450. It seems that while there is a small hope that Woodstock 50 might recapture the magic of what happened in 1969, voices across the industry seem to echo the same DAW – “let it die, and don't fight it.” that it is now clear that Michael Lang is not heeding the warning of his peers, as he has unveiled a plan to raise $30 Million by this Friday to save the festival.  Will this play out okay? Only time will tell. ",articles9,['iPhone']
"Avengers: Endgame is one of the two things anyone can seemingly talk about on social media lately. Avengers, and Game of Thrones. Since Game of Thrones already has its foot in the EDM world with Hodor now being an internationally touring DJ, it was about time that the Marvel Cinematic Universe got in on the action. Today, that finally happened, as W&W took it upon itself to step up and create a truly epic remix. While this one will almost definitely never see release due to Sync issues, the possibility exists for W&W to drop it as a free download. Considering they most likely will want to keep it as an exclusive for their sets, we doubt that will happen either. Regardless, this is a real show-stopper. Check it out below, along with some trance inspired cover art.  A post shared by  (@wandwmusic) on  ",articles9,"['Endgame', 'Avengers', 'Today']"
"Australian DJ Adam Sky has died as a result of injuries suffered from trying to help an injured friend over the weekend.  Sky, whose real name was Adam Neat, witnessed his friend and personal assistant Zoia Lukantceve fall several meters from their private pool area at the Hillstone Villas Resort in Bali.  In an effort to save his friend, it is believed that Sky smashed through a glass door, causing severe cuts to his arm which led to his death.  Adam’s team posted a statement on his social media pages confirming his death.  “It is with great regret that we can confirm Adam Neat was involved in a fatal accident while trying to help a friend who had suffered multiple fractures in Bali on Saturday 4th May 2019. Relatives and friends of Adam are travelling to Bali today and handling all arrangements. We ask you to respect the families privacy at this moment while we all come to terms with our tragic loss.“Adam Sky was one of Asia’s top DJs and has supported artists like David Guetta, Afrojack and Paul Oakenfold.

" is an epic track released by NGHTMRE and A$AP Ferg. But, it didn't tack long for fellow DJs to make the track their own. Flosstradamus has done just that with his new remix of “Redlight”. Adding in fast-paced rises and drops that ride on the tracks original sounds, he has truly made this track his while keeping the original integrity of the song.Flosstradamus has taken the track and transformed it into a heavier EDM track. For example, he's taken what was a rap-heavy track and added in drops and build up to add to the over dynamic of the song. The originality of the track is still there, with just a little new flare. Bassheads and A$AP Ferg fans finally have a track they can get down with together.",articles9,['Bassheads']

"It's New Music Friday and that means there is new music for everyone! One of the many tracks that we have all been blessed with today is Nitti Gritti and Gammer's new single, “Underdogs.” As many of you fans know, this new single has been one of the most anticipated releases since 2018. After a long time of waiting, it is finally here. The two talented artists have truly come together to make a new spontaneous dance track. At first, when listening to the single, you are unsure how it is going to go due to its melodic buildup. Afterward, the track transitions into a powerful breakdown containing some dubstep and hardstyle elements. Surely, you can imagine what that must be like. We can't wait to see what more is in store for Nitti Gritti and Gammer. If you are ready to annihilate the dancefloor with this future banger, then make sure to PR & Press Release the play button below. ",articles9,"['Surely', 'Nitti Gritti']"
"The Dj/producer known as JOYRYDE has become famed for his incredibly powerful music and his clean and crisp productions. He has on countless occasions provided us all with tracks full of blistering bass and grooves unlike anything else. He recently took to instagram stating that he has postponed the release of his next single “Selecta” which was expected to come out tomorrow. This is coming in the midst of JOYRYDE's whole Albums campaign, set to be released sometime this year. Yes, this can come across as bad news but honestly I feel like you really have to respect this move that JOYRYDE is making. Unlike most other artists who constantly try to push music that they aren't 100% down with, JOYRYDE has turned a corner by making a conscious decision to postpone the release because of the fact that he doesn't feel it is entirely representative of his talents. What do you think about this sudden move? Check out JOYRYDE's full insta post on it below… A post shared by  (@enjoyryde) on  ",articles9,"['JOYRYDE', 'Yes']"
"elrow returns to Brooklyn Mirage on July 27 to continue its New York City residency and announces its phase one lineup featuring two of the biggest names in house music,  Erick Morillo for Rowllywood, a Bollywood-themed extravaganza. DJing for nearly 30 years, mixing house, techno, tribal, and Latin sounds in his music, the founder of the highly influential label Subliminal Records has become a fixture at top clubs all over the world. In what promises to be one of the biggest New York shows in quite some time, this will be the first time the hometown legend plays elrow stateside.To accommodate additional fans and to add yet another dimension to the revelry, the 10-hour outdoor gathering will expand indoors with West Coast Burning Man-style party collective Desert Hearts (Mikey Lion, Lee Reynolds, and Marbs) taking over Kings Hall. The Desert Hearts ethos aligns perfectly with elrow’s free-wheeling, fantasy-driven spirit and makes for a natural collaboration that offers adventurous music fans an immersive experience unlike any other on the party circuit.Rowllywood’s talented roster also features tech-house favorite Dennis Cruz, elrow resident Toni Varga, UK sensation wAFF, and a special birthday celebratory set by Miss Jennifer. Rounding out elrow’s phase 1 announcement are special guest Bontan, a b2b set between psychedelic synth heads Rybo and Lubelski, and a set by Israel’s Shalev. Altogether, the lineup offers a kaleidoscopic soundtrack for elrow fans who have come to expect the best in international entertainment.elrow’s Special Advisor to the CEO Michael Julian states, Themed after a Bollywood film production, Rowllywood will feature a mind-blowing set — embroidery, incense, statues of deities everywhere, and a spectacular Taj Mahal with a pantheon of gods and goddesses overlooking the fun. Thrown into the party are snake charmers, fakirs, street traders and, if his carpet doesn’t get testy, maybe Aladdin will fly in from Persia for a good time. The film directors will be following you with their cameras, so it’s time to put on your veils, saris, henna and silk. You are center stage in this mega production and Mumbai is waiting. Following 3 sold-out shows at Brooklyn Mirage and Avant Gardner, elrow is once more expected to sell out this event.",articles9,"['Lee Reynolds', 'Kings Hall', 'Israel’s Shalev', 'Taj Mahal', 'Thrown', 'Mumbai']"

"SLANDER and Dylan Matthew are back with a brand new collaboration “Love is Gone”. The pair have teamed up before on collaborations such as “Without You”, “Hate Being Alone”, “First Time”. In this new track, Matthew's vocals bring the emotions with his incredible lyrics on top of SLANDER's beautiful production skills.This track is definitely worthy of chills. SLANDER always does an amazing job of including just enough high paced come ups and drops, as well as Relaxing Music interludes. It's easy listening but also the perfect track to get down to this summer.This release was a big deal for the duo because along with the track dropping, so did SLANDER's first ever Music Videos. The music video features beautiful shots of an astronaut in outer space that pairs perfectly with the track. We're sure we will be seeing this as the visuals for this track during festival season.SLANDER has been killing the collaborations in 2019.

The first track, “Mutation”, captures the classic Midnight Tyrannosaurus sound. Starting out with an eery intro, full of growls and a build up as great as the drop, Mutation is a killer track.Midnight T brings out the drums in “Banana Planet”. The song is introduced with some beautiful drum work with segways into his signature heavy drop. As if the bass wasn't already heavy enough, Banana Planet features a heavy bass undertone that carries throughout the whole track.“Styx” is different from anything I've ever heard from the DJ. It features deeper dubstep sounds that aren't as crazy as we're used to – but definitely feature the heavy bass we know and love from Midnight T.Midnight T definitely has a distinct sound in his music but knows how to play with it in order to keep things interesting.

Boredoms – Rat Soup [Avant]Our guest this week is Finland’s Crystal Cage. An artist who appeared on my radar earlier this year with his self titled debut, self released in April 2018. Based in Finland, theirs is a sound described as a combination of black metal, early 90s techno and jungle, with some Gothic minimalism thrown into the mix. In the vein of 80s UK group Cranes. Cage tell me this informed the vocal structure and style of the first album, and the later blockiness of the structure, usually without a chorus, because they say everything is the chorus.The music released under the project morphs stylistically as it develops. The most recent material of which channels influence from the Berlin school, notably of Tangerine Dream’s Edgar Froese, with drone, industrial and noise elements thrown into the sonic soup.Cage tell me in their next wave of releases they: “intend to shift back to a more melodic space, before going full on minimal and harsh. Themes for tracks have been Occult from the start with combination of dreams and stories from past. Later ‘prophecies’ from the future, pass life (not past but what comes after).”Video plays a big part of the project, with videos for every track on the project’s first album. Cage consider their best videos are for II. In keeping with the music, the project’s design aesthetic is worth highlighting. All done by Cage it beautifully fits the sonic journey. Coming up later this year is a split release with death of codes called Romance At The End Of The World. Each will edit the others work on the recordings. –

In session this week we present Vacated.Vacated’s Rich Wilson has been a supporter of the show for years, resulting in him sending in material he had been working on. We worked together releasing his brilliant track RM2 (re-edit) on our compilation EP Mechanistic Overlap alongside Matt TdK, Lag & Forest People, and Ruins. We’ve got a couple of copies of that one on vinyl in our store. At the same time he released with Power Vacuum, sharing vinyl real estate with Jerome Hill, Cylob, Anklepants and Cornwallis for their second Vectors compilation.From 2013-2015 Wilson presented the radio show We Have Vacatedself releasing a few EPs worth of tracks and building up his studio at his home in Essex. You can expect a return to Darkfloor Sound soon.The session he and we share with you today is the result of these machines in action – stompy, acidic, raw, machine flexing techno fun.–

"Hey, WTF? Is an affiliation with the Sub Pop label THAT powerful, or is  enough of an achievement that even boomers are reentering “the scene” for the sake of all that 70s-style folk-ing? Chances are it’s a mixture of both when it comes to explaining Natalie Mering a.k.a. Weyes Blood’s recent — and still-rising — popularity. (And hey, what a coincidence: mixture, paradox, and purgatory are some of the themes presented on Weyes Blood’s latest album!) All this hoopla means that early fans of Weyes Blood (going back to ) will have to come to terms with the fact that she’s now selling out multiple larger-scale shows. That probably explains why she’s just announced her “Something to Believe Tour,” which is supplementing the late spring/early summer tour that’s . The former will begin merely a month after the latter ends, and it’ll include dates in both North America and Europe. So, Mering is basically doing two international tours more or less back-to-back.

"There’s something so admirable and comforting (and a little envy-inducing) about someone who does things  every time out. With pressures to conform and compromises to be accepted at every turn, it takes a singular stick-to-your-guns stance to get things done “your way.” Since 2001, Brooklyn’s finest funk purveyor, , has seen its unique vision grow into an influential and international success, without ever betraying its ideals. The house of soul will release “Hey Brother (Do Unto Others)”/”Soul Fugue” as a standard black vinyl 45 and a Daptone logo die-cut picture disc (and digital single) as its  on June 28. In celebration of this announcement, the label is sharing the record’s B-Side today, a horn-heavy mammoth by the star-studded supergroup, The 100 Knights Orchestra. The Orchestra’s “Soul Fugue” features EVERY HORN PLAYER THE LABEL HAS EVER WORKED WITH. That means members of The Dap-Kings, Antibalas, The Budos Band, Menahan Street Band, The Extraordinaires, The Soul Providers, and The Daktaris. Recorded with all participants present on February 29, 2016, the track is a Fibonacci-themed instrumental written and arranged by Daptone ace Bosco Mann, with brass and woodwind players battling out the musical thought from the left and right speakers respectively.The A-Side, credited to The Family Daptone, features the cream of Daptone’s vocal crop, including Saun  Starr, The Frightnrs, James Hunter, Naomi Shelton, Duke Amayo, Lee Fields, and the late Charles Bradley and Miss Sharon Jones. Originally found on The Frightnrs’  album, “Hey Brother (Do Unto Others)” was re-recorded after the tragic passing of Frightnrs frontman  as an expression of togetherness and gratitude, a love letter to the label’s fans, and an ever-lasting tribute to those lost from the Daptone family.The single is available ONLY at the Daptone .

"You can’t always freely decide where you want to tour; fans have to be made, bills have to be paid, and bosses have to be obeyed. But to deliberately choose to spend over two weeks in the unfriendly confines of Canada, where the temperature never gets above -20 degrees Celsius (whatever that is) and where beer and weed is rarely consumed? Well, that’s just plain madness!  No, take it from a lad from the land with a universal, publicly funded health-care system:  — the band of brothers   — will have no trouble finding suds and buds north of the 49th parallel when they hook up with doom doyens  for a coast-to-coast Canadian tour in balmy September. Jennings, Lain, and Van Carney will hit the Great White North for a tour beginning in Victoria on September 1, ending in Halifax on September 16, and hitting most of provinces along the way (no Newfoundland, P.E.I., New Brunswick, or the Territories this time around; curiously, no Toronto show either).

"A literal cleric coined the saying that “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.” Thus, one might be inclined to consider it a case of unusually particular divine intervention that Lorenzo Senni and Ivan Olegovich (a.k.a. Regular Citizen) happened to correspond amid a notable resemblance in trafficked sounds. Senni himself coined a term for his own style in “pointillistic trance,” and in listening to Regular Citizen’s debut album — entitled  and out May 31 on Senni’s Presto!? label — it’s hard not to notice the stabs that aren’t a far cry from the ones also breaking skin on Senni’s old school (2014) album, . The respective stories of the two producers are different enough. Somehow they came up with the same denominator, while Mark Fell and SND look on and nod approvingly in the British shadows.Concerning Olegovich’s story, official press tells us that he grew up in the Russian port city of Nakhodka, which is in a seemingly unbelievable location between the Koreas and Japan. Olegovich’s experiments with music began as a kid, when his father bought him an old piano, and since that time, stints playing drums in punk bands and DJing locally have ensured something of a well-rounded, let’s say, musical education. Will Regular Citizen’s next album be an evolution of his calmer pointillistic sound?Stay tuned, but also feel free to pre-order the current one!

With the help of Dawit Eklund of 1432 R, Motion Graphics, Jeremy Hyman, Jordan GCZ (Juju  Jordash), and Gigi Masin; the pair concocted a strikingly seamless, improvised fusion of wispy laptop ambient, jazzy percussive waterfalls, and prancing techno with academically-minded experimentalism lurking in the background.

"Is it just me, or have melody and chord progressions started to feel tiresome? Artists on techno’s vanguard seem to agree, as the atonal sounds of deconstructed club and hard drum music continue to build their respective followings. After all, who’s stepping to the dance floor just to appreciate the orchestration? Acts like Lithuanian producer DJ JM — whose work fits neatly into the hard drum camp — engage in their own brand of populism, reducing their arsenal to nothing but a digital drum kit. It’s a reclamation of dance music as a utility: New Sincerity’s tentacles on DJ decks. To prime the populace for his upcoming  EP, DJ JM has shared “Ray Mound,” a study in industrial clangor and careful restraint. The track doesn’t merely compel you to dance. It’s so commanding — so like an alarm or forward march — that listeners might fear the consequences if they  oscillate wildly. releases on June 21 on 12-inch/digital via Nervous Horizon.

"Previously thought dead and buried, the fully-breathing and thriving Sleater-Kinney have returned once more with a fresh single. “Hurry On Home” marks the beloved band’s first piece of music from a new album — both  called  and coming out via Mom + Pop — their follow-up to 2015’s post-hiatus rocker .While it should be clear from the go that it is indeed a Sleater-Kinney song, “Hurry On Home” has an added level of near-apocalyptic urgency to it that distinguishes it from the rest of their catalog. This is probably because it was — along with the rest of new album — produced by St. Vincent.If you had previously imagined a super-hero team-up between Sleater-Kinney and St. Vincent, it would probably (and I mean this in the most  of ways) come pretty close to sounding like “Hurry On Home.” Working together seems to have layered a new sonic palette on top of a familiar sonic dynamic, and the result is ear-catching, and makes the prospect of a full album’s worth of collaborations exciting.You can listen to and watch the Miranda July-directed lyric video for “Hurry On Home” down below. While there, you’ll also see the band have announced a bunch of dates for this fall where they will play this new song live, presumably along with at least like three to four others.

Some people, of course, are naturally uncomfortable looking into the eyes of people for periods of time that would seem to necessitate a potentially awkward make-out session, and that demographic was probably only  with seeing Angel Olsen perform while she was on her  last year.

Though they may all be beautiful, all may be released on June 7, and all may be limited editions of only 200 or 250 copies; only ONE of them will be “the one” for you. So, step right up and get ready for love! Let’s meet these three lovely ladies!Bachelorette Number One is the first release from ’s violinist since the 1960s! A collection of 17th-century works of the Italian Barouqe, this record finds Michel Samson performing with his wife, Rebecca Samson, who plays what is believed to be the only existing replica of the rare, bizarre 15th-century claviorganum. This is one romantic dreamer, with nothing more than a “one true love” at its heart! Give it up for !Bachelorette number two is a clever, vague, and overall scheming little thing. This keyboardist’s first encounter with McCann — when McCann saw him perform in 2010 — was described as “a thick ocean of chords, a penetrating grace that I can still recall.” WOWIE ZOWIE! That’s some hot stuff! This is a record that will spin you around, leave you breathless, and then kick you to the curb! Get those engines revving for !Finally, Bachelorette Number Three is the perfect fit if you prefer a day of reading by your windowsill instead of a night out on the town. This collection of recordings from 1974-1981 finds an all-American poet, visual artist, and vocalist melding together and bridging between both observational recordings of the artist’s loft and intimate multichannel solo voice works. Don’t let the outside fool you! This wonderful catch is full of dense and deep wonders. Let me hear it for !So, my friend, what’ll it be? Do you prefer the swoon-y, wishy-washy loveboat of ?

" reads the stitching on an impossibly-long poodle skirt. Here at the SadGirl sock hop, fractal patterns manifest in strawberry malts while the checkered tile floor suggests something more harrowing than 1950s kitsch. “Miss Me” is the Californian trio’s second single from their debut  LP, out next month via Suicide Squeeze. It’s a loosely conceptual record about Los Angeles’ rise to metropolitan prominence and the inkling of looming tragedy that has always seemed to undercut it all. Earthquakes and wildfires threaten to punish oceanfront dwellers and residents of hillside mansions for their pride. West Coast dreams go unrealized. SadGirl’s songcraft attempts to bring the Promethean jadedness of the 21st century back in time to the boomers. Ever see that   about the folly of re-visiting the ice cream sodas and fairgrounds of one’s childhood? I get that same parallel sense of nostalgia and dream from “Miss Me.”“This song is about realizing someone close to you isn’t the person you thought you knew and kind of coming to terms with the fact that they may never share the same values as you,” says vocalist Misha Lindes. “Getting to that point where you decide that it’s no longer worth the effort and it’s better to walk away with what’s important to you still in tact.”Pre-order  ahead of its June 14 release date , and get intimately acquainted with “Miss Me” right now down below:  tracklisting:01.

Gel Set) and Whitney Johnson (a.k.a. Matchess) to band up for a slew of live shows, and eventually, an album. Now, the two electro artists are about to release their newest collaborative tape as Simulation, , coming June 21 via Hausu Mountain. Callier and Johnson, known for introspective synth-driven dance music and meandering ambient noise, respectively, together deliver a vision of deconstructed-yet-melodic avant-garde sonic playgrounds, somehow concurrently hinting at choral music, EBM, and industrial. While both share vocal and production duties equally, Callier takes care of the electronics while Johnson handles the more traditional instrumentation. All in the service of laying out “a view of modern life equally blessed and encumbered by the capabilities of constant interconnectivity.”The tape (as well as its digital image in the obscure “MP3” format) can be pre-ordered .

"Normally, albums of the darker variety leave it up to the listener to imagine a scenario where demons exist and are planning to imminently borrow your soul for a midnight dip in Lake Hellfire, but this new release from Jim Mroz — a.k.a. Lussuria — heightens the creepiness by offering a vivid and even  scenario for you to envision ahead of any ambient complement.  is set for release May 31 on Lussuria’s reliable label partner, Hospital Productions, and the name of the album comes from a recent experience where Mroz’s grandmother was hospitalized with a mysterious allergy. You can read Mroz’s more detailed description of the serious event  — but perhaps the kicker of it is, Mroz’s grandmother attested to hearing three knocks at her door just prior to when she fell ill. “She discovered that these knocks were meant to be fatal and a mockery of the Holy Trinity. One knock for each crucifixion.”Alternatively, when I order something online, the people from FedEx or UPS frequently knock, place the package outside my door, and then leave before I have the chance to cordially greet them and verbally express my thanks for their delicate parcel delivery. A removed opportunity for interpersonal connection is arguably just as scary as omens stemming from ancient crucifixions, so perhaps Lussuria was previously inspired by all  of Lyft drivers disinclined to chat?Listen to the title track below and decide for yourself (either way, it seems like Mroz has a handle on this whole “bizarre objects and field recordings” thing).

"The time has come for one of our Top 5 Living Australians, Oren Ambarchi, to follow-up his 2016 LP  with a brand new slice of full-fucking-length studio-recorded music. Of course, I’m not forgetting about his numerous collaborations and guest appearances with , , and , but this is going to be a PROPER solo album. Actually, scratch that:  is a collaboration with the legendary Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista; and it’s out on July 5 via Editions Mego. Speaking of all things Brazilian: unlike the “spectacular explorations of relentlessly driving rhythms” of Ambarchi’s previous three records, the new LP will find him exploring his lifelong but not-easily-observable affinity for the musical tradition of the South American country. With Baptista supplying a chunk of the Paulista soul (a.k.a. *the beats*), Ambarchi is planning on both revisiting the “spacious canvases of classic releases like Grapes from the Estate” and concocting “an abstracted, splayed-out take on the 80s guitar-synth work of Pat Metheny or Bill Frisell.” Honestly, no Oren Ambarchi press release has ever sounded better to me than that.

"It’s a testament to the overwhelming plethora of music being made that I can go years without having heard of Alex Cameron, despite the fact that his candid lyrics and glam-adjacent melodies have earned him more than a few fans in a relatively short amount of time. One could also attribute his rise to the Angel Olsen , or the fact that he’s toured in support of the equally quirky Mac DeMarco; but the appeal starts to become especially obvious once you acknowledge and appreciate the songwriting on his most recent album , which came out on the Secretly Canadian imprint in 2017. There’s just something  about a contemporary rendition of Bowie who sings honestly about internet porn and makes a metaphor out of underwear skid marks!If this is what you’re looking for in your music these days, good news! Cameron’s video for his newest track “Miami Memory,” watchable below, highlights the Sydney-born musician’s first new music since , though Jemima Kirke’s physical presence dates back a fair amount of time.

"Normally when the question “what is love?” enters the millennial brain, immature flashbacks of Will Ferrell  naturally take over in lieu of a deeper or more intellectual train of thought. But most interviews attest to Actress (a.k.a. Darren Cunningham) having a brain that’s seemingly immune to this kind of impulse — which might explain the creative direction that he’s clearly taking with the aforementioned question. First, influential German composer Karl Stockhausen created the opera , in which the first scene, entitled , entailed the “World Parliament” having a debate  about the nature of love. Stockhausen was reportedly the first classical composer that Cunningham explored parallel to his highly-praised exploits in electronic music; and now, the London-based artist is apparently bringing things full-circle. (Although, come on: who’s  surprised by an Actress re-work of an opera?) is set to  May 14 at the Royal Festival Hall in London, and according to Cunningham, it’s both an intro to Stockhausen and a reflection on the  political climate vis-à-vis . This new opera features contributions from pianist Vanessa Benelli Mosell, the Netherlands Chamber Choir, and conductor Robert Ames. In addition, an AI project called Young Paint (developed by Dr. Louis Busby) apparently has a role that remains semi-mysterious. Recordings of current MPs are incorporated, Actress is the mind behind the project, and Southbank Centre and Holland Festival helped with the financingno, wait! Don’t click away!

"Sure, you’ve heard percussion before. Thinking about all your favorite drummers, no doubt certain specific sounds echo through your head. “Ba dum tss,” or “Fssssssss SPROT,” sometimes “wowowowo rahhh, wowowowo Zahhh Zong,” or even “pikapika, pikachu.” Common sounds we’ve all heard emanating from, say, a rack tom.Well, get ready to have your conceptions of percussive audio  with , the latest album from avant-garde percussionist Jon Mueller. is a work composed of gongs, voice, and percussion.

"Flying Lotus was briefly and naturally away from the touring game while he focused on bolstering Brainfeeder’s horrific cinematic chops, so the last time you saw him in a live setting might’ve been in 2017 — back when the times were simple, cats and dogs had amiable conversations in an undiscovered language, and 3D was enjoying its twilight as a thing on which people readily sought to visually feast. Personally, I don’t think 3D really enhances much in a movie theater setting, but what Flying Lotus  a year and a half ago (and even on tours prior to that, iirc) was a crazy display that transplanted audience members into a believably extraterrestrial territory. Supplementing the 3D visuals was a remarkably abstract set, which surely must’ve disappointed a few folks who were anticipating and interpreting “instrumental hip-hop” in its most banger sense. (A more confrontational FlyLo might’ve responded, “Don’t you know ?”)In case you missed it, he’s the guy with the  coming out May 24 on Warp, and now he’s got plenty of supportive North American tour dates scheduled for around the end of summer.

"In my early TMT days, I once described the music of Loke Rahbek (co-founder of Posh Isolation and co-Damien Dubrovnik producer alongside Christian Stadsgaard) as inescapably . If Rahbek has spent the last years serving up the feeling of cold wind against your skin, then Stadsgaard’s newest — and  — solo EP as Vanity Productions is serving up the contrasting feeling of warmth under your scarf and wool gloves where you know you’re protected from the outside winter.“Showtime Revision” is a track from the EP — which is titled  —  and it’s streaming below with a duly sentimental video from Anastasia Karkazis. The track conjures up moments of heartbreaking nostalgia and soul-crushing empathy in a way similar to the films of American existentialist Don Hertzfeldt, with flickering sonic waterfalls that swell and decay all at once.

It received a rave   upon its release, and landed at number 12 on our year-end  of the 50 best releases. To  prove our love though, we are now devoting a whole  post to Holter’s announcement that she is adding around a dozen or so shows to her already  revealed tour dates!Following dates in Europe that hit up some of the continent’s biggest festivals — Primavera Sound, Roskilde, etc. — Holter will be coming back to North America to play some places she missed earlier in the year. This includes a set at the preeminent festival named after a publication owned by the Condé Nast media conglomerate — Ars Technica Fest, of course — as well as stops in Nashville, Tijuana, various Texas cities you’ve probably heard of, and more. All of these shows will feature Holter performing as part of a six-piece band that includes a diverse array of instruments such as flugelhorn, viola, and bagpipe.

"Well it’s about TIME. Veteran rippers of the heavy avant-garde, Boris, have (finally) announced their twenty-fifth album, “LφVE  EVφL.” The two independent works that make up the release zero in on “conflicting connotations that interweave and become intricately entangled with one another, gradually eroding before becoming utterly singular.” So basically, the Japanese trio’s version of Speakerboxxx/The Love Below will be out in August on Third Man Records. Right around the time of the release, Boris will embark on a gargantuan, 30-date tour around the US, Canada, AND Mexico; NYC industrial outfit Uniform is going to support (aside from the Mexico City date). Additionally, to commemorate their new partnership with Third Man, the band is going to re-issue their 2003 albums  and  with the label later this year. And that’s…all the info we have so far.

"Heads up, psych-heads. Your favorite Athens, Georgia-based psych-head, Michael Potter, is about to do something. You may not be surprised at what that something is, because that something is something he does quite often, especially considering that he’s the head honcho at tape labels  and . If you can believe it — and honestly, I’m really trying not to be overwhelmed with my non-disbelief here — Potter’s going to release a new tape in the very near future. June 7, in fact.The crazy part about this is that he’s not releasing said tape on either NULL|Z0NE OR Garden Portal, and that’s kind of blowing my mind a little bit. It’s coming out instead on Atlanta label . Why on earth would you DO that? I mean, the only reason I could think of is if there’s an upcoming tour or something, and you don’t want to do all the promo nonsense for your own work and focus instead on planning for that tour, you may want to have someone else do all the heavy lifting for the release, but…Oh, shoot,  Well shut my mouth, I guess I’ll paste those deets below.Anyway, the tape itself, , is a single 20-minute track that’s sure to wallop you in the drone quadrant of your brain. Anyone coming into this expecting the brilliant  may be disappointed, but they shouldn’t be. This is  people: a tangible growth in character and skill for Mr. Potter, and you shall love it or else .That’s right, I’m the president, and I’m on Air Force One.(I forgot to mention: if you buy this tape, there are THREE secret tracks on side B.

"Typically, threepeats happen over a period of three years. But like some personal deep dish pizza, TREE is slicing that time frame in sixths, with this, his third championship-worthy release in just six months. Mixed metaphors notwithstanding, following January’s  and March’s  the Chicago soultrap pioneer returns May 31 with , a full-length collaboration with New Jersey-based producers Parallel Thought. For those unfamiliar, Parallel Thought is the production duo comprised of Adam Calman and Jeff Blacker, known for their stylistically boundless, yet consistenly immersive work with the likes of Bentley, Gene the Southern Child, Del the Funky Homo Sapien and Tame “Da Ol’ Jersey Bastard” One among others.Titled  after TREE’s old Cabrini Green stomping grounds, this album promises to be remarkable not only for the collaboration, but also for its historic and artistic significance. Per the Bandcamp description, the above album cover photo, showing a young TREE, “was originally taken in July 1988 by famed Chicago photographer Marc PoKempner as part of the Changing Chicago Documentary Project” and “had been hanging in The Art Institute of Chicago for over a decade until a search for album art led to it’s re-discovery.”The album will be released on limited vinyl via De Rap Winkel Records, making it the third TREE release on wax (after 2014’s  and ).

"Gone are the days of Drakkar Noir and demon rock, of making your bucks and shouting about urban decay. Sure, there are still angry young people throwing pungent devil horns with municipally-directed hot hot heat; but for each of these, there are dozens longing to leave rather drab urban surroundings for a more blissful, less bustle, existence in rural contentment, or beyond.This is no more apparent in music where there seems to be a real move away from the trials and tribulations of  everyday city living to, if not the country physically, then to the country of the mind. With influences and improvisation as wide and wild as the ear can hear, this free feeling has struck a chord with many of the acts on the  label roster. It is no real surprise that the new  album is on BBiB, then. It is even less of a surprise that our premiere today of the new Dire Wolves track, , is a 10-minute extended piece and a powerful, mystical journey through time and space.Taken from the forthcoming  album, “Spacetime Rider” is delicately poised between the familiar and the weird.

"The release of  more or less coincided with a slowdown in terms of John Wiese’s musical output, but it’s important to note: hurricanes inevitably ebb and become tropical storms at some point. The number of albums and singles that the LA-based artist released up until 2011 was  to the point of being unsustainable by a confirmed member of the human species; and recognizing the needless pressure that he was putting on himself to propagate multiple times per year, the pace was slowed and more room was given for the visual and graphic design projects that also harness his creative faculties.  Recent releases have been taking the form of more traditional albums, like  or his  with one half of Matmos. This pattern  should be thoroughly celebrated!Perhaps not coincidentally,  remains something of a  deviation for the guy who’s frequently (and justifiably) name-dropped alongside others of international noise legend. Subjective abrasiveness is shockingly hard to come by from the perspective of this admittedly seasoned listener, but only the hardcorest of hardcore-ers would equate the album’s deliberate solemnity with weakness, qualitatively. So it’s worth a re-visit.Accordingly,  will be reissuing  as a 2xLP on July 1. Supposedly Side D will have all new material, so that’s pretty sweet.

"What’s the state of contemporary soul and funk in 2019? Normally, we’d recruit an aspiring musicologist at the local university to answer such a subjective and philosophical genre question — but it turns out none would answer our phone calls, so we can forgo the consulting fees and maternal laundry services in favor of simply using our ears. The Brooklyn-based Daptone Records has made a name for itself both as an outlet for its founders’ releases and those conjured by others on the same soulful wavelength, and apparently, the music exemplified across dozens of releases since 2001 wasn’t just a facade of passionate feeling (not that we ever thought it was). And the Helsinki-based Timmion Records is certainly among several labels with which Daptone has a good relationship; so accordingly, Daptone is sponsoring a new Timmion label compilation called  this summer. Naturally, the album is a reflection of the musical style with which Timmion has principally concerned itself since its inception (around the same time as Daptone). You’ll find rare tracks from experienced artists like Nicole Willis and Willie West on there.

"Trance luminary Sander van Doorn is back with a brand-new single via his Purple Haze alter ego. ‘We Come In Peace’, his sensational collaboration with Colombian producer KhoMha, is out now via Armind.Chosen as Tune of the Week in last weeks’ ASOT episode, and with Armin van Buuren playing it in his latest North America mini tour, this track is rapidly catching  momentum and leaving fans hooked.Reinforcing the darker side of Sander van Doorn’s and KhoMha’s combined production prowess, ‘We Come In Peace’ is a deliciously dark piece that gradually builds momentum over its near six-minute duration. After setting the tone with a heavy bassline and sparse synths, the duo pick up the pace and lead the listeners into a colossal drop. Brimming with progressive and trance elements, this powerful musical concoction begs to be blasted from the best and biggest speakers on the planet.Hot off the back of his Miami Music Week event, Sander van Doorn Presents 15 Years Identity, and his mini Asia tour, Sander van Doorn has well and truly kept the pedal to the floor this year. Gearing up to present Purple Haze to EDC Las Vegas, and with plenty of new music ready for release, Sander is making every moment count in 2019.Meanwhile, KhoMha hasn’t been sitting still either. The Colombian Trance star, who’s already been a valued part of Armada Music’s artist roster for years, has been turning quite a few heads as a producer with powerful originals, new takes of Trance classics such as Veracocha’s ‘Carte Blanche’ and Vincent de Moor’s ‘Fly Away’, and a big remix for Morgan Page’s new single ‘Gone My Way’. On the live front, KhoMha also wrecked the Road To 1000 stage at A State Of Trance 900 Utrecht earlier this year, in addition to playing at several other big events. ",articles26,"['Purple Haze', 'Armin van Buuren', 'Sander van Doorn', 'KhoMha’s', 'Armada Music’s', 'Veracocha’s', 'Morgan Page’s']"
"It’s not every day that you see two very different legendary artists team up for a common cause, but today is one of those memorable days that dance music fans won’t soon forget – the renowned Dutch DJ and producer Armin van Buuren has taken on the challenge of remixing Van Halen’s classic 1983 smash hit “Jump,” one of the most enduring and timeless singles in rock & roll history.Out today through Big Beat Records, Armin van Buuren puts his signature, uplifting, progressive, trance spin on the iconic rock anthem, kicking off the remix by isolating front man David Lee Roth’s classic verse and adding in arpeggiating synths and cowbell for good measure. Naturally the remix explodes once it reaches the song’s classic chorus, and never lets go from there, steadily building until an unforgettable climax. Who would’ve thought “Jump” could get any more anthemic?!“Jump” is still Van Halen’s most successful single to date, reaching #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 along with being ranked #15 on VH1’s “100 Greatest Songs of the 1980s.” The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum also listed it as one of the “500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll” and its music video was nominated for three MTV VMAs at the time, along with winning “Best Stage Performance.” Armin’s remix of Jump had its first listen when Van Halen front man David Lee Roth came out during Armin’s Ultra Main Stage performance earlier this year for a performance fans still haven’t forgotten.It takes little to recognize that Armin van Buuren is one of the world’s biggest DJs and producers in electronic music for over twenty years. The GRAMMY-Nominated Dutch DJ/producer holds the record for most entries (21) on the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, and has been ranked the #1 DJ by DJ Mag a record of five times. Van Buuren also hosts a weekly radio show, A State of Trance (ASOT), which has 40 Million listeners from 84 countries and 100 different FM stations air the show worldwide. Armin headlines more than 150 shows per year at leading festivals and venues around the world, including Electric Daisy Carnival (Las Vegas, New York), Ultra Music Festival (Miami) and Tomorrowland(Belgium) plus residencies at Hï Ibiza in Las Vegas–the most recent being his residency at KAOS Day club and Nightclub in 2019–and numerous others. With those accolades and a combined social reach of over 18 million and counting, it’s easy to see why van Buuren is one of the most influential figures in dance music history. Impressive, considering he still has many years ahead of him!Artist and innovator David Lee Roth’s creative contributions have broken barriers for over 40 years. As lead singer and founding member of the legendary Van Halen, Roth led the group to two Diamond records (Van Halen, 1984), record-breaking global acclaim, and a place in the Rock n’ Roll Hall of Fame (inducted 2007). “Jump,” from Van Halen’s 1984 album, has been featured in many feature films, including Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One, Despicable Me 3, Sing, Herby Fully Loaded, Big Daddy and Eddie the Eagle. “Jump” has been covered by many top artists around the world, including Foo Fighters (live), Aztec Camera, Paul Anka and others. As a solo artist, Roth has had countless hits including “Just Like Paradise,” “California Girls” and others, along with more than two million records sold. In 1997, he penned his New York Times-bestselling memoir, Crazy From the Heat, and in 2006 created The Roth Show radio series and podcast, which he continues to produce today. Recently, Roth assembled a team of industry experts and creative professionals, to launch INK The Original, a lifestyle brand focused on the preservation and brightening of tattoos.  Musically, his latest collaboration is with EDM artist Armin van Buuren, who’s remix of “Jump” was debuted live at ULTRA Miami in 2019 with a collaborative performance, and has been met with industry-wide recognition. ",articles26,"['Van Halen', 'Van Halen', 'Van Halen', 'Van Buuren', 'van Buuren', 'Van Halen’s', 'Armin van Buuren']"

" Dance music is very often referred to as body music for reasons that are intuitive. In the most literal sense, it moves you, but there's a potential for more, something beyond the sights and smells of the darkened dancefloor. On the cover of the debut LP by the Vancouver techno duo Minimal Violence is an all caps couplet that outlines this whole philosophy: THE BODY IS MEAT / THE MIND IS UNLIMITED. Their album is called  InDreams, and its built around the hallucinatory energy that comes from hardware electronics firing fast and heavy. You want to move, but there's something ascendant about it too. Other producers and DJs have explained this metaphysical rave experience as a way of communing with the divine, but Minimal Violence have it right, comparing it to the world of dreams. Utilizing a ""haphazard"" collection of hardware, they're able to create pieces with surreal logics, interlocking and interacting in ways that shouldn't make sense, linking distant worlds and creating new ones. It's best evidenced on tracks like ""June Anthem,"" which employ melodies catchy enough for pop structures, but twist them around this impossibly fast drum programming. It takes something that feels familiar and turns it into something otherworldly—electronic music as a way of seeing past the mundanity of the physical world.   InDreams is one of the best techno full-lengths in recent memory, so it's exciting that the duo—made up of the producers Ashlee Luk and Lida P.—were able to celebrate it with this week's Noisey Mix. The set they put together is a little different than the record; it's a little slower, a little slinkier. But it's no less transcendent as they transition from the slow motorik of some workmanlike techno, through brutalist EBM, and off-kilter post-punk. It's all heady and heavy, exactly the sort of stuff that'll help you move beyond this meatspace and embrace your psychic destiny. Listen below alongside a conversation with the duo about the philosophies behind their record.  Noisey: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting.Minimal Violence: We’re currently sitting in a cabin at the foot of a ridge in Joshua Tree at sundown listening back to this mix and it feels like the perfect setting. I feel like whenever we are making music or a mix we are thinking about night drives down quiet stretches of roadway, or running. This is not a running mix.  Was there any specific concept to the mix?I find that we have a habit of sourcing new tracks for every mix / DJ set as opposed to going through our archives. Rekordbox was giving us technical difficulties so we started digging through our usb's for tracks that fit a mood we were trying to conjure, slower tracks that we hadn't fit into mixes before and picking through some records. We always try to pay homage to Vancouver’s musical history, aside from that we ended up with an interesting combination of some new stuff alongside some dark post-punk jams next to some untitled break-driven test pressings.  Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?There is this perfect moment at 35:20 of the mix when the tail of Chaos Engine lets out in a scream and the first kick of Oazis comes in that is particularly satisfying.  Is synesthesia a real thing? If so, what color is this mix?We had a sound art class once with a girl with synesthesia, she talked about it a lot. Apparently it's real. I can't say either of us are tuned into that, but if we were then I’m heading towards the feeling that this mix would be purple.  Your record is called   InDreams, can you talk a bit about the power that dreams hold for you either in your lived experience or as a metaphor? Have you had any dreams recently that enlightened you about waking life?At a young age we were both obsessed with the idea of lucid dreaming as a form of escape. I actually recently came across a book I had found as a child titled  Dream Power, that delved into these ideas. I think the commonality of our interest in these experiences with lucid dreaming brought us towards this concept. We both have had dreams recently where the emotional experience within the dreamworld transcended into waking life. I feel like it’s in moments like this where the potential for fluidity between the two worlds most clearly exists.   There's such a bruising energy to much of this record, what draws you to fast tempos and minimal melodies? What feelings or themes does something like ""June Anthem"" allow you to access. Or are you even thinking about it on that level?I think we’re drawn to faster tempos because it allows the potential to be more impulsive and visceral when playing live. There’s a more immediate feeling to how people are experiencing the music and you kind of feed off of it. The interest in melodies ties in with the feelings that are generated by tracks like ""June Anthem."" I feel like there is a certain anthemic quality that we are drawn to— unapologetic melodic leaning that borders on earworm in its ideal state. Melodies help connect you to a time and place, I feel like a lot of dance music lacks this. There is no connection to the psychic/emotional, only the physical.  The cover of the record draws a distinction between physical reality and psychic reality. In what ways is your music invested in exploring that idea? I think it's funny in some ways that techno gets called a kind of ""body music"" but people also talk about it in mystic terms.I think this distinction is something we will attempt to focus on in future works. Right now let’s just say that we’re thinking of, say, the immediate bodily effect of a heavy and steady kick versus the melody that contains a nostalgic quality that might carry you to the first time you ever heard a track. I guess the “body” aspect of techno music is focused on the literal, whereas the “mystic” refers to the transcendental experience many encounter on the dancefloor.  Both of you made music in other projects before Minimal Violence—what do you feel excited about in the music you make together that you haven't been able to capture elsewhere?This project allows us to explore another side of our connection to one another and I feel like that is something that neither of us could ever do within any other projects. There’s a certain kind of brutal honesty that occurs when working creatively with your partner that spares no feelings and pushes you both beyond your comfort zone.Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles2,"['Dance', 'InDreams', '""', 'InDreams', 'Chaos Engine', 'InDreams']"

"Listen to the track belowDid you know that Cardi B hates the press? Especially since gossip blogs clamored to cover the relationship drama between her and her husband Offset last year, she hasn’t been shy about expressing vitriol for thirsty journalists; in her verse on Offset’s recent song “Clout,” she raps, “I should run a whole blog at this rate/They using my name for clickbait.” And just last week, she tweeted an incisive indictment of  ubiquitous internet tabloid very few could argue with: “TMZ gets one piece of information and put legs and feet on that bitch !” But Cardi doesn’t just talk shit unless she intends to back up her threats. On her new single “Press,” her first new solo track since 2018’s “Money,” she wages a full-out war with bloggers, journos, bitches, and anyone else who will stand in her way.If Cardi was giving out warnings on previous singles “Bartier Cardi” and “Money,” she’s now fully ready to take aim at any haters on “Press.” Her bars here are non-stop cut-downs as she pivots from menacing warnings (“Put blood on her dress”) to goofier boasts about her money and sexual prowess (“Money still long like weave/Pussy still wet like Florida”) without hesitation. As if she couldn’t get more to the point, Cardi cuts out all subtlety in the song’s hook;  “Kill ’em all, put them hoes to rest/Walk in, bulletproof vest,” she raps, enunciating her words with a Migosian aggression until each consonant becomes a dagger. Cardi’s used to being in intimidation mode. But on “Press,” she’s sharpened her rapping abilities to deadly effect.",articles4,"['Especially', 'Pussy', 'Cardi', 'Cardi’s']"
"Listen to the track below“I like to do what I’m not supposed to do, and this is the music that feels the truest to me at the moment.” That’s how Miley Cyrus introduced her new rap-adjacent thumper “Cattitude” at last weekend’s BBC Radio 1 Big Weekend festival. She then made tabloid headlines for the lyric, “I love you Nicki, but I listen to Cardi.” This may be the music speaking to Cyrus right now, but it seems like  is speaking to her right now—country-tinged synth ballads, Wu-Tang Clan homages, Mark Ronson collaborations, Billie Eilish-style ASMR teasers, and even  cameos.“Cattitude” is proudly unserious, but it’s also kind of embarrassing. “Turn up your gratitude, turn down your attitude/I love my pussy, that means I got cattitude” packs the energy of a self-help slogan and a rejected Lizzo track. Perhaps anticipating blowback to the pussy hat of pop songs, the version on Cyrus’ new  EP adds an extensive feature from RuPaul, who playfully smuggles in some exploration of genderqueer sex. Shame it should wind up lodged in this mess, where the highlight is, alas, Miley’s interpolation of Missy Elliott’s iconic  in “Work It.” “Cattitude” is entertaining, sure, but who’s being entertained?",articles4,"['I’m', 'Wu-Tang Clan', 'Billie Eilish', 'RuPaul', 'Miley’s', 'Missy Elliott']"

"“We will continue to push for the breaking down of barriers until all people are heard equally across the world”The Elton John biopic Rocketman opened in theaters today, though not all markets screened the same final cut of the movie. As the Guardian and Amnesty International report, scenes in the movie depicting any instances of same-sex relationships were removed in Russia under the country’s “homosexual propaganda” provisions, which were passed into law by President Vladmir Putin in 2013.Scenes depicting drug use were also cut from the Russian version of the movie, according to , while the movie’s end title card—which according to reports, stated that Elton John and his husband and are living together and raising children—was edited to state that the singer-songwriter formed an AIDS foundation.Now, Elton John and the filmmakers behind  have issued the following joint statement, condemning the censorship:We reject in the strongest possible terms the decision to pander to
local laws and censor  for the Russian market, a move we were
unaware of until today. Paramount Pictures have been brave and bold
partners in allowing us to create a film which is a true
representation of Elton’s extraordinary life, warts and all. That the
local distributor has edited out certain scenes, denying the audience
the opportunity to see the film as it was intended is a sad reflection
of the divided world we still live in and how it can still be so
cruelly unaccepting of the love between two people. We believe in
building bridges and open dialogue, and will continue to push for the
breaking down of barriers until all people are heard equally across

"Listen to the track below“Two years and just like that/My head still takes me back/Thought it was done but I/Guess it’s never really over,” Katy Perry sings on “Never Really Over.” Thank god she’s not talking about her  phase, the 2017 album that found her making hackneyed political statements and personal platitudes. Though her last record cycle attempted something approximating depth and maturity, Perry has never really thrived as that kind of pop star. She excels at the kind of sugary megahits that sound like eating frosting out of a jar. Her new single, however, feels like a promising way forward.Produced by Zedd, “Never Really Over” throws in everything but the kitchen sink—ticking clocks, piano chords recalling “Baba O’Riley,” a drumline, a synth-y chorus worthy of a CRJ banger—and ends up with a surprising amount of subtlety. She could have stood to do without the obvious ticking in a song about the passage of time, and the drumline might get her in trouble with the Beyhive, but all in all, “Never Really Over” is her best single since 2013’s “Walking on Air.”Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the lyrics are not horrendously cheesy (a noted weak spot for Perry and her co-writers), instead adeptly capturing the conflicted pull of a love you can’t quit. Everybody has their own Mr. Big at one point or another: the person you keep letting in even though it hurts, even though you swore you were done. Instead of shrouding that notion in big trap beats and a tortured rap coo (see: Ariana Grande’s “everytime”), Perry jokes about online stalking and offers up her most impressively tongue-tied chorus to date. She makes bad decisions sound enticing.",articles4,"['Katy Perry', 'Thank', 'Zedd', 'Mr. Big', 'Ariana Grande']"

"Every month, Philip Sherburne listens to a whole lot of mixes so that you only have to listen to the very best ones. This edition features heavyweight rave from Minimal Violence and Cera Khin, post-punk dance from DEBONAIR, and fleet-footed bass music from Darwin. Plus: cameos from Dr. Dre and Sheck Wes!“I connect to sound more when it’s sneaky and creeps up on you,” the London DJ DEBONAIR (aka Debi Ghose) has said, and her Resident Advisor podcast is nothing if not surreptitious. From its first minutes, it’s clear that strange forces are afoot: A man’s ASMR-inducing whisper initiates a guided meditation; an eerie, sing-song loop promises “another day.” DEBONAIR snakes her way through slowed-down rave edits and nimble ambient dub, and she doesn’t drop a four-to-the-floor pulse until 30 minutes in; even then, the mix remains streaked with industrial accents. Just when you’d expect it to peak, it slows down not once but twice, then gathers steam for a rattling noise-techno climax before collapsing in a heap. Shriekback’s 1982 funk-punk classic “All Lined Up” makes for a canny ending, its blend of dance and doom perfectly summing up the set.Where DEBONAIR’s mix bears trace elements of 1980s gloom, Vancouver’s Minimal Violence go full bore on coldwave dread and industrial shudder. The first half of the set skulks through slow-motion synth pop, gothic acid, and EBM; the second half is more in keeping with the pummeling doom techno of the Vancouver duo’s debut album, . Tzusing’s “Cubicle” threatens to overload the speakers with bass-heavy throb and disorienting shouts; Le Dom’s “Oazis” builds a high-tech bridge from Sheffield’s sooty past to a shiny electro future; Notausgang’s “Vegancore” is straight-up bludgeoning. After Ikonika’s grimy “Bodied (OG Mix),” Vancouver darkwave duo Koban’s “This Pursuit” comes out of nowhere to finish things off, a finale made all the more blindsiding for its manic, double-time pulse.New York’s Beta Librae has an unusual style behind the decks, unpredictable yet carefully controlled. Her excellent recent mix for Tim Sweeney’s Beats in Space show slipped across brittle techno, disco house, and decade-old 2-step throwbacks; the only similarity in this set for Chile’s Fake Rolex series is its expansive range, along with her skill at keeping the tempo in flux. It’s an enveloping session, moving from ambient and slow-motion breaks into fractured bass music and linear, driving techno. The final 15 minutes are particularly striking, as rolling breakbeat techno gradually speeds up and turns to atmospheric drum’n’bass, which in turn dissolves into ambient dub, all without breaking a step. It’s a serpentine voyage across points unknown.Last September, Joy O cooked up a surprisingly slinky mixtape for the Japanese streetwear brand Cav Empt; now Ploy, a fellow fringe bass music acolyte, does the same—and, like Joy O, he’s generously popped the audio on SoundCloud, for the benefit of all of us who aren’t Tokyo hypebeasts. A sample of Dr. Dre’s “Still D.R.E.” kicks off the mix in unexpected fashion; the first half hour is a slow, almost imperceptibly accelerating tour of dubbed-out machine snares and menacing, percussive bass music. Roughly halfway through, the synthetic flutes of Ellll’s “Pepsi” add a rare moment of relative clarity; then Ploy dives back into the murk with a handful of crisp, cutting electro tunes—Amish Boy’s “Laika Test Project,” Konrad Wehrmeister’s “Kitchen Blade,” and Phoenicia’s 1999 classic “Odd Job (Soul Oddity Rhythm Box Version)”—that keep the atmosphere from getting too oppressive.Berlin’s Machine Woman has a fitting name. Her music does sound unusually mechanical, grinding and buzzing; her DJ mixes unroll like a rusty assembly line dripping blackened grease and spitting sparks. This short but potent set hits all those notes, its lurching rhythms topped with dry, scratchy synths, and unsteady 4/4 grooves giving way to occasional stretches of understated turmoil. There’s a great moment early on where the beat gives way to the terrifying sirens of Peder Mannerfelt’s “Acid Drop”; a few minutes later, the bottom drops out, revealing a dark, cavernous netherworld. Recorded in the main room of Tbilisi, Georgia’s hallowed Bassiani, it’s all the more exciting for having taken place in an actual nightclub—precisely the type of setting where energy like this is most welcome.Amsterdam’s Dekmantel festival is known for its eminent taste. Their lineups curate only the best Detroit techno, classic house, cratediggers’ disco, etc. They are a lot of things, but they don’t often sound like the gleefully apocalyptic circus rave that Cera Khin has pulled together in her podcast for them. The Tunisian-born, Berlin-based DJ’s set is pure party, as giddy as a 16-year-old necking a pill at their first Glastonbury. Acid squiggle, ghetto-house vocals, gabber kicks, hardstyle shuffle, rave stabs galore—it’s rude, pummeling, and, with BPMs around 150 or so, makes for an excellent aerobic workout as you gallivant around your apartment cutting shapes. What makes it all work is that there’s not a shred of irony here; Cera Khin takes music often lampooned for its cartoonishness and makes it sound properly intense. I have not heard a more flat-out entertaining mix this year.Berlin’s Darwin, who’s behind the REEF parties at the city’s Griessmühle club, turns in a sleek, storming bass-music mix for R&S Records. She kicks off with a string of punchy, UK garage-influenced cuts, all bruising basslines and precarious swing, then fakes sideways into electro and house—dropping, at one point, what almost sounds like an acid remix of 1994 Autechre—and then progressively leans into the tempo fader. The breakbeats speed up, moving from rough cut and nostalgic to laboratory-precise; she ends on a pair of flickering, ethereal footwork tracks—including Teklife associate DJ Phil’s stunning “Rok N Down,” a remix of Chicago house icon Adonis’ “We’re Rockin’ Down the House”—that perfectly sums up the set’s opposing poles of moody and body-moving.BandCloud—the Irish curator Aidan Hanratty’s weekly roundup of independent music from Bandcamp and SoundCloud—recently made a big step forward with , a charity compilation of new, exclusive tracks from leftfield electronic artists like Yamaneko, Cruel Diagonals, and Violet. (The latter is a frequent subject of this column whose star is definitely on the rise.) Now the London DJ Peach, of NTS Radio, delivers a seamless mix of all 15 songs. It’s no easy task to take a selection this diverse and make something coherent of it, but Peach manages to make it all hang together wonderfully. The opening ruminates on downbeat house and murky ambient; the final third turns more intense, with Yakui’s manic “Airycloud” blending into the slow/fast psychedelia of CCL and Flora FM’s coiled “Winding Plod,” a highlight of the comp. The middle part of the mix is a passage of house and techno as deep as anyone could want; the blend between Persuasion’s dubby “Aidan’s Dream” and Doc Sleep’s Detroit-inspired “Three Suns,” about 30 minutes in, is a total chef’s-kiss moment.Bilbao’s RRUCCULLA makes some seriously demented electronic music.  demented, too: a giddy mix of drill’n’bass (propelled by her own live drumming), deconstructed club techniques, and -grade post-genre ooze. In advance of her live performance at this year’s Sónar festival, she whips up a dazzling 34-minute set that blends reworked bits from her 2018 album  with scraps of jazz, anime, classical minimalism, and even a snippet of Sheck Wes’ “Mo Bamba,” which gurgles away as though stuck inside a flooded airlock. Like everything she does, it’s exhilarating, entertaining, and leaves the mind reeling.",articles4,"['Philip Sherburne', 'Dr. Dre', 'Debi Ghose', 'Sheffield’s', 'Tim Sweeney’s Beats', 'Ploy', 'Dr. Dre', 'Konrad Wehrmeister', 'Phoenicia’s', 'Peder Mannerfelt', 'Cera Khin', 'DJ’s', 'Teklife', 'Yamaneko', 'Peach', 'Yakui’s', 'Persuasion', 'Doc Sleep’s']"

"Listen to the track belowRosalía’s latest single may be a tongue-in-cheek ode to high fashion that name-checks Valentino and the Hamptons, yet the intentional misspelling of  betrays a mocking tone. The accompanying video for “Aute Cuture” features the Spanish singer and a team of baddies—the sisters of ”The Beauty Gang”—flexing a gaudy aesthetic that resembles  meeting the Yeehaw Agenda, asking for “hands in the air if you’ve ever been ripped off.” It’s a campy take on swag, one that seeks to revere high heels, fringe, leopard print, and six-inch nails like custom fits from luxury fashion houses.With a booming bass beat laced with synthetic hand claps and horns from frequent collaborator El Guincho, “Aute Cuture” hits hard from the jump and is over as quickly as it began, clocking in at just under 2:30. The one-off single feels distinct from the breathtaking statement that was 2018’s , and a natural follow-up to her J Balvin collaboration “Con Altura” distinctly aimed at the club. And as she follows her Colombian collaborator’s lead and veers further into a more pan-Caribbean sound, much of Rosalía’s recent output may benefit from a reminder that she’s not actually “Latin,” but European. On a pop hybrid like “Aute Cuture,” Rosalía draws as much influence from Latin trap, reggaeton, and electro R&B as she does flamenco and her fusion of Latin America’s modern pop rhythms with the sounds of Spain’s Gitanos. It’s that style—and the grace with which she blends these disparate sounds together—that’s made her one of the most exciting voices in music the world over.",articles4,"['Valentino', 'The Beauty', 'Rosalía’s']"

"Listen to the track belowA new Burial song got a surprise debut on Mary Anne Hobbs’ BBC Radio 6 show this week, although the title, “Claustro,” is hardly surprising at all. The British bass musician’s output has often channeled the dank, mildewed air of caskets, cobwebbed passageways, and other dark confined spaces. But titles can be deceiving: “Claustro” turns out to be kind of a banger.It’s been nearly two years since Burial’s last solo releases: In late 2017, he enjoyed an unusually productive spell, putting out three 12""s in just a few months’ time, each one subtly expanding the boundaries of his sound. “Subtemple” and “Beachfires” were pure ambient; “Rodent” was a brooding, heads-down house groover; and “Pre Dawn”/”Indoors,” for Boddika’s Nonplus imprint, were cavernous rave anthems as big as anything he’d ever done. With “Claustro,” he returns to the UK garage that has always been fundamental to his sound. The rimshot-heavy beat shuffles and swings like it’s 1999 all over again, and the way he chops up the vocals has the unmistakable air of the 2-step bootlegs of R&B hits that once ruled the UK’s dancefloors. It’s slathered in all the vinyl hiss and moody sound effects we’ve come to expect from Burial, but despite the murk, the whole thing just , with overlapping vocal hooks, buried MC shouts, and errant rave stabs contributing to the forward motion.There is one bona fide surprise built into the song: A false ending, five minutes in—a fadeout, a sampled radio shout-out (“This song goes out to that boy”), and then the breakbeat kicks in again, only just a hair faster, paired with a campy Euro-dance bassline. “I’ve got my eye on you/Tonight I’ve got my eye on you,” goes the hook, over a perky synth riff; anyone listening to Hobbs’ show might have wondered if she’d thrown on a new record, but for the omnipresent wax crackle, a sure sign that we were still listening to Burial. You don’t hear a lot about Burial’s sense of humor, but the outro to “Claustro” suggests that he might not be nearly as serious as people often assume—and that, after all these years crafting one of the most recognizable sounds around, he’s still got a few tricks up his sleeve.here at the 1:10:40 mark",articles4,"['Burial’s', 'Burial’s']"

"Nigeria is notorious for its email scammers—known as “Yahoo boys”—and it’s a reputation the government is eager to shed. Last December, the country’s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) announced a crackdown specifically on young men suspected of internet fraud. “We have declared a total war on Yahoo boys, who have done nothing but give Nigeria a bad name at home and abroad,” one government operative told the Lagos-based newspaper . So far, “Operation Cyber Storm” has reportedly led to more than 150 arrests.This ongoing debate over Yahoo boys collided with the Nigerian music world in early April, when the popular singer Simi told her 4.4 million Instagram followers that internet fraud was wrong, and that Yahoo boys shouldn’t listen to her songs or watch her videos. Not long after, Afrobeats star Naira Marley offered a different take. On April 19, the UK-based, Nigerian-born singer/rapper wrote in an Instagram post, “If u know about slavery u go know say yahoo no b crime [sic].” Facing backlash, Marley elaborated in an Instagram live session several days later. He urged Nigerians to “pray for internet fraudsters” rather than condemn them, and argued that Yahoo boys pump money into the economy: “Where the fuck do you think it’s coming from? You think it’s coming from the government?” This prompted some Nigerian social media users to call for an EFCC investigation into Marley’s ties to Yahoo boys.On May 9, Marley capitalized on the controversy by releasing “Am I a Yahoo Boy,” featuring the massive Nigerian rapper Zlatan. The upbeat song and its accompanying video playfully respond to Simi, at one point outright stating that Marley is not a Yahoo boy but he does have a Yahoo email address (which is how the scammers got their name in the first place). Marley even says, in Yoruba, “They want to treat me like they treated Fela.” It’s a heavy but still timely comparison. Fela Kuti, Nigeria’s most famous musician and an outspoken government critic, was jailed in the ’80s for 18 months—on what Amnesty International called sham currency smuggling charges—by the same military leader who today is the country’s elected president.The day after “Am I a Yahoo Boy” dropped online, the EFCC announced that it had arrested Marley (real name: Afeez Fashola), Zlatan (Omoniyi Temidayo Raphael), and three others for their alleged connection to online fraud. Zlatan and the three others (about whom little information has been reported)—Tiamiu Abdulrahman Kayode, Adewunmi Adeyanju Moses, and Abubakar Musa—were released five days later on “administrative bail.” EFCC spokesperson Tony Orilade confirmed their release to Pitchfork but said an investigation into the four was “ongoing.” In a separate statement, Orilade told reporters that Marley was not released due to “overwhelming evidence” against him.On May 16, the EFCC revealed its charges against Marley. According to a Lagos Federal High Court complaint provided to Pitchfork, Marley twice “conspired” to use others’ credit card numbers, had at least three credit cards that weren’t his own, and possessed five allegedly counterfeit cards “with the intent to defraud.” The 11 counts carry a potential sentence of seven years in jail if Marley is found guilty. He appeared in court on Monday, May 20, pleading not guilty. He released a new song, called simply “Why” and accompanied by an image of him in handcuffs, on May 30. Later that day, he was granted bail, and the trial was set to begin on October 22.“Naira Marley does not practice fraud, neither does he facilitate it,” reads a statement attributed to Marley’s management. “He’s being used as the poster boy for fraud… Naira did not publicly [defend] those who commit fraud, he expressed his view on the situation, which was simply his opinion.” According to the statement, Nigeria’s government was trying to prosecute Marley “based on a cheeky song” and on unspecified “items” found on a laptop that Marley, a UK resident since the age of 11, had borrowed so he could record and upload music and videos while visiting his native Nigeria.

          On May 19, Zlatan, who still has not been charged, released a new single, “4 Nights in Ekohtiebo.” The title plays off the name of the street where the EFCC is headquartered. The lyrics are mainly sung in Yoruba, reportedly including a line that translates to: “My people know me, forget the fact that they tried to give me a bad name.”Marley’s team has not responded to Pitchfork’s requests for further comment. A representative for Zlatan said Zlatan was not yet ready to talk. And Orilade, the EFCC spokesperson, has not answered when pressed by Pitchfork on the nature of the government’s evidence against the two rappers. Ibrahim Magu, acting chairman of the EFCC, said in a public event last week that the agency was not targeting musicians, according to . Magu said that “the EFCC does not go after an innocent person.”When the EFCC originally arrested Marley, Zlatan, and the others, the sole evidence cited by the agency was unspecified “intelligence reports.” But the EFCC said that during the arrest it “found and recovered a number of items, including laptops, from the suspects.” The detainees, the government said at the time, “have so far volunteered useful information about their involvement in the alleged criminal activities, even as investigations continue.” The EFCC has not elaborated on what that information has been.Marley’s management, in its statement, argued that the MC was in jail not for cyber crimes but for his lyrics and comments—in other words, the basic human right to free speech. The whole thing vaguely recalls the way that rappers’ lyrics have been used against them in U.S. courts as evidence of their misdeeds, instead of what they really are: creative expression. “As an artist, music is Naira’s avenue of expressing himself,” reads the statement. “He is not a ‘Yahoo Boy!’”",articles4,"['EFCC', 'Lagos', 'Instagram', 'Yahoo', 'Yahoo', 'EFCC', 'Zlatan', 'EFCC', 'Zlatan', 'Zlatan', 'EFCC', 'EFCC', 'Zlatan', 'EFCC', 'Zlatan', 'Zlatan', 'EFCC', 'EFCC', 'EFCC', 'Zlatan', 'The EFCC', 'Marley’s', 'Naira’s']"

"The plaza in front of MACBA, Barcelona’s museum of contemporary art, is normally a riot of kinetic energy. Skaters have colonized the long, black cement ramp leading up to the museum’s entrance, and to approach the building is to be immersed in a web of sound produced by all those moving bodies: the clatter and whizz of wheels on pavement, the grinding of decks against stone blocks, the grunts of athletic effort. But on a recent Friday, the space in front of the white, glass-sheathed façade was quiet save for the steady patter of rain. It made for a fitting prelude to a new exhibition devoted to Christian Marclay, a multimedia artist whose work is intimately connected to the role of sound in everyday life—even when the art itself is silent.Long before his 24-hour video collage The Clock began drawing crowds around the world—the novelist Zadie Smith called it “sublime, maybe the greatest film you have ever seen”—Marclay made his name with an iconoclastic approach to recorded music that turned the art world on its ear. Simultaneously a DJ, collage artist, and sculptor, Marclay has fused classic album covers into fanciful new formations, glued broken vinyl records into Frankenstein-like discs, and fashioned outlandish objects like a Moebius strip woven together from cassette tapes or a pair of glass drumsticks. , on view at MACBA now through September 24, makes for a provocative look at how Marclay represents sound visually. With two of Europe’s premiere music festivals, Primavera Sound and Sónar, taking place in Barcelona over the next two months, the exhibition is well timed: Its mix of collage, photography, and video makes for a fine palate cleanser for festival attendees’ weary ears.The first thing you see upon entering the exhibition is an enormous, floor-to-ceiling blackboard covered with musical staves. This is , on which museumgoers are invited to scribble in chalk, with the attendant markings eventually to be interpreted by visiting musicians. Several performances of ’s ephemeral score will take place throughout the show’s run, and after each one the chalkboard will be erased, the “composition” of the piece started from scratch.Looking at  the day I visit, there’s lots of tourist graffiti and inspirational slogans (“#LOVE YOURSELF,” complete with hashtag). Some music fan has written “YUNG BEEF <3,” in reference to a popular Barcelona trap rapper. But other attendees have chalked in chords and melodic fragments along the staves, and inside a set of parentheses, someone has even written: “An interlude where the whole orchestra pretends to be chickens.” The piece seems underwhelming at first, a symptom of the museum world’s pivot toward Instagram-friendly spectacle, but it  sneaks up on you in unexpected ways. Walking into the next room, I realize that I have the melody to “Let It Be” in my head, activated by notes that have been carefully plotted on the stave, accompanied by the lyrics of the chorus. It gets me thinking about music as virus, music as secret code, music as an expression of the collective unconscious. is not the exhibition’s only encounter with music in the wild. I particularly like , a set of photographs of musical notation that Marclay has found in public spaces: a roll of “Top Note” toilet paper, the wrapper complete with treble clef; scales embroidered across the back of a man’s cowboy shirt; a bass clef tattooed on someone’s forearm. Similar in form and spirit is , a slide show of onomatopoeia spotted in public spaces, which, like , is also meant to serve as a musical score. Images flash across the screen: There’s a can of Fizz blueberry cider, a print shop called Snap, a clothing store called Splash. Across the strap of a man’s baseball cap, a single word: “BUZZ.” As in much of Marclay’s work, a subtle sense of humor runs through it, like a pedal tone. The fact that none of the performances of these pieces I later find online sound anything like what I hear in my head only deepen their gnomic pull.A still from Marclay’s  (2002).One of the most rewarding pieces in the show is , an important predecessor to . The 13-minute loop collages together 700 clips—Jack Nicholson at the piano in , Lori Singer practicing cello in her socks in , the famous “Dueling Banjos” scene from —to create a kind of audiovisual DJ mix. What seems at first haphazard reveals, on subsequent viewings, hidden rhythms and accidental rhymes. There’s a masterful passage toward the end, triggered by a lone gunshot, where the shower curtain is ripped off the rod in , a ball bounces across a spinning roulette wheel, and a phonograph needle clicks against the runout groove. It’s the quietest moment of the whole piece, and one of the few to foreground sound effects rather than music. It feels especially illuminating in the context of the exhibition, in which raw sound stands on equal footing with anything an instrument might produce.The bulk of the show is given over to Marclay’s recent comic-book pieces, based on the onomatopoeic sound effects that will be familiar to anyone who has ever so much as glanced at the Sunday funnies. One of the benefits of a show like  is the way it reveals Marclay’s obsessive tendencies: Once he gets hold of an idea, he keeps worrying away at it, as though trying to decode some hidden mystery. Here, seeing those all those exaggerated starbursts rendered so many ways—modest newsprint collages, oversized jabs at action painting, the disorienting video installation —you get the sense that he’s listening for something, some kind of collective audiovisual language. As my eyes roamed over this cornucopia of  and  and , my brain couldn’t help but “hear” them.Then a funny thing happened: In the echo of those imaginary sounds, the silence of the museum opened up around me. Rather, not silence at all, but all the sounds that had overtaken it. An alarm beeped steadily from behind a gallery door; a phone across the room, possibly the guard’s, chirped once and fell silent; the air conditioning hummed away. Was that the patter of rain on the roof high above, or was I imagining it? Were my sneakers always this noisy when I shifted my weight? I felt a little like I had stumbled into a performance of John Cage’s , the famously “silent” composition in which the incidental sounds of the concert hall are the piece itself. I’d never been a big fan of Marclay’s comic-book pieces, but suddenly, they made sense. Like all of his work, they’re a way of looking at the act of hearing, and they take delight in the sparks that fly from the collision of the two senses.Stepping back out into the plaza, the rain had stopped, but the skaters were nowhere to be found. My sneakers squeaked across the wet pavement and I felt—to borrow a phrase from Cage—like my ears were now in excellent condition.",articles4,"['Barcelona’s', 'Europe’s', 'Splash', 'Jack Nicholson', 'John Cage', 'Cage']"

"Listen to the track belowIn January, Sleater-Kinney posted a photo that broke the internet for a second time. Yes, the riot grrrl pioneers were back in the studio working on a follow-up to 2015’s , a thrilling announcement in itself. But then there was Annie Clark, aka St. Vincent, front and center, sitting in the producer’s chair taking up all the space. The endless possibilities of what this collaboration might sound like remain a bit mystifying, but the first taste is a clear knockout.On “Hurry on Home,” Sleater-Kinney cut the bullshit. The table has been set, the rooms have been cleared, space has been made, there’s no excuse to not come over and fuck. “You know I’m dress down-able, uptown-able, hair grab-able, grand slam-able,” Carrie Brownstein teases, showing off how malleable she can be. She digs into her flaws further, declaring herself “unfuckable, unlovable, unlistenable, unwatchable” with an almost gleeful self-vitriol. She reels these descriptions off like an announcer at a beauty pageant—insecurities have never been such a turn-on. The relentlessness of her desire is mirrored by Brownstein and Corin Tucker’s gigantic, thick guitar riffs and Janet Weiss’ bull’s eye drumming. A metallic synth floats through the background of this tension alongside a squall of grunts, squawks, and sighs. When Brownstein bellows, “You got me used to loving you” at the end of the song, her desperation shoots skyward with a manic energy. After this confession, as the song snaps to a searing finish, Brownstein can be heard gasping for breath in the sudden absence of sound: sincerity can be exhausting.",articles4,['Yes']

"Listen to the track belowWe live in particularly trying times for optimism, but here is Sufjan Stevens, shaking things up and teaching us to love again. “With My Whole Heart” is his self-described attempt to “write an upbeat and sincere love song without conflict, anxiety, or self-deprecation.” Coming from a guy whose every passing interest—U.S. state history, Tonya Harding, fucking Christmastime—seems to result in teary-eyed contemplation, it’s a noble pursuit. Inevitably, he almost falls apart less than two minutes in. “I confess the world’s a mess,” he admits softly, “but I will always love you.” You can almost sense him gazing out the window wistfully before remembering the task at hand.Even more surprising than the lyrical shift, however, is the music: five minutes of unabashed and (relatively) unadorned inspirational soft rock. On 2010’s , Stevens embellished these types of simple pop melodies with queasy, complex arrangements that made it sound like the songs were spontaneously combusting beneath a heap of sputtering machinery. Now, he lays it bare, daring you to hold eye contact. There are rolling toms, glittery keys, call-and-response choruses, and a legit guitar solo to close things out. Love is a familiar subject, he reminds us, but it can also be radiant.Packaged with the similarly glowing “Love Yourself,” “With My Whole Heart” continues Stevens’ method of post-Carrie & Lowell transmissions: conceptual, out-of-the-blue, and released for a good cause. These new tracks arrive in anticipation of Pride Month and the sales benefit charities for LGBTQ+ and homeless youth. In this context, the positive message feels especially close to his heart. Along with the new songs, Stevens shared a 1996 demo of “Love Yourself” that’s shorter, starker, and less certain of its message. Like a lot of his work from this early period, it feels fragmented and vulnerable and alone: a small thought whispered into a quiet room. Here, he gives it a community.",articles4,"['Sufjan Stevens', 'Carrie & Lowell']"

"To make an Elton John biopic is to make a spectacle, so naturally  begins with a dramatic entrance. The singer, played by  star Taron Egerton, walks down a hallway donned in a bejeweled orange devil costume, complete with enormous feathered wings and heart-shaped sunglasses. Set to “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” it’s that classic slow-mo strut before the grand finale concert, except—plot twist—it’s not. Instead he tornadoes his way into an AA meeting, sticking out like a sunburnt thumb with a curious horned growth.It’s the late 1980s, and Elton John has hit rock bottom. As he tells the small group gathered in the dingy room, he’s addicted to cocaine, alcohol, sex, and high-end shopping—a serious slate of problems that’s played for laughs in this gag of an opening. John, who served as an executive producer on the film, seems to want to show a sense of humor about the tragedies of his past. Still, it’s uncomfortable when the joke is set up to make the audience laugh at how ridiculous he looks, mid-crisis. It’s also the first of many times that  abandons standard biopic structure in favor of surreal sequences. This is a fantasy as much as a biography. Distasteful opening aside, the film is improved by its absurdity. was helmed by Dexter Fletcher, the uncredited co-director (ghost director?) of the wildly successful, multiple-Oscar-winning embarrassment of a movie, , which also took factual liberties. The difference is that the Queen biopic was more explicitly packaged as the truth, whereas  clearly demands suspension of belief from the viewer. When audience members magically start floating while witnessing John’s debut performance at the Troubadour in L.A., it  like an accurate depiction of stumbling upon once-in-a-lifetime talent. The film’s numerous musical montages are inherently corny, but hearing John’s countless hits—even reworked as inferior covers—is a moving, crowd-pleasing experience. It almost makes you wonder why more musician biopics aren’t actual musicals.Aesthetically,  is an extension of ’s pastiche of ’70s sepia tones, and that’s a shame, because it feels so dreary for a personality that was anything but. But it is also better than  in almost every way: the editing, a leading role that plays to Egerton’s strengths (rather than burying him in caricaturish chompers, a la Rami Malek), and the handling of the protagonist’s queerness. The film’s inclusion of a gay sex scene, between the singer and his boyfriend-turned-manager John Reid, feels refreshing for such a big studio picture, even though it quickly cuts to black (we’ll see how this one gets censored in other countries). Unlike poor Freddie in , Elton isn’t pitied or blamed for his gay lifestyle, and despite a tumultuous falling-out, his homosexuality isn’t used as a weapon of his demise. Ultimately, we know this isn’t a tragic ending.John has said that he was proud to get the gay sex scene into a major studio movie; it’s clear this was something he put his foot down on. But his involvement also tips  into slight vanity project territory. While the emotional anchor of the film is his relationship with longtime friend and lyricist Bernie Taupin (Jamie Bell), the songwriting process seems to come to John in an almost supernatural manner. Even as a kid, then known as Reginald Dwight, John is able to immediately emulate songs on the piano. We get it, Elton John is a musical genius.The film’s greatest downfall is letting John’s personal grudges color the characterization of its antagonists: the indifferent, insensitive mother (Bryce Dallas Howard) who tells her son, “You’ll never be loved properly”; the even more indifferent absentee father (Steven Mackintosh), who lives on with a new family and seemingly no regrets; and worst of all, John Reid. Funnily enough, Reid was also Queen’s manager and is depicted in  (by Aidan Gillen; here he is played by fellow “Game of Thrones” star Richard Madden). He’s portrayed as much more of a villain to John, who had his heart ripped out in what was his first significant gay relationship. This works its way into an un-nuanced portrayal of Reid, shown openly cheating on Elton in his own home, bragging about manipulating him for money, and encouraging the singer’s substance abuse. Though some of those details certainly could be true, Reid and John had a more harmonious long-term professional relationship than is portrayed by the film’s timeline. They stopped working together in 1998, when John became suspicious that he was being overcharged and took Reid’s company to court. The irony is, Reid has maintained all these years that he tried to curb John’s irresponsible spending.Though  grows exhausting by the end, the fact that it never dips too low along the way is a testament to its unconventional approach. Family drama is worked out through a rendition of “I Want Love,” and a suicide attempt turns into an emergency room dance number. The song-and-dance routines are the saving grace of an otherwise trite movie. Even when it closes with an on-the-nose rendition of “I’m Still Standing,” you can’t help but feel a twinge of triumph.

"“I’m going to go away for awhile,” Moby writes, following a controversy regarding a passage in his memoir about PortmanMoby has canceled the UK and Ireland leg of his book tour, the BBC reports. According to a note on Moby’s website, he “is canceling all upcoming public appearances for the foreseeable future.” Tickets will be refunded, according to the note. On Instagram, Moby added, “I’m going to go away for awhile.” Find Moby’s planned tour dates below.Moby’s book tour was in support of his new memoir Then It Fell Apart, which has been met with controversy due, in large part, to a passage about Natalie Portman. In the book, Moby claims that Portman asked him to “meet up” after a show in 1999 when he was 33 years old and she was 20. (Portman was actually 18 years old.) “I was a bald binge drinker and Natalie Portman was a beautiful movie star,” he wrote. “But here she was in my dressing room, flirting with me.”In an interview with Ella Alexander for Harper’s Bazaar, Portman said, “I was surprised to hear that he characterised the very short time that I knew him as dating because my recollection is a much older man being creepy with me when I just had graduated high school.” She added, “He said I was 20; I definitely wasn’t. I was a teenager. I had just turned 18.”In addition, Portman explained, “When we met after the show, he said, ‘let’s be friends.’ He was on tour and I was working, shooting a film, so we only hung out a handful of times before I realised that this was an older man who was interested in me in a way that felt inappropriate.”Following Portman’s comments, Moby posted a shirtless photo of himself with his arm around Portman. He has since deleted the Instagram post and apologized to Portman. “I accept that given the dynamic of our almost 14 year age difference I absolutely should’ve acted more responsibly and respectfully when Natalie and I first met almost 20 years ago,” he wrote.In his May 28 note, he added, “I am the one who released the book without showing it to the people I wrote about. I’m the one who posted defensively and arrogantly. I’m the one who behaved inconsiderately and disrespectfully, both in 2019 and in 1999. There is obviously no one else to blame but me.”

"Listen to the track belowSex is like a spinal tap. At least, that’s the simile that Crumb’s principal songwriter Lila Ramani casually throws out at one point in “Fall Down,” her lilt filtered as if singing to her lover through an apartment intercom. On the latest single from the Brooklyn-via-Boston psych-pop quartet’s upcoming album , Ramani paints a twinkling portrait of intimacy in the dead of summer: “I can’t take the heat when it’s busy on the street/When I need it like a fix, let me in, I’ll be quick.”Having cut their teeth playing in soul and hip-hop bands during their time as college kids in Boston, Crumb effortlessly capture the mood of Ramani’s musings—sensual but playful, anchored by drummer Jonathan Gilad’s consistent backbeat. At the apex, Ramani steps away from the mic to deliver a feedback-laden guitar freakout that evolves into a solo, echoing her own melody lines. Then the comedown hits; the instruments fall limp, keyboardist Brian Aronow’s chromatic lead line rotates back into the spotlight, and Ramani gets somber. “You make it easy to feel no pain/When you are above me, bathe in the rain,” she murmurs. When the world is on fire, the right person can make it all better.",articles4,"['Crumb’s', 'I’ll', 'Ramani’s', 'Jonathan Gilad']"
"Court files obtained by Pitchfork outline competing allegations of physical violence, threats, and harassmentFor the past six years, a messy dispute has been ongoing between Foxygen’s Sam France and his ex-girlfriend Elizabeth le Fey, a former touring member of the band who also makes music under the name Globelamp. The tumultuous relationship between France and le Fey has been documented by both parties in courtrooms, in the press, and on social media, with each accusing the other of abuse. Pitchfork has obtained the public court files in each case, which outline competing allegations of physical violence, threats, and harassment. The accusations range from alleged punches in the face to claims of cyberstalking and a “murder plot.”Recently, the conflict picked up again in the Los Angeles county courts. In 2014, France was granted a five-year domestic violence prevention restraining order against le Fey. It was renewed this March. Le Fey is currently seeking the same against France, and was recently granted a temporary restraining order in the meantime.Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for France, who did not comment about the matter on the record prior to deadline.The relationship between the two musicians began in 2012 after le Fey appeared in the video for “San Francisco,” a song from Foxygen’s 2013 breakout album . She joined the band’s touring lineup shortly thereafter as a backup singer and multi-instrumentalist, and went on the road with them in 2012 and early 2013. For a time in 2013, le Fey and France lived together in Olympia, Washington. In July 2013, le Fey wrote a Tumblr post detailing alleged drama within the band, prompting an online backlash complete with disparaging comparisons to Yoko Ono. By the end of October 2013, France and le Fey had parted ways, and both moved back in with their parents in Southern California.On January 2, 2014, Sam France filed for a domestic violence prevention restraining order against le Fey in Van Nuys Courthouse East in Los Angeles. Le Fey did not retain legal counsel, and represented herself. France was granted the restraining order, which restricted le Fey from coming near him and four of his family members for five years. According to court documents, the court denied France’s request for an order that le Fey not post “any reference” to him on the internet, citing freedom of speech.Le Fey, in published interviews and on social media, has long denied allegations that she did anything worthy of a restraining order, repeatedly maintaining that France was the abusive person in their relationship. “The restraining order that was issued five years ago should never have been issued,” le Fey’s lawyer, Dan Kapelovitz, told Pitchfork in an emailed statement on May 8. “We believe that Mr. France sought this restraining order not because he is actually in fear of any physical harm, but rather he wants to silence Ms. Gomez from speaking out about their relationship and his physical assault on her.” (Le Fey’s legal name is Elizabeth Gomez.)In his restraining order request, France alleged that an incident of physical abuse took place on October 16, 2013, when he and le Fey were living together in his house in Olympia. “Our fighting had gotten to a point that I feared for my life,” court documents filed by France read. “She entered my house while I was asleep, jumped on me, strangled me, and punched me. She threw one of my canes at me, missing my head.” (He was recovering from a broken leg at the time.)France also claimed that le Fey went to his parents’ Los Angeles home twice without permission and opened the door. In his written statement, he claims that on one occasion, she told him over the phone, “I’m going to throw a fucking rock throught [sic] that window,” and, “If your mother blocks me I am going to fucking tase her in the face.”France also alleged multiple instances of “online threats and harassment,” including snooping through his email accounts, threatening to post a video of him naked, and threatening to share private information. “Because I am a public figure in a popular band, she has been using this information to publically [sic] humiliate me and damage my career,” he wrote in his restraining order request. He also accused le Fey of slandering his bandmates with the July 2013 Tumblr post.In a December 22, 2013, Facebook message, le Fey allegedly wrote, “I wish I never met any of you and I regret replying to your email and being in your yuppie music video,” according to court documents filed by France. “Just wait and See [sic] how it all unfolds ha ha hahahahah.”Foxygen (with le Fey) perform a Take Away Show in 2013On December 12, 2018, as the five-year deadline on the restraining order neared, France filed in Van Nuys Courthouse East to renew it. He claimed that le Fey continued to “verbally assault” him and “threaten physical harm” to him online, according to court documents. At a hearing on March 19, 2019, a judge granted his request, and the restraining order was renewed for five years.Nine days later, on March 28, le Fey filed for her own five-year domestic violence prevention restraining order against France in Stanley Mosk Courthouse in Los Angeles.  Le Fey alleged that in the summer of 2013, when they were living together in Olympia, France “hit me in the face” and “blood began gushing from my mouth,” court documents filed by le Fey read.Le Fey claimed that a transcript of their January 2014 hearing showed France “admitting to hitting me,” according to the court documents. In that transcript, obtained by Pitchfork, France is asked by a judge if he “ever attacked [le Fey] physically.” France testified, “Once.” He referred to an incident in roughly July 2013 when they were living together in Olympia. “I was asleep,” the testimony reads. “We were both in bed. She woke me up by getting in my face and saying something about how I’m a bad boyfriend or something about her ex-boyfriend or something like that, and out of being startled, I went like that toward her.” The judge responded, “Showing a motion of your hand swiping away from you?” “Right,” France replied. “And she was right beside me because we were both laying down in bed and being startled I accidentally hit her lip and that’s the incident.” He denied otherwise ever hitting her, kicking her, or threatening her with physical violence of any type.Le Fey also recounted an alleged incident that took place in October 2013. “Samuel’s mother came to visit him. He didn’t invite me and I felt hurt,” the restraining order request filed by le Fey reads. “I told him his mom was rude and only cared about his band making money. He FREAKED out, jumped on me on the bed, and pinned me down. He put his arms around my neck and threatened to kill me… He said if I didn’t ‘shut the fuck up!’ he would stab me with a knife he had. I just RAN out of the house.”Le Fey claimed in court documents that France “used intimidation to try & keep me quiet about his abuse.” She claimed that he “cyber stalked” her “constantly” and posted “lies” about her—allegedly using multiple online accounts—that caused her to be “attacked nonstop” over the internet and “even get death threats,” according to her restraining order request. “I have NO interest in seeing him ever again,” the court documents read. “I am still deathly afraid of him.”Le Fey’s most recent claim was that on June 10, 2018, France “used his official band Twitter to tweet to his thousands of fans that [le Fey] physically abused him daily, raped him, & [has] a murder plot against him,” according to the court documents, which included a screenshot of said tweet. (It has since been deleted.) She denied the accusations.The court granted le Fey a temporary restraining order against France until the case is resolved. The next hearing is scheduled for June 6.The National Domestic Violence Hotline

and he and Kirin recorded 2 songs we’d been working on. Mac has really
dialed his rig and his signal chain is incredibly tasteful. It was
interesting to hear ourselves in a foreign sonic atmosphere, because
we didn’t bring any of our own gear. Also the songs weren’t really
fleshed out at all, and it was great to have their insights and energy
injected into the process of finishing them. They’re a dream team to
be the studio with. Basically a lot of time fucking around, hunting
for tones and vibes that felt cool, sanding down the stones into
something more well kempt. We wound up doing a few takes of each song,
and then everyone had to leave town the next day. Then we sent it off
to the great Ben Baptie to mix & master. Initially, “The Eternal Tao”
was born out of some chord and melody ideas Julian brought to the band
a few months ago, and everyone put their own input and flavor spins on
it and it became its own twisted LSD tinged Nigerian Disneyland of
sorts.The Voidz:05-29 Brooklyn, NY - Market Hotel

"Over the past month, Bixler-Zavala has hinted that the two have been quietly working togetherIt appears that the Mars Volta are coming back. In response to a fan who tweeted “I dream of you guys giving TMV a new chapter,” Cedric Bixler-Zavala wrote, “It’s happening.” It’s not much in the way of confirmation, but as Consequence of Sound points out, a pair of Bixler-Zavala tweets from earlier this month hint that he and Omar Rodríguez-López have been working in the studio. “We are in the kitchen finding new ways to through [sic] curve balls,” he told another fan.In a follow-up tweet, Bixler-Zavala shed more light on the project:What it’s  NOT going to be is your ‘fav member lineup’ playing their
‘classic records’ in full etc. Maybe we’ll play old shit, who knows
how we feel. Just remember our past campaigns never relied on playing
requests or going fully backwards ...it’s new shit, new people, left
turns , tangent inconsistencies, mazapan dreams and churro wishes. I
will say this though, when ORL played me a grip of new shit I fucking
cried. Like Claire Daines in Romeo & Juliet cried. Yeah it was fucking
weird. It’s in its infancy right now. No deadlines, no ball tripping,
no drama, just 2 grown ass men using essential oils and bold new
perfumes shooting ideas  and scooting their ass across the fucking
lawn trying to get rid of these worms.Bixler-Zavala also promised that the band’s back catalogue will get high quality releases and knocked Universal for putting out “fucking buffoon shit” a couple years ago.The Mars Volta’s last album was 2012’s .

"A summary of everything Kanye talks about on the Netflix series “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction”Kanye West’s episode of David Letterman’s interviews series “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman” hits Netflix on May 31. In the episode, West sits down with Letterman for a conversation that opens light (family, his early career), gets more serious (mental health, his feud with Drake), and ends contentious (Trump, #MeToo). Here’s a rundown of every topic Kanye and Dave cover across the hourlong episode, which you can watch here on Friday.His dream of a future where his grandkids can literally float: “Because it’s so unprogrammed and so pure. It’s like, ‘Look, granddad, I can actually float!’”His diet and weight: Dave opened by asking Kanye about his breakfast that morning (fried eggs), how many meals he has in a day (three), and his weight (“about 20 over what I want to weigh”).The songs he sings to his kids at bedtime: “I just freestyle,” he said. “But North is already in her, ‘Don’t sing that dad!’”His relationship with his father: Kanye talked about reconnecting with his father and seeing his “genetic programming” through his actions. “My mom talked about moments where my dad ran onstage and grabbed microphones and did what he felt was right,” Kanye said.The death of his mother: “It was a piece of my story. I wonder sometimes, when I heard about Michael Jordan’s father dying and at the point that happened in his career and the way it parallels to the point it happened in my career. You say the universe has no accidents, and you want to ask God why this happened, and you get into this place of acceptance with it.”Going from producer to rapper: “I had the confidence, this delusional confidence, to think I could rap as good as JAY-Z—even to the point of not playing him beats and saving them for myself. People think I’m crazy now, they thought I was crazy . ‘You ain’t finna play ‘Jesus Walks’ for JAY-Z?’ I was like, ‘Nah, I’ll stash this one.’”His recent beef with Drake: After prefacing an anecdote by referencing “an artist which I will not mention because I’m not allowed to mention him or any of his family members,” Dave interrupted Kanye to call that description “fairly provocative.” Kanye explained, “Well, we had a little beef last year.” He then quoted a favorite line from “Crew Love.”Lyrics that fans don’t agree with: Kanye said that when he tells his own story in a song, masses of fans relate to it. “But then people also latch onto that, and if you switch anything to the story of what you’re supposed to do, then you get this backlash. ‘No, you’re my avatar, you cannot say , you cannot think .’” He continued, “I have a friend who told me my power is my influence, and I said, ‘My power is the ability to  be influenced.’” Dave responded, “Wow, this is pretty good.”His home: Kanye gave Dave a tour of his home, and showed off pieces by the artist Ueda. “You’re familiar with the cultural pursuit of  in Japan,” Dave asked. Kanye responded, “This is what this house is— vibes.”Letterman’s fashion: After Dave described his style as “Howard Hughes in the desert old coot,” Kanye replied, “That’s a vibe.” Then, Kanye started dressing Dave in Yeezy clothes.Andy Kaufman’s influence: After talking about how he views the world from a very literal place in lieu of irony, Kanye started discussing Andy Kaufman’s stint as a wrestler. Dave, stunned, asked Kanye to discuss how Kaufman influenced him. “He gave me courage,” Kanye said. “How do you deal with the media? Here’s an example—I’d far rather be an Andy Kaufman than the majority of the way the media push them around. I’m in front of the joke. The joke is on everyone else.”Hermés’ influence: He called his new fashion line “the Hermés of sportswear.”Zippers versus Velcro: Dave asked Kanye, “If Velcro had been invented first, would there be zippers?” Kanye pauses, and said, “It’s really a deep question for me because we’ve spent a lot of time inventing something past the zipper.”The quote on the cover of ye and being bipolar: Dave asked about the “I hate being bi-polar, it’s awesome” quote, which Kanye said he first saw in an Instagram post. Kanye also explained the experience of “ramping up”—the sensation where, he said, you could end up being hospitalized and “start acting erratic, as TMZ would put it.” He continued, “When you ramp up, it expresses your personality more. You can become almost adolescent in your expression or border into places.”Wanting to change the mental health care system: After saying he sees psychiatrists in his own home, he discussed what it’s like to be “hyper-paranoid” and then taken to a hospital. “You feel everyone wants to kill you, you pretty much don’t trust everyone, and they have this moment where they handcuff you, they drug you, they put you on the bed, and they separate you from everyone you know,” he said. “That’s something that I’m so happy I experienced myself so I can start by changing that moment. When you are in that state, you have to have someone you trust. It is cruel and primitive to do that.”Being misconstrued and written off as “crazy”: “They love to write you off. They love to cut your sentences off halfway. What you say doesn’t mean as much. Sometimes I think it’s a form of protection for me, because if I’m peeping something that people don’t want me to think about or know or say out loud as a celebrity, ‘Oh he’s just crazy.’ And then I go home. If they didn’t think I was crazy, it may be a problem.”Discrimination against people with mental health issues: “This is a sprained brain, like having a sprained ankle” Kanye said, pointing to his head. “And if someone has a sprained ankle, you’re not gonna push on him more. With us, once our brain gets to a point of spraining, people do everything to make it worse. They do everything possible. They got us to that point, and then they do everything to make it worse.”Medication: After saying that he’s been off medication for eight months, there was a light bit of applause in the audience. Kanye then addressed the people who applauded. “When people are schizophrenic and they have deeper forms of that, it’s people who can’t function without medication. So I’m not advocating—I’m telling you my specific story.” Dave asked Kanye if he worried about the creative process suffering because of medication. “Oh yeah,” Kanye said. “That’s just the reality. You know, if you guys want these crazy ideas, these crazy stages, this crazy music, and this crazy way of thinking, there’s a chance it might come from a crazy person.” Dave retorted that he also resisted taking medication for years because of that same fear, but later, he said taking the pills “was like getting a new pair of glasses.”“I Thought About Killing You”: Dave called the song “menacing.” Kanye replied, “It’s a train of thought, but what’s cool is that it’s legal to have the train of thought. Think it all the way through. Don’t  it.” Kanye said he wanted it to be the first song on the album, coming off his infamous TMZ appearance, as a show of “bravery.”#MeToo: Kanye talked about the fear held by men in powerful positions following the #MeToo movement. “We as a society are constantly in fear,” Kanye said. Dave responded, “Well you mention a general fear of the male side of this situation. I would submit that it’s not equal by any equation to the fear women feel being the other side of that.” The crowd then cheered.“I’m definitely supportive of the women,” Kanye said. “What I’m saying is we’re not allowed to have any conversation. When you go to court, both sides can talk. This is a court of public opinion where when someone bombs first, the war is supposedly over.” Dave responded, “These lessons are learned slowly, and that may be the way it’s perceived now, but with future reinforcement and enlightenment, there may be a more reasonable expression of friendliness between the sexes that isn’t threatening to women.”Donald Trump: “I got people that I work with—black, female, all different types of people—that love Trump, voted for Trump, scared for life to tell anyone,” Kanye said. Dave asked, “Did you vote for Trump,” and the rapper responded, “I’ve never voted in my life.” Dave replied, “Then you don’t have a say in this!” The crowd applauded as Kanye said, “You got me!” He continued, “But who says who has a say? Obviously I had a say when I said what I said.” Kanye then discussed his outrage that the 13th Amendment still exists “post-LeBron James, post-Obama.” He then called out the audience for “not clapping to that one.” And then they clapped.Trump supporters: Dave discussed the attempt at voter suppression in the 2018 elections. “If I see a person I admire talking about how Donald Trump can think whatever he does, I wonder if those thoughts, indirectly, aren’t hurting people who are already being hurt,” Dave said. Kanye retorted by asking how Dave feels about Trump voters being treated as “enemies of America” because of their opinions. Dave responded that he understands the good faith logic of electing a businessman who promises to run the country like a business, but thinks that those people are being hurt because of that decision.“Liberals bully”: “Have you ever been beat up in your high school for wearing the wrong hat,” Kanye asked Dave. Dave responded by joking that he was beat up because people didn’t like him. “The idea is the bullying,” Kanye said. “Well, definitely liberals bully people who are Trump supporters. It’s not just calm. You can’t just go and wear the hat. It’s like, ‘Fuck you! Fuck you!’ It’s like bro, I have.

He also discussed how the lighting was inspired by James Turrell and how the music is devoid of programmed drums.

"The lives of celebrity athletes are a rich wellspring for comedy and tragedy alike: the merciless brevity of their time in the spotlight, the irrelevance of their skill set in other aspects of life, the humiliating side effects of success. In mockumentaries for HBO over the last five years, Andy Samberg has parodied the smug elegance of tennis championships () and the insanity of professional cycling (), both to excellent if slightly puzzling effect. There are some similarities between athletes and comedians—namely, that it’s hard to know where to go next. Comedians can demand to be taken seriously—as an actor, a writer, a seen-it-all purveyor of hard truths—but many of them fade away once their moment has passed. As for musical comedians, well, no one wants to hear three middle-aged dudes screaming about their dicks set to the sound of late-2000s hip-hop beats.Despite this, Samberg and his pals in the Lonely Island (Akiva Schaffer, Jorma Taccone) have shown real staying power. It helps that they’ve stayed active behind the scenes, with production credits on recent shows like “Pen15” and “I Think You Should Leave With Tim Robinson.” When they do re-emerge as a group, their material is often faced with the very question of relevance. Their last major work was the 2016 feature film Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping, a mockumentary about the sad trajectory of a boy band member gone solo (played by Samberg). That the movie was a box office flop—albeit one with a growing cult audience—just makes its punchlines land even harder. “How come I’m not having a moment?” Samberg asked in a pivotal scene. “You’ve had tons of moments,” his manager responds, as if knowing how far he’s fallen makes the crash landing any better.In a new 30-minute Netflix special titled The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience, the trio continues their line of questioning, in the form of a fictional rap album made by late-’80s baseball stars Jose Canseco (Samberg) and Mark McGwire (Schaffer). It plays like an absurd cautionary tale on stardom, merging the non-sequitur charm of Samberg’s HBO specials with the big budget splash of . Mimicking the scope of cinematic visual albums like Beyoncé’s Lemonade, the “visual poem” is rife with the players’ interior monologues: “What do we ask of our heroes?” “What is the price of fame?” “Where will we hide from the sun when all the trees are dead?” Interspersed within songs about bench pressing women and partying in an IHOP parking lot, the joke is often found in the pathetic silences they receive from everyone around them. No one cares what you think, the story seems to go, as long as the hits keep coming.Speaking of hits, the songs themselves are punchy and lighthearted and well-suited to a low-stakes surprise drop such as this. We’re almost a decade removed from Incredibad and , the Lonely Island albums that featured honest-to-god charting singles (“I Just Had Sex,” “I’m on a Boat”) and timely collaborations with big stars. Nowadays, the group keeps a smaller circle. Samberg and Schaffer take the lead on pretty much all of the songs, lending only a devilish funk anthem about male objectification to the sisters of Haim (“IHOP Parking Lot”) and a soaring hook about loungewear to Sia (“Oakland Nights”). As with , whose soundtrack seemed to be inspired by a brainstorming session for the worst ideas possible for pop singles, the tight focus keeps things cohesive and fun. Turns from Jenny Slate, Maya Rudolph, and Sterling K. Brown only add to the sense that everyone involved is having a blast.The members of the Lonely Island met in junior high in Berkley, California, during the time when McGwire and Canseco—both Oakland A’s players—were inescapable pop culture figures. While their portrayal is filled with loving nods and references to the late ’80s and early ’90s, the trio seems more interested in using the players as archetypes than providing any sort of nostalgic exploration. You don’t need to be familiar with, or even care about, any particular team to follow the story; its metaphors are as instant and universal as, say, “Jizz in My Pants.” “Where is the limit? There are no limits,” they shout in the pump-up anthem “Focused AF.” “And what is the goal? ”As with most of the Lonely Island’s material, it’s best not to dig too deep. Do the dad jokes need to return as an entire song about avoiding therapy? Probably not. Could the story use a slightly more elaborate arc to foreground all the jokes about ball shrinkage and unrequited horniness? Almost definitely. And after a final verse that’s literally comprised of puns about the names of various baseball teams, the film doesn’t so much end as sputter out in exhaustion—the elusive moment when riffing turns into sighing and checking the time. The whole thing is ridiculous and kind of shameless and unsure how to move on, and that’s exactly the point. “I can’t stop laughing. Loved it,” the real Jose Canseco responded—publicly and almost immediately—in a tweet. “If you want to do a follow up video, contact my manager Morgan: 7023743735.”",articles4,"['Comedians', 'Jorma Taccone', 'Tim Robinson', 'Samberg’s', 'Haim', 'McGwire', 'Canseco']"

"“This happens to a lot of black entertainers not just me either!! I felt crazy being put out by these white men for no reason!”Meek Mill has said that he was denied entry to the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas and threatened by the venue’s security guards with arrest for “trespassing.” On Instagram, Meek said the venue was “going to extreme racist levels” with its alleged actions.Speaking on the phone with Pitchfork, Meek Mill’s attorney Joe Tacopina said that Meek had gone to the Cosmopolitan hotel/casino earlier tonight (May 25) to attend a Mustard concert. Upon his arrival, however, Meek was met by the hotel’s security who told him that he would be subject to arrest for trespassing were he to step out of his car, Tacopina claimed.Meek Mill shared footage of the alleged incident on his Instagram. The video shows the rapper speaking with two men who appear to be security guards for the Cosmopolitan. Meek asks, “How can you tell me I’m going to be locked up for trespassing?”“So here’s the deal, right,” one of the men replies, “we’re a private property; at this time, with the information we have, we’re refusing to do business with you. We have the right to do that.”Meek responds, “But what information?” Later, he says, “You’re not refusing to do business with me; you’re telling me I’ll be arrested if I don’t leave.”The same man tells Meek Mill, “No, no, what we said was... we officially trespassed you.”TMZ shared additional video of the alleged encounter. In TMZ’s video, the other of the two men tells Meek Mill, “If you do not leave these premises immediately, you will be subject to arrest for a misdemeanor.” He also said, “Your subsequent return to these premises after being duly warned not to, will subject you to arrest for trespassing.”Following the alleged events, Joe Tacopina wrote a letter to Anthony Pearl, general counsel and chief compliance officer for the Cosmopolitan. In the letter (obtained by Pitchfork), Tacopina wrote:Mr. Pearl,Please be advised the our firm represents performing artist Robert Williams, known professionally as Meek Mill. It has come to our attention that your hotel, through its security personnel, brazenly denied access to Mr. Williams without just cause. In fact, the incident of his exclusion was captured on  a recording. And, evidenced thereby, despite inquiring as to the reason for his denied access, Mr. Williams was afforded no explanation whatsoever.  Simply put, your security chief embarrassingly did not even know the reason for Mr. William’s denied entry.Your hotel’s failure to provide a reason for singling our Mr. Williams is incredibly telling. In short, we have learned that the Cosmopolitan  maintains a list of African American recording artists who should be denied access for no other reason than their culture and skin color. Such course of conduct constitutes discrimination per se, in violation of state and federal law, and exposes you to significant monetary damages.In light of the foregoing, we urge you to promptly issue an apology to Mr. Williams and grant him immediate access. In the event you fail to heed this one and only warning, we intend to pursue all legal recourse against you.When reached for comment, representatives for the Cosmopolitan wrote to Pitchfork: “As a matter of company policy, we do not comment on legal matters. Our guests’ safety and security always remains our top priority.” In a subsequent statement sent to Pitchfork on May 27, representatives for the Cosmopolitan wrote:“At The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, the safety and security of our
guests is our top priority. The recent situation regarding Meek Mill
related to a matter of security, not race, and any reports citing
otherwise are false. We pride ourselves on providing an inclusive
environment, with zero tolerance for discrimination. Under different
circumstances, Meek Mill would be welcomed to the resort, but not at
the compromise of his personal safety and the safety of our guests.”Update (05/31 5:34 p.m. ET): The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas has issued an official apology to Meek Mill regarding the incident, according to a report by TMZ. “We apologize to Meek Mill for how we handled the situation on Saturday, May 25, as we did not act in a respectful manner and were wrong,” representatives for the Cosmopolitan wrote.  They added, “Meek Mill has not had any prior incident on our property. The Cosmopolitan has zero tolerance for discrimination and we pride ourselves on providing an inclusive environment. We look forward to welcoming Meek Mill back to the resort.”TMZ subsequently reported that Meek has accepted the Cosmopolitan’s apology, according to a statement from Meek’s lawyer Joe Tacopina. Tacopina reportedly told TMZ: “We appreciate the Cosmopolitan’s apology and will no longer pursue legal recourse at this time.”

"Listen to the track belowThe “Nice Guys” finally get a win when Ed Sheeran, a massive pop star still masquerading as an everyman, and Chance the Rapper, a power-tripper masquerading as a holy man, team up for “Cross Me.” Both Sheeran and Chance have made careers out of being the sweetest men in the room. They present themselves as loveable scamps, and that niceness hasn’t gone unnoticed, scoring Sheeran BuzzFeed lists about being the nicest person in show business and getting Chance dubbed the best human of Chicago. Which sets the stage for “Cross Me,” a song that is obviously respectful and appropriately gentlemanly. They’re joined here by the not-so-nice Philly crooner PnB Rock, who just released a record called  yet phones it in hard on this, his biggest opportunity to prove it. This unlikely grouping is sponsored by Sheeran’s upcoming collaborations album, aptly titled . “Cross Me” is inoffensive quiet storm pop. It should be hate-proof. Yet the song is so cloying it’s hard not to be cynical about it.Sheeran, Chance, and PnB Rock each stand ready to defend their lady’s honor, you see. It’s unclear what they’re defending her from and why, but they are ready and willing. Produced by Fred Gibson, who has worked with afrobeats stars like Burna Boy and Mr. Eazi and UK-based rappers like Octavian and Stefflon Don, there’s a bit of throwback R&B sway in this overt pop confection. It’s as if they were trying to work their way up to something like “Sexual Healing” and gave up halfway through. The song is significantly less catchy than the vaguely Caribbean Justin Bieber tag-teamer “I Don’t Care,” which Gibson co-produced with Max Martin. Chance is rapping like he’s doing voiceover work for Adult Swim, or like he’s doing a really mean KYLE impersonation. It’s like watching Stefan Urquelle turn back into Steve Urkel. Sheeran, for his part, is the least awkward-sounding person in this situation, perhaps owed to all the practice being noble.

"Taron Egerton can’t seem to shake “Your Song.” The 1970 Elton John ballad has followed the 29-year-old Welsh actor throughout his career, starting at 17 when he chose to sing it for his audition to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. He took on the tune again about a decade later, as a soulful gorilla named Johnny in the 2016 animated musical . And now it really becomes his song: In the Elton John biopic , out May 31, Egerton sings it right then and there as the man himself—no overdubbing required.Egerton credits his vocal abilities to Wales’ rich choral tradition and his long-held appreciation for music. He’s clearly an Elton fan, but when he calls from L.A. one recent afternoon, he’s keen to talk about his musical past from the days before “Your Song” ruled his world: his mom giving him her vinyl and turning him onto David Bowie, his dad introducing him to soul greats like the Four Tops and Otis Redding. Through a bit of a cold, Egerton chats enthusiastically about his cherished old favorites and new finds.I met Anderson .Paak the other night at the Met Gala. I’m a huge fan of his. I’ve been listening to  a lot lately. There’s two songs that come together in the album called “6 Summers” and “Saviers Road,” and they’re my two favorites. Something I like about him is that there’s a sense of humor in his music. I went to see him perform [in London] with some friends not long ago, and he has this incredibly authentic voice and a really distinctive personality. Also, I don’t know how you sing and play the drums at the same time—it blows my mind. I love singing along to things when I listen. I would not do it in public to hip-hop, being a white Welshman, but I do love it.At some point in my teens, I picked up Nick Drake on my own, realized that he was a genius, and have been obsessed with him since. My mother was playing him for a long time before that. When I was a kid, I found it to be heavy and dark. But as you get a little bit older, you find a catharsis in those things. You begin to understand the complexity of the human experience a little more. My favorite is Pink Moon, the one he wrote just before he killed himself. It’s very odd and it’s not terribly well produced. But I really hear something extraordinary in it—a sort of lost soul. He’s been slightly fetishized as a tragic figure, I don’t want to be a part of that. But his music makes me feel a great deal.I was given Hunky Dory by my mother when I was very young. I’ve always found that record to be very enchanting. There’s a song called “Kooks” that Bowie wrote shortly after the birth of his son Duncan Jones. He’s talking about his fears as a father and whether he’ll be any good at it. One of the lyrics is, “Don’t pick fights with the bullies or the cads, because I'm not much cop at punching other people's dads.” That really made me laugh. Then he also said, “And if the homework brings you down, then we’ll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown.” I always found that to be a really warming lyric, but it’s also got a sense of humor. My mother and I really bonded over it. It was just the two of us living together for the most part, until my teens when she met my stepfather. And I love that record to this day.David Bowie’s always been one of my heroes. I have quite a lot of Bowie memorabilia. I have a signed  [print] by Terry O'Neill. I also found this wicked thing in an old antique shop, a  poster from the late ’60s that says, “Inside The Secret Life of David Bowie.” It’s the coolest thing. I spent about £350 on it, and it sits above my bed. I always feel a bit like he’s watching over me. I never knew him and it’s a silly thing to think, but I find something very comforting about his presence in my home.",articles4,"['Taron Egerton', 'I’m', 'Nick Drake', 'Duncan Jones', 'David Bowie', 'David Bowie']"

"In 1997, Stones manager Allen Klein famously negotiated all publishing royalties away from Ashcroft, who sampled a cover of the Stones’ “The Last Time” on the Verve mega-hitThe Verve’s best-known song, “Bitter Sweet Symphony,” famously samples an orchestral cover of the Rolling Stones’ 1965 song “The Last Time.” The portion sampled was written by arranger David Whitaker. It is not part of the Stones’ original song. But while the Verve cleared the rights to sample the orchestral recording, they did not get the publishing rights from the Stones.In the late ’90s, longtime Stones manager and music industry figure Allen Klein, whose company ABKCO Records owned the copyright to “The Last Time,” subsequently sued frontman Richard Ashcroft, resulting in Mick Jagger and Keith Richards receiving songwriting credit and 100% of the songwriting royalties from “Bitter Sweet Symphony.”Now, according to a press release from Ashcroft’s camp, Jagger and Richards have agreed to unconditionally give their songwriting credits and publishing rights for “Bitter Sweet Symphony” to Ashcroft. The decision comes on the heels of Ashcroft’s management making a direct plea to the Stones members, according to the release.A full statement from Ashcroft reads:It gives me great pleasure to announce as of last month Mick Jagger

Sweet Symphony. This remarkable and life affirming turn of events was

"Nostalgia is not a common theme to encounter in Bill Callahan’s songs. When he has returned to childhood, he’s written with no-bullshit precision (“It was the first part of my life/Second is the rest”) or the kind of broad-strokes analysis more common to describing weather patterns (“I used to be darker/Then I got lighter/Then I got dark again”). But on “The Ballad of the Hulk,” a charming standout from his new double-LP , the past comes into view in clearer, humbler ways. “I’ve been looking back,” he confesses in a sort of prologue. “Well, I’m just talking about the old days.”To be more specific, he’s talking about “The Incredible Hulk”—the late-’70s television series starring Bill Bixby. The specificity may seem jarring at first; you’ll definitely want to roll the tape back to hear Callahan drawl in a bemused aside, “That’s the Hulk.” But as he burrows deeper into his memory, the metaphor intensifies with the depth and humor of his best songs. The music around him—a breezy, homemade twist on the epics from his last few records—speeds and settles as his perspective changes. In his unmistakable baritone, he considers the way his emotions affect the world around him; he wonders if he’s made mistakes, if his diet needs changing, if all his introspection is getting annoying. There’s a new, adult tenderness to his delivery. “After this next song we’ll be moving along/Out of this vein,” he announces quietly at the beginning. These aren’t questions that can be answered all at once, so he just lets them hang and wanders on.",articles4,"['Bill Callahan’s', 'I’m']"

"Eliot Curtis was dosed with acid while fixing a vintage Buchla Model 100Eliot Curtis, the Broadcast Operations Manager for KPIX Television, was recently tasked with the restoration of a vintage Buchla Model 100 modular synthesizer—an instrument that had been sitting in a cool, dark room at Cal State University East Bay since the 1960s. During Curtis’ repairs, which he tended to from his home, something strange happened: He began to trip out.... It was as if he was high on LSD.He was. According to a report by San Francisco KPIX 5, Curtis opened a red-paneled module on the Buchla, at which point he saw “a crust or a crystalline residue on it.” Curtis reportedly sprayed a cleaning solvent on the area and attempted to dislodge the crystal with his finger. After 45 minutes, Curtis was overcome with a strange tingling sensation, followed by a nine-hour trip, the report states.The substance found on the instrument was later tested and identified as LSD, according to KPIX 5. An anonymous LSD researcher and expert later confirmed to KPIX 5 that the drug can remain potent for decades if stored in a cool, dark place, and that it is possible to ingest LSD through the skin.The instrument’s inventor—the late Don Buchla of Berkeley—was heavily enmeshed in 1960s counterculture; in 1966, his synthesizers found their way onto a school bus purchased by acid advocate Ken Kesey and his followers. Buchla was also a friend of Owsley Stanley, the Grateful Dead’s sound engineer, and manufacturer of a highly potent strain of LSD. Despite the connections between Buchla and acid, however, no one is sure exactly how LSD ended up on the Buchla Model 100 at Cal State, KPIX 5 reports.Since Curtis’ trip, the vintage Buchla has been thoroughly cleaned of all LSD.

"In 2016, a band called Sioux Falls released , an ambitious, 72-minute double album debut that sounded somewhere in between Pavement and early Modest Mouse.

The Portland quartet’s latest single, “Leona,” possibly their peppiest cut yet, reverts back to those ’90s influences. The “ba-da-da-da”s in the chorus wouldn’t sound out of place beside “Semi-Charmed Life” on a playlist.“Leona” taps into alt-rock nostalgia without becoming hokey. Frontman Isaac Eiger is caught between a budding relationship and the mundanity of adult responsibilities: “I can still taste your kisses/Never want to do my dishes.” But the future feels a lot more real now that he’s encountered someone worth sticking it out for. “I've given up wanting love/But I could count the ways I've wanted you/I can't believe you'd want me too,” he sings, and a rush of entranced guitars lead the song out.

"Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper’s A Star Is Born remake was responsible for more than just a career reboot and Gaga-sized quantities of memes. Also born: enough new movies about fictional bands to fill a festival. Perhaps you’ve heard of , where Elisabeth Moss plays against type as a Courtney Love figure who doesn’t move through the scene so much as lash out at every surrounding molecule of space. Or , which charts Natalie Portman’s rise to -ish outsider diva. Or , about a small-town Polish girl (Elle Fanning) who takes her love of Robyn and No Doubt to an “Idol”-esque TV show. Even the much-maligned but nevertheless much-awarded Bohemian Rhapsody might be considered fictional in a way, considering how they portrayed Freddie Mercury.It’s easy to see why these kinds of films appeal to studios. In an age when movie ideas are judged for their franchise potential from the get-go, films about bands provide a ready-made secondary income stream: the soundtracks, the potential live performances, the fanbases of whoever’s tapped to write the music. Even video games like “League of Legends” are launching band spinoffs. The rise, fall, and rising again of an act also provides a ready-made story arc, while the excesses of the music industry make for potent fodder along the way.But the best music movies are about something more potent: that elemental force that arises when musicians come together in the same room and give themselves over completely to the sound. There are a number of beloved classics in this vein, but we thought we’d highlight a few lesser-seen films about fictional bands.A showcase for avant-garde musician Hazel O’Connor, whose soundtrack of the same name went Top 10 in the UK,  is the closest of the movies here to the standard rise-and-fall story arc. But it’s no redemption arc, instead a musical tragedy along the lines of , plus some fascist undercurrents that play a lot differently in 2019 than 1980. The usual music industry crud builds and builds: payola, censorship (one producer suggests editing a lyric’s swear words to “punch him in the nose! nose! ”), harassment, controlling managers turned romantic partners. And its heroine eventually succumbs on stage to all this accumulated mental poison.But the film has a trick. Much as  rewrites history so that Sia’s music is the sound of 1999, a year when Sia was barely out of jazz club trenches,  assigns Bowie levels of fame to its too-spiky-for-the-business protagonist, Kate, all extreme closeups and desperate drive. Combined with the soundtrack by O’Connor, among the more underrated artists of the new wave era, the story becomes something else: not an artist felled by fame, but an artist misserved by the industry. (You can rent or buy this movie via Amazon or iTunes.)Re-released a few years ago (and recently highlighted by The Ringer), this Australian comedy depicts the music industry at its most gonzo. Like many young dreamers, teenage bartender Jackie and her cousin Angus want to make it big in the music biz—in part because the money might save the family pub. Unlike many young dreamers, however, they go about this by having Jackie walk a tightrope alongside a skyscraper wearing a sequined cape, red granny boots, a harness, and large fake boobs, before throwing fireworks down at the street and staging a dramatic fall. (It doesn’t get less ridiculous in context.)Directed by Gillian Armstrong and designed by  alum Brian Thomson, the ensuing musical is peak farce—a number performed by synchronized swimmers is among the  normal ones. Jo Kennedy brings plenty of screwball slapstick as Jackie: singing and flailing on an ironing board, dangling above a stage in a cupcake dress. And Ross O’Donovan is great as that well-known archetype, the ’80s smirky-kid grifter; his final plan, after some misadventures, involves disguising as backstage crew and dive-bombing a talent show stage. What better way to celebrate our current Summer of Scamming? (You can rent this movie via Amazon.)Directed by Katja von Garnier, best known stateside for ,  follows four musicians who are imprisoned for, among other things, defrauding and/or killing their abusive husbands. They start a band as part of a rehabilitation program, then use it as an opportunity to break out. A label, headed by a cartoonishly coked-up record exec, recognizes the potential publicity supernova in a fugitive rock group (the tagline “, plus !” is suggested at one point) and signs them, but they can’t play a show without the cops showing up.As high concept as  is—there’s a hint of  in there, plus several decades’ worth of prison exploitation films—it doesn’t quite hew to formula. The band’s rise is hampered by the slight complication of being on the lam. The closest thing to a love interest is a hostage the band takes after a show (Calvin Klein underwear model Werner Schreyer, basically in the role of Calvin Klein underwear model), but he is unceremoniously kicked off the bus at the first sign of sexual drama. Instead the movie delves into other, less explored themes: music as a channel for repressed feelings or mental health struggles; band camaraderie that isn’t friendship exactly, but a shared bond of nihilism; and an ending that involves snipers, rooftop leaps, and a beefed-up cover of Saint Etienne’s “Hobart Paving.” (You can buy this movie via Amazon.)The title of  is taken from a single by the Japanese pop-punk band the Blue Hearts, specifically its sudden surging chorus. (Andrew W.K. knows it—he covered the track in 2008.) The song is beloved by a few Japanese students (one played by  and ’s Bae Doona), who start a band called Paranmaum and cover it for their school’s cultural festival, recruiting a Korean exchange student as their vocalist.As much a coming-of-age film as a band movie,  is thoroughly unrushed, spending as much time at rehearsal as it does on the phone with teenage crushes. Present throughout is a sense of sheer glee, whether it’s the girls crate-digging through a box of tapes or just jamming together. One of the students dreams of opening for the Ramones—the perfect band for the movie, really, given their large, welcoming fanbase and the exuberance of their music. It’s that same exuberance that powers Paranmaum’s finale performance, which of course pulverizes. (You can buy this movie via Amazon.)Another film about teenage rockers, this one based on Coco Moodysson’s graphic novel . Like the group in , the band is comprised of a couple of middle school friends, the kind who in a different era (the film is set in the ’80s) might join a Girls Rock Camp but instead recruit another student to round things out. The mousy, extremely Christian classical musician Hedwig has in chops what the other two have in attitude.There’s more of a cavalier current here. The girls are always positioned against men: men in bands, men at school, men in the family, all sneering to some degree. Of all the musicians on this list, Bobo and Klara are the youngest, and they fuel their music with the realest, most visceral kind of teenage rebellion—the kind that’s against pretty much anything that just happened. They change a song about how much oil companies suck to a song about how much parents suck, after one of them barges in on band practice with extreme dad energy and a clarinet.

"A Nightwave track is about energy. Stuttering breakbeats, swaggering kick drums, whiplash snares—the Glasgow producer (aka Maya Medvešek) knows the elements that can make a track move. Her new single “Rainbow Body” has all the kineticism we’re used to from her, but it’s also a showcase for a side of her work that doesn’t come to the fore quite so often: melody. Tipping her hat to Detroit techno’s lush, colorful synths, she lays on layer after layer of soaring, gliding keys, stretching and smearing them until they fill the frame with supersaturated glow. It might take a few spins to realize that, save for some steady, insistent snare rolls, there’s really not much in the way of drums at all here. She doesn’t need them.

"Invisible HitsAs of this writing, it’s unclear whether the Woodstock 50 festival will take place. But either way, you can bet Yasgur’s Farm there’ll be no shortage of boomer-nostalgia-stoking thinkpieces this summer about the legacy of the original Woodstock. Thanks to the subsequent film, live album, and countless mythmaking efforts over the decades, Woodstock is an abiding symbol of late 1960s counterculture, the ultimate expression of the so-called Age of Aquarius. There’s a reason (besides, you know, money) that Rhino is releasing a 38-disc deluxe set presenting every last note recorded the weekend of August 15-18, 1969. But Woodstock was far from the only mega-festival to take place in the summer of ’69—and it was far from the best, perhaps just the best documented. Let’s take a look back at some of the other “tribal gatherings” that took place 50 years ago this summer, via a handful of audio and video artifacts.Jimi Hendrix’s closing set at Woodstock remains one of the era’s defining musical moments—a performance that’s as celebratory as it is incendiary. But he kicked off the summer of ’69 in more downcast fashion. Just a little more than two (wildly productive) years after the Jimi Hendrix Experience burst onto the scene at 1967’s Monterey Pop Festival, the band’s original lineup played its final gig as headliners for the first (and last) Denver Pop Festival in June. Perhaps reflective of the Experience’s inner tensions, the trio’s set is less fiery than usual; it picks up steam, however, on a raging “Red House,” with Hendrix coaxing positively demonic sounds from his guitar, whipping the crowd of 50,000 into a violent frenzy. Even all these years later, it’s not hard to understand why riots broke out immediately after Jimi left the stage. The rest of the weekend was perhaps a little more groovy, with Frank Zappa’s Mothers of Invention bringing their skewed pop to the Mile High City and Big Mama Thornton delivering some old-school flavor.The Newport Jazz Festival had been a summer tradition in Rhode Island for more than a decade, highlighting the best swing, bebop, and big band talents of the day. But in 1969, organizers decided to bring a selection of rock groups onto the lineup, including Led Zeppelin, the Mothers of Invention, and Sly and the Family Stone. Things did not go smoothly. Crowds crashed fences, riots threatened to break out, toilets overflowed. But amid the chaos, some seriously great music was made. Miles Davis tried out his revolutionary electric sound, tearing through a ferocious set that previewed , the landmark effort the trumpeter recorded just a few weeks later. Zeppelin’s heavy blues-rock fusion gave a glimpse of the stadium-ready sound that would dominate the 1970s. And James Brown’s set caught the Godfather of Soul at a career high point, bringing blindingly brilliant funk to Newport’s Sunday afternoon.Led Zeppelin actually pulled double duty over 1969’s Fourth of July weekend, also appearing at the Atlanta International Raceway for the Atlanta Pop Festival. They were joined by such festival regulars as Sweetwater, Delaney & Bonnie, Chicago, and Janis Joplin. Unlike many other similar events, however, there’s not a great deal of evidence of the Atlanta Pop Festival, audio, video, or otherwise. Still, this amateur Super 8 footage gives us an uncanny (if very shaky) glimpse of what it was like to actually be in the audience at one of these late 1960s festivals—pot smoke billowing, sunburns spreading, long-haired hippies dancing. (It’s silent, so you’ll have to provide your own soundtrack.) For more stoned home movies, check out similarly charming footage from the Atlantic City Pop Festival, which took place a few weeks later.Some Woodstock attendees undoubtedly harbored the hope that Bob Dylan would make a surprise appearance at the festival. After all, Dylan lived in the  Woodstock, just a few miles from the Bethel, New York, location. But no, Bob instead chose to cross the Atlantic a few weeks later for his only major festival appearance during this era. The Isle of Wight Festival was the songwriter’s first full concert since 1966—and what a difference three years made. In place of the viciously confrontational Dylan of his ’66 tours, the audience of 150,000 was serenaded by a sweet country crooner. Clad all in white, Dylan led the Band through new ballads like “I Threw It All Away” and bouncy rockers like “Quinn the Eskimo.” He even dipped back into his folkie days for a lovely solo rendition of the timeless traditional number “Wild Mountain Thyme.” (The entire show was finally released in 2013 as part of a  deluxe edition.) Reviews for the hotly anticipated show were mixed, however; Dylan likely seemed a bit out of step with the high-energy antics that festival-goers had come to expect. Any disappointed fans on the Isle of Wight that weekend could comfort themselves with the magisterial rock power of the Who, though.The same weekend as the Isle of Wight, Texas was throwing its own massive festival. Many of the by-now-usual suspects were involved: Led Zeppelin played a much-bootlegged set that’s rightly praised as one of their finest early performances—check out the explosive “Dazed and Confused” for proof. Janis Joplin brought her signature blues wail back to her home state, though the highlight is her achingly sweet rendition of the Bee Gees’ “To Love Somebody.” Sly and the Family Stone’s typically buoyant performance caught the group at one of their ecstatic onstage peaks. The best way to experience the Texas Inter-Pop Festival, however, is via a hazy documentary that cherrypicks some of the best performances and features copious scene-setting audience footage.As captured in renowned documentarian D.A. Pennebaker’s film , the Toronto Rock and Roll Revival assembled a Mount Rushmore of early rock’n’roll heroes. Forget Woodstock’s cringe-worthy pastiche artists Sha Na Na—Jerry Lee Lewis, Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, and Little Richard all deliver lean-and-mean performances that sound positively punky compared to some of their descendants’ increasingly overblown trips. But this festival is probably best remembered for the unannounced closing set from John Lennon and Yoko Ono, accompanied by an all-star (if very under-rehearsed) band featuring Eric Clapton, Alan White, and Klaus Voorman. After the group cruises shakily through a handful of oldies, as well as the Beatles’ own “Yer Blues” and the brand new “Give Peace a Chance,” things take a decidedly left turn. It’s intense. Yoko howls mercilessly while John conjures up excoriating feedback in proto-no wave fashion. The audience was likely bewildered, but Lennon loved it. “The buzz was incredible,” he raved. “I never felt so good in all my life.”",articles4,"['Yasgur’s Farm', 'Woodstock', 'Jimi Hendrix’s', 'Jimi Hendrix Experience', 'Experience’s', 'Hendrix', 'Invention', 'Led Zeppelin', 'Miles Davis', 'Zeppelin’s', 'Led Zeppelin', 'Sweetwater', 'Delaney & Bonnie', 'Janis Joplin', 'Woodstock', 'Led Zeppelin', 'Janis Joplin', 'Family Stone', 'Roll Revival', 'Bo Diddley', 'Chuck Berry', 'Little Richard', 'Yoko Ono', 'Beatles’']"
"There’s a rapper on Spotify named Lil Kambo who’s racked up 2 million streams and counting on his song “Kid Carti.” This would be a significant feat for any unsigned, self-releasing artist in the modern day. The only problem is that “Lil Kambo” doesn’t exist and “Kid Carti” is a pitch-shifted leak of Playboi Carti’s yet-unreleased track “Kid Cudi” (previously referred to as “Pissy Pamper”), a song the rapper’s been teasing for some time and even playing out live. Lil Kambo isn’t a viral hit—he’s a fraudster.This unofficial leak, uploaded to Spotify on April 19, racked enough plays in recent days to top the U.S. Viral 50 chart on Spotify, as Genius pointed out earlier today. A peek around the metadata gives us a couple bits of information: “Kid Carti” is credited on Spotify as being written and performed by Lil Kambo, and it was uploaded to the platform via Distrokid, the digital distribution company in which Spotify owns a minority stake as of last year. The only other songs on Lil Kambo’s profile, “Diamonds Real” and “Made It Back,” are previously leaked Lil Uzi Vert songs.The “Fans Also Like” tab on Lil Kambo’s Spotify profile reveals even more impersonators, two of whom are using a press shot of Playboi Carti with the monikers Unocarti and Unocompac. All of these profiles—which are “verified” by Spotify as of press time—are seemingly operated by the same person behind Lil Kambo. Unocarti and Unocompac’s profiles also feature previously leaked music, much of it distributed via Distrokid. Searching for those artist names on Apple Music reveals similar leaks, also distributed via Distrokid.Fraudulent releases are nothing new on sites like YouTube and SoundCloud. But these recent unauthorized uploads, as demonstrated by the unauthorized Beyoncé and SZA releases back in December and a “Fenty Fantasia” leak of Rihanna songs in March are indicative of a growing trend that’s only grown more apparent in the past several months: leaks or unreleased snippets that make their way to “legitimate” streaming platforms, racking monetized streams by fans eager to consume that content regardless of who owns it or who benefits from the plays. (It’s unclear how services like Spotify, Apple Music, or Distrokid handle payments for fraudulent streams; Spotify has not yet issued comment on the matter.) In this case, the Distrokid user seemingly responsible for the uploads goes by “Unocompac,” and has even gone so far as to link his Twitter and Instagram accounts, where he promotes new leaks. The Instagram account has over 117,000 followers.There’s little doubt that Carti’s record label will issue takedowns to Spotify and Distrokid to remove Lil Kambo and similar leak accounts. (If they don’t, and the leak is allowed to stay up, that would raise further questions. Pitchfork has reached out to representatives for Universal Music Group, Spotify, and Apple Music for comment.)That said, it’s unclear what—if anything—is stopping other would-be fraudsters from following in Unocompac’s tracks. In April, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek told investors that nearly 40,000 tracks are uploaded to the streaming platform every 24 hours. The case of Lil Kambo raises questions as to how many of these uploads might be ripping artists off.Update (05/22 11:18 a.m. Eastern): As of May 22, fraudulent music on the profiles of Lil Kambo, Unocarti, and Unocompac have been removed from Spotify. The artist profile for Unocompac on Apple Music still features leaks, available to listen on the platform.",articles4,"['Playboi Carti’s', 'Spotify', 'Spotify', 'Lil Uzi Vert', 'Spotify', 'Spotify', 'Spotify', 'Instagram', 'Spotify', 'Eastern']"

"After an eventful few years between albums, Tyler, the Creator’s follow-up to 2017’s  is here.  feels naturally like the next block in Tyler’s evolutionary chain. It is warm and often pretty and all about making sense of love. He seems to have taken lessons from his previous albums, including his stint making compositions inspired by a Grinch movie, and applied them all toward this confessional missive.Of course, in Tyler’s eyes, this is its own thing, separate from all of his preceding releases. “Don’t go into this expecting a rap album,” he wrote of  in a long post before its release. “Don’t go into this expecting any album.” So what, exactly, should you expect? Here are five things to listen for on your initial spins of .Beneath the surface, unrequited love is the thread most often carried throughout Tyler’s records, but  is by far his most blunt about it. For much of its 39-minute runtime, Tyler is just trying to get the love he deserves. There is an arc of lost love, from the initial infatuation phase to the manipulation and falling out of love stages, all of which are played out across song titles: “I Think [I’m Falling in Love],” “[I’m Your] Puppet,” “I Don’t Love You Anymore,” and “Are We Still Friends?”Singing is often a vehicle through which rappers convey emotional honesty, so it should come as no surprise that Tyler’s most lovelorn album finds him embracing his vocal range. He bares all to someone who won’t do him the same courtesy. These songs seem to be addressed to the same person, or at least the same kind of person: a lover who can’t reciprocate because they can’t be true to themselves. (“You never lived in your truth, I’m just happy I lived in it/But I finally found peace, so peace,” goes one of the album’s best kiss-offs.) Tyler forgoes a happy ending for something realer: “Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy/But I will never want to fall in love again.”Whereas  was inspired in part by pop structures (particularly Max Martin’s catalog of hits and Pharrell’s work with Justin Timberlake),  is more experimental in form. The traditional rap songcraft of two 16s and a hook is abandoned in favor of something looser. This  a rap album, just a sort of wonky one; his bars are often heavily distorted and pushed into the margins. Really, everything is distorted, including the drums, which bop a bit more. There isn’t a lot of what might be considered dance music in Tyler’s back catalog, but “I Think” and “What’s Good” are clearly among his most grooveable tracks ever. The focus here is on melodies, Tyler’s beloved chords (primarily featured through pianos), and his carefully arranged and warped vocals. Heavily influenced by N.E.R.D., the album sounds a bit like he’s taking a mulligan on .As ’s cover notes, all the songs were written, produced, and arranged by Tyler, but close collaborators help actualize the ambitious undertaking. Many of these voices retreat as quickly as they appear, and without any credited guests they can get lost in the maelstrom of sound. Frequent harmonizer Kali Uchis appears on “IGOR’s Theme,” bending with Tyler’s vocals and masking when they dip out of tune. Friends Frank Ocean and A$AP Rocky sneak onto “Running Out of Time” and “New Magic Wand,” respectively. Mentors Pharrell Williams and Kanye West contribute considerate if not nonessential verses. Santigold has a cameo, Lil Uzi Vert has a writing credit (“IGOR’s Theme”), and Playboi Carti hogs the spotlight on “Earfquake.”Tyler didn’t do much press surrounding , but he did sit down with comic Jerrod Carmichael for an hour-long taped interview. They never dug much deeper than Tyler’s love of chords and the general song-making process, avoiding questions about the emotional tenor and content of the songs. When Carmichael shows up on , it feels like the closing of a loop.

"The disproportionately high rate of mental illness among musicians is well documented, as are pleas for enhanced services. But what’s conspicuously missing from this discourse is any concrete resource about accessing mental health or addiction-related services if you are, in fact, a professional musician. Such services would require the good-faith commitment of quite a bit of money from record labels—something that, until a few months ago, didn’t seem to exist in any formal capacity. An independent Canadian record label is changing that.Toronto’s Royal Mountain Records—the Canadian label home of Mac DeMarco, Alvvays, U.S. Girls, and more—announced in February that they would be offering $1,500 to each individual musician on their roster for mental health and addiction-related services. (The money is a non-recoupable expense, meaning that the artists don’t pay it back.) It’s a humble sum, a fact that Royal Mountain founder Menno Versteeg is quick to admit, but perhaps as important as the material commitment is the precedent it suggests: that record labels, like other businesses, ought to be responsible for taking care of their workers.“I don’t care if other industries pat me on the back, but I do care when artists say to me, ‘This is making my job, my career, so much easier,’” says Versteeg. He’s seated on a second-hand couch in the label’s Toronto headquarters, a two-floor apartment that used to be a makeshift Buddhist temple and now bears the scrappy decor and charming disarray of a gentle anarchist’s college house. It’s not as though Royal Mountain will be cracking the Fortune 500 anytime soon. This was the first year the six-person company could afford any kind of mental health fund, setting aside roughly $100,000 for the members of their 25 active bands.“It comes out of our bottom line,” Versteeg says. “It’s money that would go to the owners or toward paving the driveway. It’s a lot but it’s still just a dent.” While usage of the funds is confidential, Versteeg says he’s already heard from Royal Mountain acts who plan on using it. “I’ll be invoicing, I’ve got some bills,” notes one, Brandon Williams of the post-punk band Chastity, with a chuckle.The ideal endgame, in Versteeg’s mind, is eventually providing comprehensive health insurance for Royal Mountain artists. Few full-time musicians are able to sustain the kind of work that would provide them with health benefits, so many are simply left uninsured. Versteeg thinks that the first step in bridging this gap is reconceptualizing musicians’ roles as workers, as opposed to mere hobbyists. “This  a real job,” Versteeg stresses, “and it’s funny that we have an attitude otherwise in our own heads.”Institutional abuses of creative labor throughout history are the rule rather than the exception, and the music industry has infamously thrived off of creatives while maintaining little, if any, responsibility for their well-being. Versteeg is intimately familiar with these poor working conditions. He’s been touring for the past 20 years, the last 12 of which have been with the Canadian indie rock band Hollerado. His experiences informed the fund’s creation. “Every clichéd touring experience, [including] struggles with addiction, we went through it,” he says, “and we could never afford any shit like therapy. It’s one thing to say, ‘I’m here and I care about you,’ but there’s something to be said about backing that up with resources besides just your time.”If an independent record label can find money in their budget for mental health and addiction-related services, it prompts the question: Why can’t a major label, too? “Uh, capitalism,” responds Linnea Siggelkow of the Royal Mountain dream-rock group Ellis with a laugh. Siggelkow notes that other industries, like digital media, have seen a wave of worker-led unionizing in order to secure better working conditions. Yet musicians’ unions, like SAG-AFTRA and AFM, have failed to capitalize on this trend. “I have no idea why it’s such a foreign thing [in the music industry], especially for major labels,” she says. “It’s crazy that it’s taken this long for something to come up, and that it’s being looked at as so radical.”Royal Mountain and Sub Pop artist Orville Peck echoes this sentiment: “It’s sad that we have to be so excited about this. We shouldn’t be as shocked by it as we are.” Like the other musicians interviewed for this story, Peck finds that there’s a lot of lip service paid to dealing with mental illness and addiction without much tangible support. “A lot of organizations want to say, ‘We need to talk about it, we want to get it out there,’ and it’s like the bare minimum of wokeness,” he adds.Peck says that on his current income, money for therapy is scarce. “It’s not a financial possibility for my mental health to be a priority because I just don’t have the resources,” he adds. “I’m a gay cowboy who wears a mask. There’s already so much difficulty trying to survive as an artist these days.” But the fund has prompted Peck to reinventory his approach to anxiety—“not only to think about it, but to go and sort it out.”Siggelkow was already medicated for anxiety and seeing a therapist, so the funding has lightened her existing load. “Part of the anxiety is the financial stress,” she adds. Though it may seem like common sense, recent studies show that uninsured individuals living on a low income are more likely to suffer from severe mental illness. That same data, based on the U.S.’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health, raised another issue tantamount to this particular story: alcohol dependence is by far the most common substance abuse disorder—and a terrible illness to battle when your workplace is also a bar.Just 16 years old, “Stranger Things” actor Finn Wolfhard and his bandmates in Calpurnia already feel alienated by the industry’s reliance on substance use. “Music and touring life are associated with partying, and if you’re not up to speed, then it feels like you’re not included,” says the Royal Mountain signee. While Wolfhard doesn’t face the financial barriers that young bands seeking mental health services often do, his frustration with corporate awareness campaigns that don’t actually help fix the problem is palpable. “For those who can’t have that opportunity [to get help], it’s time that other people started stepping up,” he says.“It is actually a high-risk lifestyle,” adds Chastity’s Williams of the touring grind. The singer started going to therapy when he was 15 years old and now hosts DIY shows to raise money for mental health nonprofits in Toronto’s Durham Region. He’s hoping to see more shows at safe, inclusive community spaces that accommodate those trying to stay sober. “It’s a wild, bad, old concept—artists playing in bars as often as we do,” he says with a groan. “We get to the venue, and before anyone’s talking about food to us, they’re letting us know the alcohol situation. Give me a break.”Williams is focused on building out Royal Mountain’s approach into broader industry reform. “I’m happy that our label has stood up to represent us, but there’s a lot of big picture movement that needs to happen to make sure that everyone is looked after,” he says.Change is slow coming, but other industry players are focused on solutions, too. Sweden’s Record Union just announced that they’ll be donating $30,000 to initiatives aimed at helping musicians who experience mental illness. Like Royal Mountain’s funding, the sum isn’t huge, but the message behind it is.“At the end of the day,” says Siggelkow, “a small chunk of change can make a huge difference.”",articles4,"['Such', 'U.S. Girls', '“It', 'Brandon Williams', 'Chastity', 'Hollerado', 'Ellis', 'Peck', 'Peck', 'Peck', 'Health', '“It']"

"Listen to the track belowLana Del Rey’s affinity for California is so firmly baked into her music that “Doin’ Time,” her cover of Sublime’s 1996 song for the upcoming documentary about the ska-punk band, seems like it could have appeared on her debut. Adapting Bradley Nowell’s expressive rapping into her own blasé drawl, the track glides on roiling trip-hop percussion similar to the bossa nova version of Gershwin’s “Summertime” sampled in Sublime’s original. But “Doin’ Time” remains decidedly within Del Rey’s wheelhouse, repping Sublime’s hometown of Long Beach with a newly dreamy slant.Coming on the heels of Del Rey’s recent clear-eyed singles, “Doin’ Time” feels especially lightweight, a return to the well-established beachside flavor of “High by the Beach” or her 2012  EP. But Del Rey includes her own unique touch: On the song’s bridge, her voice rises to an airy, youthful tone backed by reedy ad-libs, transmuting Nowell’s “evil woman” tirade into a gender-flipped interpretation that adds a layer of complexity to a song that decidedly has very little. Del Rey’s hazy version of “Doin’ Time” will most likely remain a small treat in her discography, perfect for soundtracking barbecues all summer, but its low calorie count shouldn’t dissuade you from enjoying the song’s simple pleasures.",articles4,"['Del Rey', 'Del Rey', 'Sublime', 'Del Rey', 'Del Rey']"

Could I liberate the other instruments in the band as well for the new show?  It turns out I could.... Because of how theatrical the show is, others started telling me ‘this needs to go to Broadway.’ Why not? But what did that mean?

"Listen to the track below“I always said we would stop before we got bad,” David Berman wrote upon disbanding Silver Jews in 2009. “If I continue to record I might accidentally write the answer song to ‘Shiny Happy People.’” “All My Happiness Is Gone,” the debut single from his new project Purple Mountains and the first new music since his hiatus, stays true to the mission. Don’t let the breezy arrangement or singalong “I Melt With You” chorus fool you: David Berman is as miserable and alone as ever.The initial distribution was defiantly old school—a 12"" vinyl single sold exclusively at indie record shops—and the song itself sounds proudly unfazed by any changes that may have occurred in the past decade. Backed by a humming mellotron and a hazy two-chord acoustic guitar progression, Berman reintroduces himself with a genuine bummer of a verse about the difficulties of maintaining adult friendships. “Lately I’ve been making strangers wherever I go,” he confesses in his queasy, drunken rumble. But then he always came across like someone we hadn’t heard from in years: someone who knows we’re hanging on his every word and still would rather be anywhere else (even if it’s just at the back of the bar, where no one can bother him).A direct evolution from the pared-down fables of Silver Jews’ 2008 swansong , the lyrics favor idiomatic precision in place of the poetic specificity that defined Berman’s early work. He’s still got a knack for unlikely rhymes—“substratum” and “happened,” “hardships” with “yardsticks”—but there’s little here that would sound out of place in an old country standard. On the B-side are two remixes: a hollowed-out calypso rendering and an extended version with spoken word samples between each verse. Berman sounds equally comfortable (or maybe equally uncomfortable) in each setting—proof that no distance, time, or company can strip away our true nature. It’s like he never left.",articles4,"['David Berman', 'Silver Jews', 'Purple Mountains', 'David Berman', 'Berman’s']"

"Gentle Monster claims that it sent $2.5 million to Yusef after he claimed he could get West to contribute to the brand’s campaignThis past February, South Korean eyewear brand Gentle Monster released a video called “13 MUSIC” that purportedly featured a track co-written and co-produced by Kanye West and his collaborator Malik Yusef. After its release, however, Kim Kardashian West tweeted, “Kanye is not involved and did not produce this song.” Gentle Monster subsequently took down “13 MUSIC” and all associated promotion.Today (May 16), Gentle Monster has filed a lawsuit against Malik Yusef and others, The Hollywood Reporter reports and Pitchfork can confirm. In the lawsuit, filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, Gentle Monster claims that “Yusef used his seemingly close relationship with Kanye West to deceive Gentle Monster into believing that he could bring some of the world’s most talented artists together to produce a series of videos designed to increase Gentle Monster’s global brand recognition.”According to the complaint, Yusef did successfully arrange a meeting between Kanye West and Won Lee (Gentle Monster’s U.S. CEO) in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Following the meeting, the suit alleges, Yusef gave Lee a Universal Music Publishing Group song agreement that granted Yusef permission to use a song called “New Angels” for Gentle Monster’s campaign. The agreement appeared to have West’s signature and a copy of his driver’s license, but lawyers for Gentle Monster claim that “Yusef procured this agreement without Kanye’s knowledge or consent.”Along with fraudulently reproducing West’s signature, Gentle Monster says that Malik Yusef claimed he could get Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, Vic Mensa, Michael K. Williams, Jaden Smith, Parison Jackson, Amber Rose, and Rosario Dawson to participate in the campaign. (Vic Mensa and Michael K. Williams did appear in the “13 MUSIC” video.) Gentle Monster claims that it sent Malik Yusef $2.5 million to procure talent and execute the campaign.Of the $2.5 million, Gentle Monster says it sent $500,000 to “Donda Social Agency, Inc.,” which Gentle Monster believed to be Kanye West’s charity. In June 2018, however, the West-co-founded nonprofit Donda’s House changed its name to Art of Culture, Inc.Gentle Monster is suing Malik Yusef, his manager and business partner Burundi Partlow, and Sonja Nutall, who introduced Won Lee to Yusef. The company is seeking relief for fraud, breach of contract, and more. Find the lawsuit below (via ).Earlier this year, German fashion brand Philipp Plein claimed that Malik Yusef and Burundi Partlow scammed the company out of $900,000 after Yusef claimed he could book West to appear at the brand’s New York Fashion Week event.

"Many books have been written about R.E.M., and Robert Dean Lurie knows it. It’s the first thing he mentions in his own new biography of the band, . But few tomes have focused closely on R.E.M.’s origins in the burgeoning musical community of Athens, Georgia, in the 1980s. Thus, as Lurie explains, “several local figures who were pivotal in the band’s early history have been underrepresented in previous accounts, even completely omitted in some cases.”To offset those omissions, Lurie approaches  like a detective as much as a biographer. He tracks down people who had small but important roles in the R.E.M. legend, seeking corroborations (or debunkings) of many myths about the group. In the process, Lurie inserts himself in his narrative, and sometimes in extraneous ways that derail his momentum. But his own story does matter: Inspired by the band, he enrolled at the University of Georgia in Athens (the school its members dropped out of) just as R.E.M. was becoming one of the biggest rock bands in America. So he knows a lot about the town, and that helps him uncover new info about a band whose history has already been well scoured.Here are some of the things we learned about R.E.M. from .In one common legend, R.E.M. frontman Michael Stipe was inspired to sing after hearing Patti Smith’s 1975 album . Lurie can’t quite confirm or deny that, but he does find something just as crucial to Stipe’s future as a vocalist: a 1977 battle of the bands at his high school in St. Louis. Stipe’s classmate Craig Franklin asked him to enter and says Stipe replied, “I don’t sing.” But Franklin eventually convinced Stipe to join his group—called simply the Band—on covers of the Rolling Stones’ “Gimme Shelter” and Rush’s “Working Man,” likely his first-ever public performance.Another R.E.M. legend holds that the group chose its name when Stipe randomly found the acronym for rapid eye movement in a dictionary. But according to Athens scenester William Orten “Ort” Carlton, “That’s not right at all. The band was actually named after Ralph Eugene Meatyard.” As proof, he offers that Meatyard—an obscure, Kentucky-based photographer—signed his prints as “r.e.m.” and that Stipe often asked Ort about his work. Despite heavy digging, Lurie can’t definitively prove that Meatyard inspired the band’s name, but he reasonably concludes that there’s some truth to Ort’s story.In the early 1980s, Athens was a hotbed of musical creativity, with many bands involving art students from the University of Georgia. Surrounded by pioneers like Pylon, the B-52’s, and Love Tractor, R.E.M. initially seemed pretty square, in part because they played more covers than originals. “I recognized early that they were like the ‘digestible-by-frat-boys’ version of the Athens sound,” says Mike Green of the Fans, a contemporaneous Atlanta band. That didn’t last long: By the release of R.E.M.’s debut  in 1983, the group’s jangly, Byrds-inflected sound stood out not only locally but around the national college radio scene. (And for the record, R.E.M.’s members were always fans of their Athens cohort: They all wanted to be in Love Tractor, and drummer Bill Berry actually was, quitting only when R.E.M. got too busy for him to play in both groups.)Despite R.E.M.’s rather conventional rock beginnings, Stipe was always interested in experimental music. In 1981, he played solo under the name 1066 Gaggle O’ Sound, which his UGA art school classmate David Pierce describes in the book: “He did a dub thing where he’d play a loop of himself and it would come back around and he’d play over that. He’d have a tape recorder which would rewind and play that back and then he’d play along with the recording he’d just made.” Stipe was also in the experimental band Boat Of with Tom Smith, later a noise legend and leader of To Live and Shave in L.A. And he played organ with Pierce in the “full-bore art rock bordering on prog” group Tanzplagen, which actually toured and released a single.Lurie hears some charming stories about R.E.M.’s early tours, which got bigger with each record. Jeff Walls of Guadalcanal Diary recalls that when opening for R.E.M. in 1985, his band filled out a questionnaire that included a request for each member’s shoe size. “Next day, there was a package at the front of our hotel room with shoes, T-shirts, all this stuff that was useful on a tour,” he explains. “It was much appreciated.” And according to assistant tour manager Chris Edwards, R.E.M. “would stay after the show and talk to everybody that wanted to talk… until the fans were tired of talking. They were just so gracious with their time.”During one mid-’80s tour, Stipe started sporting bleach-blonde hair, inspired not by fashion trends but a condiment. According to Edwards, Stipe spotted a bowl of mustard backstage one night and said, “Doesn’t it make you want to stick your head in it?” Edwards said no, but Stipe did it anyway, emerging on stage with a new, rather pungent look. For a few weeks, Stipe wore a different kind of mustard on his head every night (“his favorite was French’s,” says Edwards) until finally taking the easier route and dyeing his hair.When R.E.M.’s fourth album  came out in 1986, it seemed more straightforward than its predecessor, 1985’s murkier  But  was initially intended as a concept album, as R.E.M. recorded a dozen short instrumental tracks to fit between longer songs. Producer Don Gehman convinced the band to ditch that interstitial material; some of it became proper songs, such as “Underneath the Bunker,” which Stipe quickly wrote words for just before it was recorded.Berry’s decision to leave R.E.M. in 1997 was surprising, primarily because he decided to become a farmer instead. But in the ’80s, when Berry was dating Kathleen O’Brien—a key figure largely responsible for the band members meeting—he confessed his farming dreams to her during a drive through north Georgia. Encountering a local farmer, “they spent the better part of the afternoon riding a tractor over the man’s fields,” writes Lurie, “and Bill was about the happiest Kathleen had ever seen him.”",articles4,"['R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'Michael Stipe', 'Stipe’s', 'Stipe', 'Stipe', 'Rush’s', 'Stipe', 'Stipe', 'Ort’s', 'Pylon', 'Love Tractor', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'Stipe', 'Stipe', 'Boat Of', 'Tom Smith', 'To Live', 'Tanzplagen', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'Stipe', 'Stipe', 'Edwards', 'Stipe', 'Stipe', 'Edwards', 'R.E.M.', 'R.E.M.', 'Berry’s', 'R.E.M.']"

Carried by gentle rhythms, glowing synth pads, jazzy guitar licks, trilling flutes, and astral crescendos, it sounds something like the “energize” effect on “Star Trek” as transposed for a jazz band. Led by Pacific Northwest multi-instrumentalist Erin Elizabeth Birgy, the music is vast and refined, hinting at chaos but never quite losing control. The journey is mirrored in the lyrics: a story woven together from first names, fragmented questions, and disconnected memories. “I could make it clear,” Birgy sings near the end, “You belong here.” Rumbling beneath her before snapping back into focus, the band is equally adept at sweeping you away and pulling you in.",articles4,"['Mega Bog’s', 'Pacific Northwest']"

"The rapper allegedly facilitated foreign contributions to a U.S. presidential candidate in 2012Former Fugees’ member Prakazrel “Pras” Michel has been charged with campaign finance crimes in federal court, the Department of Justice announced today (May 10). The four-count indictment charges Pras with “conspiracy to defraud the United States government and for making foreign and conduit campaign contributions,” as well as “one count of a scheme to conceal material facts and two counts of making a false entry in a record in connection with the conspiracy.”According to the U.S. Justice Department, Pras facilitated the transfer of approximately $21,600,000 into the United States by a Malaysian businessman named Low Taek Jho (aka “Jho Low”), who was also charged in the indictment. The money was reportedly brought into the country between June 2012 and November 2012 for the purposes of “funneling significant sums of money into the United States presidential election as purportedly legitimate contributions, all while concealing the true source of the money.” It is unclear which 2012 candidate or candidates were the planned recipients of the money.When reached for comment by Pitchfork, Pras’ attorney Barry J. Pollack stated: “Mr. Michel is extremely disappointed that so many years after the fact the government would bring charges related to 2012 campaign contributions. Mr. Michel is innocent of these charges and looks forward to having the case heard by a jury.”A spokesperson for Mr. Low issued the following statement via his attorneys: “Mr. Low is innocent—and he is presumed innocent under U.S. law.  The allegations against Mr. Low have no basis in fact: Mr. Low has never made any campaign contributions directly or indirectly in the U.S. and he unequivocally denies any involvement in or knowledge of the alleged activities.”The indictment reads that Pras distributed approximately $865,000 to “straw donors” to help conceal the source of the campaign contributions, and additionally violated Federal Election Commission (FEC) guidelines along the way.

"Listen to the track belowKelly Lee Owens created the new track “Let It Go” as fodder for a recent set at London’s Fabric nightclub, and it’s not hard to imagine it going over like gangbusters: Layering beckoning whispers over a pile-driving bass pulse, the peak-time cut strikes a clever balance of soft and hard, just the thing for guiding clubbers into the maelstrom of the early morning. But another song she released alongside it is a lot subtler, and maybe more interesting, too.Where “Let It Go” aims straight down the middle, “Omen” slinks around the murkiest corners of the club. It rides atop a dubbed-out electro groove that’s all shadows and spiderwebs, with a kick drum so muted that it seems to float, ghostlike, a foot above the ground. Minor-key synth squiggles and moody bass riffs evoke the goosebump-inducing sound of early-1990s bleep techno, skeletal and sere. Like many of the best moments of Owens’ self-titled debut album, it injects dance-music convention with a heavy dose of mystery.",articles4,"['Lee Owens', 'Owens’']"

"Where would we be without our mothers? With less good music in the world, for one. To celebrate Mother’s Day, Pitchfork staffers share their favorite songs that were inspired by moms or highlight motherly pearls of wisdom.Whenever Philomena Lynott went to see Thin Lizzy perform, her son, Phil, requested she sit in the center seat in the balcony. That way, when the stage light struck his iconic black Fender Precision bass, he could reflect its glow back up to see her. It was a sweet gesture, indicative of the close relationship they shared, though all those shows took their toll on Philomena. “The music would start: ,” she recalled in 2017. “I think they injured my eardrums.”Lynott took his adoration a step further in 1974, naming a swaggering battle anthem after his mother. It’s one of his most triumphant, heartfelt letters home: “Give her all of my love,” he sings. “For she has a heart of gold there/As good as God above.” He narrates from somewhere far away, bemoaning the distance his career creates between them. But he’s using his light to shine her way. A week or so after our daughter was born, my wife made a Spotify playlist to listen to while rocking her to sleep, including Roberta Flack’s “The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,” Bill Withers’ “Lovely Day,” and Nat King Cole’s “Cachito.” Overwhelmed by emotion and hormones, she later told me, she found herself listening through it with our daughter in her arms and weeping with joy, along with a host of harder-to-pinpoint feelings.Last week, driving our daughter—now almost four—to school, we dialed up the playlist. The playful, Spanish-language “Cachito” made for a great singalong as always, but as we pulled into the parking lot, I realized that my wife was wiping a tear from her eye. The song on the stereo was the Carpenters’ “(They Long to Be) Close to You,” a tune about birds singing, stars falling, and angels sprinkling moondust. It’s so innocent that it’s definitely kitschy and almost corny. The lyrics actually scan as romantic, but a key line (“On the day that you were born the angels got together/And decided to create a dream come true”) works just as well for mothers and fathers beaming upon their offspring. Some songs—the best songs—defy all our attempts to retain composure, and thank goodness for that. Our mothers help us take our first steps and discover our favorite foods, in the process cobbling together the outline of who we become. Mitski begins “Your Best American Girl” singing, “Your mother would not approve of how my mother raised me.” She is anguished by romantic yearning, the kind where you pretend to be someone your crush desires at the expense of who you really are. At my lowest moments in high school, when a boy asked me if I use curry as a chaser (yes, for alcohol) and called me and all my friends “The Indians” (...we weren’t all Indian), I wanted nothing more than to change how I was raised.I still feel an acute sense of heartache at the way I funneled my pain toward my mother, rather than my crush. I yelled and cried and demanded she cook hamburgers and change the ways she pronounced words. This regret has lingered longer than any romantic rejection. “Your Best American Girl” provides some solace, though. Toward the end of the song, as the guitars and drums thrash, Mitski reaches some kind of resolution, if not entirely catharsis. In the video, she stands alone, singing for herself, and maybe for her mother too. Sampha wrote  his debut album, in the two years between when his mother was diagnosed with stomach cancer and when she passed away. Every song on the record is heart-wrenching, and “Kora Sings” is a stunning demonstration of how grief can be so many things: frantic, debilitating, unfathomable. “You’ve been with me, you’re my angel/Please don’t you disappear,” Sampha beckons over a swirl of crunchy electronics and frenzied drumming. At the heart of the song is the kora, a West African harp-like instrument that flows mystically, like the sonic equivalent of glitter. Its strings feel like a small way in which Sampha honors his mother, suggesting a glimmer of beauty and hope amid loss. While on maternity leave a couple of years ago, I watched the entire series run of “Gilmore Girls” while nursing my newborn daughter. The show’s theme music, a version of Carole King’s “Where You Lead,” is probably the song my daughter has heard the most times in her nearly two years of life. (“Baby Shark” is currently giving it a run for its money, though.) Originally recorded for King’s 1971 album  as an ode to romantic fidelity, “Where You Lead” was re-imagined in 2000 for “Gilmore Girls” as a pledge of maternal devotion, sung as a duet between King and her daughter, Louise Goffin. My  LP used to be my mom’s; it has her initials written on the cover  the record’s center label, to prevent it from getting stolen from her dorm room. One day, I’ll pass it down to my daughter, along with all my “Gilmore Girls” DVDs. Every time I listen to this ballad from , I become a puddle of tears. Written as a surprise for Swift’s mom Andrea, “The Best Day” perfectly captures the nostalgia of childhood and the feeling of security that a parent can provide. Swift recalls a harsh memory involving middle school mean girls; to distract her daughter from the pain, Andrea drove them to a town far away. They don’t get up to much on this little adventure, but it doesn’t matter—the company is enough. “Don’t know how long it’s gonna take to feel okay/But I know I had the best day/With you today.” Recently, I was very sick and my mom traveled to visit me. We didn’t do anything notable together, but when it came time for her to leave, I knew exactly what Swift meant. In 1950, a 20-year-old singer-songwriter named Lula Mae Hardaway gave birth to her son six weeks early. Though the boy, Stevland, was born with the ability to see, side effects from the medical intervention left him permanently blind. As Stevland grew older and took after his mother musically, she nurtured his gift and helped him sign his first record deal with Motown. He was 11 years old.It’s this backstory that makes Stevie Wonder’s cover of “My Mother’s Eyes,“ a Tin Pan Alley classic from before Lula was born, so incredibly poignant. Performed here during a TV special about celebrities and their mothers, it‘s a perfect encapsulation of the legend’s relationship with his mom. Lula was Stevie’s eyes—a woman who poured her entire life into giving her son the opportunity to flourish. When he sings, “God's gift sent from above/A real unselfish love/I found in my mother's eyes,” you know he means every word. Throughout my childhood, my mom quoted the best line from “Kooks” so often—“And if the homework brings you down/Then we’ll throw it on the fire and take the car downtown”—that it almost sounds foreign to me coming out of David Bowie’s mouth. He wrote “Kooks” for his newborn son in 1971, in the process creating his own manual for unorthodox child rearing; my mom dog-eared many of its pages. Under her roof, milkshakes were an acceptable breakfast food, playing hooky was a basic human right, and bed-in movie marathons were always encouraged. She understood the hidden wisdom of “Kooks”: that childhood is brief and should be carefree and joyous. It was a concept I couldn’t grasp until years later, when in hindsight I realized that throwing just one homework assignment into the flames wouldn’t have killed me. Local Natives’ second album, , is a truly sad record, largely inspired by singer Kelcey Ayer losing his mother to breast cancer. The evening I’d planned to see Local Natives perform in 2016, my own mother told me she had discovered an alarming lump in her breast; she said, “It’s probably cancer,” then insisted I wipe my tears and see the band anyway. In a bittersweet moment, they played “Colombia,” a  piano number in which Ayer challenges his virtues after his mother’s death, doubting he can match her capacity for love and selflessness. On this evening in particular, the song assured me that even if my mom’s cancer won, she had raised me strong enough to endure the grief. She’s now cancer-free, but I still find peace of mind in the song’s mantra: “If you never felt all of my love/I pray now you do.” ",articles4,"['Mother’s Day', 'Thin Lizzy', 'Roberta Flack’s', 'Nat King Cole’s', 'Every', 'Carole King', 'King’s', 'Written', 'Swift’s', 'Andrea', 'Andrea', 'Stevie Wonder’s', 'Stevie’s', 'David Bowie']"

"“I have always likened listening to older work to looking at junior high year book photos”St. Vincent has penned a new essay for her fan newsletter, reflecting on the making of her second studio album Actor, which recently turned 10.As the story goes, Annie Clark had done recording sessions with a producer (who remains nameless) before eventually linking up with John Congleton (who she calls “Johnny C.”) for what would eventually become . In the essay, she likens the first producer to an “abusive father figure” and calls him an “idealist-cum-emotional-fascist.”“I was lost. I had all kinds of words and melodies but was so beaten up by the other process that I didn’t know how to tie them with these pristine moments,” she wrote. “[Congleton] told me to go home and write a song in a night. So I wrote ‘Actor Out of Work’ at my mom’s house in my childhood bedroom. I felt like a fraud. I felt like people were frauds. I wanted to be hit. I wanted to hit.”Clark goes on to describe the process behind her collaboration with Congleton as they crafted and reworked the songs that ended up on , which included “painstaking” piano recording (on “The Party”) and lots of conversations: “Lots of Hunky’s veggie burgers and Subway sandwiches and talking. Talking sincere. Talking shit. Making each other laugh with stories about growing up. About Texas. About growing up in Texas,” she wrote.Clark closes: “I haven’t listened to that record in a while. I have always likened listening to older work to looking at junior high year book photos... Recognize that time is elastic. Notes are elastic. Lyrics elastic. Could have been anything.  Any songs, any ideas at all, anyone at that time.  But it was those songs and those ideas and that process and that person.  And I am (humbly) proud of it.  And so happy that  made it to the ears and hearts it did.” Read the full essay here.",articles4,"['Vincent', 'Recognize']"
"Listen to the track belowDenzel Curry is among the more quietly influential rappers of the last few years. Alongside Ronny J, he pioneered the punishing, bass-boosted moshers that swept South Florida, creating a blueprint for Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, Ski Mask the Slump God, and Smokepurpp, among others, and breaking the sound barrier for other SoundCloud outsiders. Despite this particular contribution, he is a versatile talent who is as comfortable trading bars with Joey Bada$$ as he is belting out melodies. His new song “RICKY” is a retrospective, tracking the advice he received through his formative years and how the perspectives of those around him shaped the man and rapper he is now.On “RICKY,” Curry’s condensed verses are packed with instructions for surviving his Carol City hometown—instructions that apparently shaped his entire outlook. His raps are more personalized chants than anything else; he recites the hook to himself like a little prayer or mantra. Though less adrenalized than many of his verses, they’re still performed like gospel. Eventually he reveals how these lessons shaped his life arc, dipping briefly into ’s “Parents” and alluding to his time in Raider Klan, all the while making his place in the hierarchy clear. “We was lit, y’all wasn’t even shit yet/We was Three 6, Wu-Tang mixed with Dipset,” he snarls.

"Last year, sales of vinyl records were at a 30-year high. But while the vinyl boom has been a bright spot for physical media lovers and the record industry alike, pressing vinyl poses a more urgent environmental concern than it did in the format’s heyday. At times, the process can seem almost antithetical to green living. Records are made of PVC, which comes from refined oil and can take up to 1,000 years to decompose in a landfill. Traditional pressing machines are powered by steam boilers that require fossil fuels to generate heat and pressure; the water used is treated with anti-corrosive chemicals in order to prevent rusting, thus creating more wastewater. And that’s just the pressing procedure.Consider, then, vinyl’s packaging and distribution. While leading packaging companies like TC Transcontinental use recycled or sustainably sourced paper and cardboard, there’s no regulation forcing their competitors to take similar steps. The ink that’s used to print cover art and liner notes is traditionally solvent-based, meaning it contains volatile organic compounds that can contribute to the production of ozone. Once the record is encased in a beautiful jacket, it’s then shrink-wrapped in plastic wrap before boarding a gas-burning, carbon-emitting truck to ship. Suddenly the listener’s choice to buy physical music shifts from an action that helps sustain an artist’s career, to one that potentially threatens broader sustainability.While some big-name artists have experimented with environmental offset initiatives—Pink Floyd donated proceeds from 2001’s  to help plant four new indigenous forests, Coldplay did something similar with mango trees for 2002’s —such gestures have remained out of reach for many independent musicians and labels, both logistically and financially. But through recent innovations like steamless record presses and the growing ubiquity of carbon offset projects, there are more ways than ever to put out vinyl and still be eco-conscious.In March, Canadian producer (and environmental toxicologist) Jayda G released her debut album, , via the indie label Ninja Tune. On the back jacket of the vinyl version, the fine print states that the record’s packaging is carbon neutral, meaning that the emissions generated are offset since the album reduces CO2 emissions in another part of the world. In this case, record sales help fund a clean water project in Odisha, India, where people usually burn open fires to sanitize their drinking water. According to ClimatePartner,  has offset 1,024 kilograms of CO2 to date.Even before issuing , Ninja Tune had been trying to make their records in a more environmentally friendly way, said Sean Preston, the London-based label’s head of manufacturing. This meant cutting down on single-use plastics, PVC dust bags, stickers, and toxic varnishes that add a glossy finish to record jackets. Considering the conservation-related concepts at the heart of , the album “kicked us up the arse a little bit” when it came to finding climate-neutral options, he added. Some steps of the vinyl production process are simply out of a label’s hands, however. “One of the first things we tried looking at was shrink wrap replacement,” Preston said. “You could not use shrink wrap at all, but the problem with that is, quite a few territories in Europe will do shrink wrap themselves. Just because we're not doing it doesn’t mean someone else down the chain won’t… We’re not only trying to change ourselves—we're trying to change the way people do business.”On the pressing plant side of things, the Toronto startup Viryl Technologies introduced, in 2017, one of the first newly designed (rather than rehabbed) models since the 1980s, called the WarmTone. At the top of this year, Viryl launched a steamless option, which is powered by electricity instead of water pressure and can be retrofitted to any Viryl press. According to co-founder Chad Brown, there’s not a drastic performance difference between the company’s steamless and steam-powered options. “Steam is very good for heating record molds rapidly, so you’ll get a slightly faster cycle time,” Brown said. “With steam, a 24- to 28-second cycle time is achievable. Steamless, we hit 31 seconds.”Putting aside about a five-second lag, there are some economic benefits to steamless presses. You don’t have to hire someone to maintain the boiler, and your water bill goes way down. (The whole system feasibly could run on renewable energy, assuming the pressing plant committed to solar power or wind energy.) Brown claims that Viryl’s steamless presses have been selling rapidly at $200,000 a pop, mostly to boutique pressing companies with only one to three machines. These are small operations compared North America’s largest plant, Nashville’s United Record Pressing, which boasts 38 traditional presses and can churn out over 60,000 records a day.One such boutique pressing company, Chicago’s Smashed Plastic, launched in February with a single steamless model from Viryl. According to co-founder Andy Weber, the company faced a logistical nightmare before discovering the non-traditional option: If they wanted to get a boiler built, they were going to need approval from the city and have an engineer on duty at all times. Steamless, essentially, made their business viable. The company has serviced mostly Chicago indie labels (Feeltrip Records, Midwest Action) and local DIY bands—which adds another layer of sustainability. “The best part is, everybody we’ve done business with comes and picks up their records,” Weber said.With steamless systems being so new, it’s unrealistic to expect instant ubiquity, particularly among larger plants. But there are ways to act sustainably without replacing every press. Record Technologies Inc. in Camarillo, California, has been operating since 1972 on a traditional boiler setup. Due in part to Southern California’s mandated smog checks, the company uses clean-burning natural gas, rather than traditional fossil fuel, to power their system. “We’ve had more stringent regulations to abide by, but part of it is also because we want to be more responsible,” said RTI plant manager Rick Hashimoto. “It’s for the good of everyone.”Jack White’s eight-press Third Man plant in Detroit launched in 2017 with a closed-loop water system, which minimizes wastewater through recycling. For now, they use steam-powered but relatively energy-efficient Newbilt presses. “Electric presses definitely have our attention,” added Third Man production manager (and White’s brother) Eddie Gillis via email.As word continues to spread, Brown remains hopeful about the rise of sustainable vinyl practices. “We’re fully expecting artists and labels to start asking for their vinyl to be pressed on steamless,” he said, adding that Viryl has partnered with a yet-to-be-announced major-label artist on a mobile steamless pressing plant. It’s slated to roll out in Nashville at the end of May, and from there will be available for use at stadium shows, festivals, and wherever else people might want to buy some vinyl.While artists have the power to bring awareness to new green practices, a responsibility also falls on listeners to potentially pay a little more for eco-friendly products. Stoughton Printing, a California-based music packaging company, has long taken financial risks so that their record sleeves would be both high quality and sustainably made. Their president Jack Stoughton, Jr. raises a good point: “If you, the consumer, are willing to lay down $40 for a top-notch record today, whether the jacket cost 25 cents more really doesn’t make a difference to you.”",articles4,"['oil', 'Traditional', 'Pink Floyd', 'Jayda G', 'CO2', 'CO2', 'Brown', 'Steamless', 'Midwest Action', 'Third Man', 'Third Man']"

"Radiohead are also planning “something really cool” with  ephemeraThom Yorke has spoken about his “dystopian” new solo album in a cover feature for Crack magazine, saying the record is influenced by his ongoing anxieties and fears about world events. He cites Flying Lotus’ semi-improvized live shows as an inspiration on the as-yet-untitled LP, set for release on XL. “We suddenly realised this is a new way to write stuff,” he tells writer Thomas Frost. “I would send [producer Nigel Godrich] completely unfinished, sprawling tracks and he would focus in on the bits and pieces that he thought would work, build them up into samples and loops, and then throw them back at me, where I would start writing vocals.”He goes on to describe a trip to Tokyo that left him jet lagged, after which he began to see “these images [where] humans and rats changed places. A dream. And as I came out, I woke up with this really strong set of images of girls in tottering heels, but they’re actually rats and the human beings are in the drains. I had another one, these weird images of the city of London and all the skyscrapers are just shuffling along.” He adds, “For some reason I thought a really good way of expressing anxiety creatively was in a dystopian environment.”He also discusses Radiohead’s response to damning reviews of Kid A, before alluding to a forthcoming release of ephemera for the era. “I recently found this box file of all the faxes I was sending and receiving from Stanley [Donwood, visual artist] about the artwork and they’re hilarious,” he says. “I’ve got all this stuff, pages and pages and photocopies, that I just left strewn around the studios. Nigel picked them up and thought, ‘We’d better keep these.’ I was so focused and at the same time angry, confused, paranoid. I’m looking at all these people involved, going ‘Who the fuck are these people?!’ We’re going to do something really cool with all that material.”For the first time, he also spoke at length about his first classical compositions, debuted earlier this year. “The thing with Katia and Marielle Labèque,” he said, referring to the pianists who performed the piece, is that “it started as a joke. They were asking me, ‘You should write some piano music for us,’ and I’m like, ‘Hah hah, I guess. I can’t read music’.... It was the weirdest feeling building something on the laptop and handing it over to these two incredible musicians. The work was based on a few ideas of using probability and arpeggiators, a very electronic state of mind, and suddenly they’re playing it like it’s a piece by Schumann or Ravel!”Elsewhere, he talks about squaring Radiohead’s tour requirements with environmental activism and the need for a “fundamental” change in our political system, which is “unsustainable in a million ways.” Read the wide-ranging interview at .Read “Thom Yorke’s Contemporary Classical Debut Is a Daring Triumph: Live Review.”",articles4,"['Radiohead', 'Thomas Frost', 'Nigel Godrich', 'Radiohead’s', 'Katia', 'Marielle Labèque', 'I’m', 'Radiohead’s']"
"Woodstock claims that investors stole $17.8 million from the fest’s bank accountWoodstock 50, LLC has filed for a court order against the investors who recently pulled their financial support of the festival, TMZ reports and Pitchfork can confirm. In the verified petition, filed yesterday (May 8) in a New York court, a lawyer for Woodstock 50 argues that Dentsu violated an agreement with Woodstock 50 and is asking for an order that would see “Dentsu cease all communications relating to the Festival,” return $17.8 million to Woodstock’s bank account, award financial relief to Woodstock, and more.“W50 [Woodstock 50, LLC] was blindsided by Dentsu’s announcement, and shocked and outraged that Dentsu claimed the right to unilaterally cancel the Festival—an action that is expressly barred by its Agreement with W50,” the lawyer writes. “Dentsu’s sabotage did not stop with its unauthorized and improper cancellation announcement. Dentsu also pillaged the Festival bank account on its way out, taking all of the $17.8 million in the account earmarked for Festival production costs.”The Financing and Production Agreement between Amplifi Live, LLC and Woodstock 50, LLC (filed as an exhibit in the case and viewed by Pitchfork) states, “Any decision to cancel the Festival shall be jointly made in writing by the Parties.” In addition, the Agreement includes the following passage:Neither Party shall make any public announcement confirming musical or
other performing talent at the Festival, or any other public
announcement that may restrict the ability of the Parties to obtain
refunds from musical or other performing talent, until the Parties
have mutually agreed in writing to make such type of public
announcement for the first time (the “Initial Festival Announcement”).Pitchfork has contacted representatives and attorneys for Woodstock 50, LLC, as well as Dentsu.The allegations in the verified petition reflect claims that Woodstock co-creator Michael Lang made in a letter to Dentsu earlier this week. In his letter, Lang wrote that Dentsu “illegally swept approximately $17 million from the festival bank account.” In addition, he claimed that the company was responsible for blocking ticket sales and that Dentsu also suggested to performers, the venue, and vendors that they should cut ties with Lang.Update (05/09 2:38 p.m. Eastern): A representative for Woodstock 50 says that a hearing regarding the festival organizers’ verified petition has been scheduled for Monday, May 13, and that a gag order has been handed down to Dentsu by the court.

"After years of issues, the festival is attempting to finalize a new South Florida locationAfter years of setbacks, Florida’s Ultra Music Festival is leaving Miami in search of a new permanent home. In an open letter posted today (May 8) on the festival’s Twitter account, organizers stated that they had “voluntarily terminated our City of Miami license and thank them for being a part of our story for the past two decades.” The letter went on to say that the festival is “now finalizing a new South Florida location that will serve as an incredible and permanent home for Ultra Music Festival.” Find the full letter below.The news follows years of issues related to the festival. Back in 2014, a security guard was trampled by concertgoers, winding up in critical condition. The incident eventually led Miami city officials (including the Mayor) to call for an end to the festival. That same weekend, a man died at Ultra. More recently, a new study found that high sound levels from this year’s festival caused “a significant stress response” in fish swimming in waters near the Ultra’s site. The sound created stress levels similar to the ones that fish would experience if they were being chased by a predator.This year’s Ultra Music Festival was held at Virginia Key—an island connected to mainland Miami by a single highway. In addition to distressed fish, Ultra’s free shuttle service was overwhelmed and eventually suspended at this year’s festival, forcing many concertgoers to walk two-and-a-half miles from Virginia Key back to the mainland, according to a report by Billboard.Ultra addressed this year’s festival in their letter, stating: “After listening to feedback from many of you (including over 20,000 fans who took our post-event survey) it is clear that the festival experience on Virginia Key was simply not good enough.”Read “Colonel Sanders at the Rave: Kentucky Fried Chicken’s Presence at Ultra Music Festival Was Disturbing” on the Pitch.https://twitter.com/ultra/status/1126230954329219073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1126230954329219073&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.billboard.com%2Farticles%2Fnews%2Fdance%2F8510690%2Fultra-festival-leaves-miami",articles4,[]

"Miami City Commission will determine tomorrow whether the electronic music event will be allowed to return to the barrier island of Virginia KeyA new study from the University of Miami has found that high sound levels from Ultra Music Festival 2019 caused “a significant stress response” in fish swimming in waters near the EDM festival's site, similar to the stress levels that they would experience if they were being chased by a predator. Following the study’s release, Ultra announced that it is seeking a new South Florida location.The University of Miami’s Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science has an experimental hatchery and research operations on Virginia Key, the barrier island near Miami where Ultra was held this past year. During the festival, which took place in March, they conducted tests on toadfish at the hatchery and also monitored decibel levels in their tanks and the surrounding waters. On May 6, the university issued their first official findings, stating that the high volume levels caused toadfish to experience a “4-to-5-fold increase in blood cortisol, their main stress hormone, during the first night of the Ultra Music Festival.”“The stress response was higher than what would be experienced when being chased by a simulated predator and similar to when hearing bottlenose dolphins, a toadfish predator,” said Danielle McDonald, professor of marine biology and ecology at the UM Rosenstiel School, in a statement.Hydrophone recordings revealed a 7-9 decibel increase in the toadfish tanks and a 2-3 decibel increase in the low frequency range in Bear Cut, the channel that runs between Virginia Key and neighboring Key Biscayne. “Variations in the sonic activity of marine organisms and additional noise from boat traffic may have contributed to the signal detected in Bear Cut during Ultra,” said Claire Paris, professor of ocean sciences. Paris states that more studies are necessary to gauge the potential long-term impact Ultra has had on the wild fish population in the Virginia Key area.In the wake of the festival, humans made noise complaints as well. Speaking to CBS Miami in early April, Mayor Francis Suarez voiced concerns about how loud the music at Ultra was. “I let the organizers know before the event, I let them know during the event, and I’m certainly going to let them know after the event that low frequency bass penetrating miles into the city is not acceptable,” he said at the time. “I live seven miles away and I could hear it at my house. It’s something that’s a big problem and it’s something that’s non-negotiable for me.”The University of Miami researchers made their concerns regarding the effect of high volume levels on nearby fish populations known as early as November 2018. At the time, festival organizers stated that they would work alongside environmental regulators and that loud music would not reach the toadfish tanks, as the Miami Herald reports. According to Key News, preliminary findings from the study were presented to the local Virginia Key Advisory Board last month. The board has since formally objected to Ultra being held on Virginia Key again in 2020.The University of Miami findings are not the only reason that citizens of Virginia Key and Key Biscayne are protesting the return of Ultra to their area. During an April 11 advisory board meeting, Key Biscayne Mayor Michael Davey objected to the festival’s license being renewed for 2020, citing noise complaints, garbage issues, and most notably transportation infrastructure problems that plagued the 2019 edition of the festival.Severe congestion held up a planned fleet of 200 buses, which were supposed to shuttle festival-goers back to Miami after the first night of the festival. This resulted in many attendees walking nearly three miles back to Miami across the Rickenbacker Causeway. “Obviously the first day we had some hiccups if you will with our transportation plan,” Ultra head of security Ray Martinez told CBS Miami in April. “We made adjustments as we moved forward and I can tell you Sunday night it worked flawlessly.”The Miami City Commission was set to review Ultra’s license agreement with the city tomorrow.",articles4,"['Hydrophone', 'Claire Paris', 'I’m', 'Virginia Key']"

"A Cook County judge has reversed a previous decision and will allow the case to proceedThis past February, R. Kelly was sued by a woman named Heather Williams who claims he sexually abused her in 1998 when she was 16 years old. In April, a Cook County, Illinois judge issued a default judgment against Kelly after he failed to appear in court. Now, the judge has vacated her default ruling, allowing Kelly to defend himself in court, TMZ and the Chicago Sun-Times report. According to the , the next court date is scheduled for June 19. Pitchfork has reached out to R. Kelly’s attorneys Zaid M. Abdallah and Raed Shalabi, as well as attorneys for Heather Williams.Abadallah and Shalabi had previously argued that R. Kelly failed to respond to court summonses because he is illiterate. “The defendant does not recall being served,” they reportedly wrote in a filing. “The Defendant [R. Kelly] suffers from a learning disability that adversely affects his ability to read, in essence he cannot.” According to the , Shalabi said today (May 8), “He [Kelly] didn’t know what the documents were. Once we found out there was a judgment against him we filed a motion to vacate right away.”Heather Williams is seeking at least $50,000 in damages in her lawsuit against R. Kelly. She is also one of four women who Illinois prosecutors claim Kelly abused in their criminal case against the singer.

"Lack of evidence led coroner to record an open conclusion in the Prodigy singer’s death at age 49An inquest has declined to rule Keith Flint’s death a suicide,  reports. “We will never quite know what was going on in his mind on that date,” a coroner said. The Prodigy singer had unspecified amounts of cocaine, alcohol, and codeine in his system when his body was found at his home in March, she said. The week after his death, a coroner confirmed Flint had died by hanging but not whether he intended to take his own life.Explaining her open conclusion, the coroner said: “I’ve considered suicide. To record that, I would have to have found that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr. Flint formed the idea and took a deliberate action knowing it would result in his death. Having regard to all the circumstances I don’t find that there’s enough evidence for that.” She also found insufficient evidence to rule his death an accident, in which he may have been “larking around and it all went horribly wrong.”Yesterday (May 7), the Prodigy wrote on Twitter:https://twitter.com/the_prodigy/status/1125792489380696064?s=21",articles4,"['Prodigy', 'Flint’s']"

"Invisible HitsAs their name suggests, Stereolab were one of the ultimate studio bands. Over the course of two decades and dozens of releases, the “groop” (as they often referred to themselves) stitched together a dizzying patchwork of influences, from krautrock, free jazz, and minimalism to electronica, exotica, and yé-yé. Their painstakingly crafted sound remains vibrant and inspiring, particularly on 1993’s  (recently reissued in expanded form) and 1997’s . But Stereolab amounted to more than a series of intricate studio experiments. They were also a powerhouse live act from 1990 through 2009, when they went on “extended hiatus.” Stereolab returns to the stage later this month at Primavera Sound, with an extensive world tour to follow (including a stop at Pitchfork Music Festival in July). In anticipation of the comeback, let’s revisit a handful of their live highlights over the years.Then a couple, Laetitia Sadier and Tim Gane formed Stereolab in 1990 from the ashes of McCarthy, the indie-pop band Gane had co-founded in the ’80s. Stereolab’s debut EP, , came out on their own Duophonic label in May of ’91, kicking off a feverish spell of releases and gigs. This late ’91 Camcorder capture of a cramped in-store performance at London’s Rough Trade shop is an intimate look at the band’s raw early days. Whereas their late-career shows were marked by a sometimes obsessively tight sound, there’s a rambling feel to this set, which is highlighted by the churning motorik glories of early standout “The Light Will Cease to Fail.”With the addition of drummer Andy Ramsay, keyboardist Katharine Gifford, and guitarist/vocalist Mary Hansen in 1992, Stereolab’s “classic” lineup soon fell into place. It’s this version of the band that we see blasting through a 50-minute set in late 1993, casually blowing minds. Powered by Ramsay’s hypnotic beat, early single “Jenny Ondioline” stretches out well past the 12-minute mark, as the band rides a billowing, blown-out wave of Neu!-inspired beauty. They may look a little glum onstage, but the music is positively joyous.In spite of Stereolab’s then-obscure influences and Sadier’s Marx-inflected lyrics, the band soon found itself garnering attention outside of the underground—which led to some slightly awkward moments. Their 1994 appearance on the UK TV program “The Word” features the incongruous spectacle of go-go dancers shaking along to a revved-up rendition of the politically charged “French Disko.” Watch closely and you might catch Sadier rolling her eyes.As the ’90s progressed, Stereolab traded some of their fuzz for more refined textures on albums like  and . Recreating the sound live sometimes required extra hands. A string quartet as well as their frequent collaborator, the High Llamas’ Sean O’Hagan, join the groop for a confident and beautiful rendition of “Cybele’s Reverie” on “Jools Holland.” Hansen and Sadier’s vocals sparkle while the dreamy string arrangement glides by like a gentle breeze. Even as Stereolab moved away from traditional rock vibes, the band remained a captivating live act with a healthy sense of adventure.If you’ve watched any of the above videos, you’ll know that the members of Stereolab weren’t exactly onstage dynamos, and preferred instead to let the music do the talking. But when they wanted to, they were certainly capable of transforming into a deeply funky party band. Check out this almost 10-minute “Metronomic Underground,” with an unstoppable groove punctuated by ecstatic guitar skronking from Gane. At the center of it all, Sadier and Hansen trade effortlessly cool vocal lines. Stereolab was dealt a cruel blow just two years after this clip was filmed, when Hansen was killed in a cycling accident. The band soldiered on through this (as well as Sadier and Gane’s breakup), but always with a crucial piece of its soul missing.“At the end of the band, Stereolab were as good as we ever were [onstage]—in fact much better than we were, very intense,” Gane told the Quietus in 2015. “I always judged it on intensity rather than playing well. From some point onwards, we never wavered.” For resounding proof of his statement, download NYC Taper’s stellar recording of a 2008 gig in New York, which took place shortly before the band went on hiatus. During a career-spanning set, Stereolab offer up a fantasia of rhythms and melodies that feels both freewheeling and focused. At the end of closing number “Jenny Ondioline,” Deerhunter’s Bradford Cox emerges with a wild keyboard part—a passing of the torch to one of the groop’s many disciples.",articles4,"['Gane', 'Duophonic', 'Katharine Gifford', 'Powered', 'Ramsay’s', 'Sadier’s', 'Deerhunter']"

Rutter, president of the Kennedy Center, said in a statement, according to . “For three decades, Dave has challenged us to see hot-button issues from his entirely original yet relatable perspective.”Matthew Winer, director of comedy and special programming at the Kennedy Center, told NPR, “Dave is one of the truly original voices in comedy—the definition of a creative artist.” He continued, “He’s a modern-day sociologist, skewering stereotypes, defying boundaries, and showing us that laughter can be a way to contextualize issues that we struggle to understand.”Dave Chappelle has won the last two Grammy Awards for Best Comedy Album.

"Michael Lang says former financial partner Dentsu Inc. is attempting to “suffocate and kill Woodstock”Woodstock 50 is scheduled to take place from August 16-18 in Watkins Glen, New York, but the festival is facing uncertainty after former backers Dentsu Inc. pulled financial support from the festival back last month. At the time, Dentsu claimed that the festival was canceled, prompting founder Michael Lang to insist that the event will still take place.Today, Lang sent a five-page letter to Dentsu (viewed by Pitchfork), which alleges that the former investors “illegally swept approximately $17 million from the festival bank account.” After claiming that the company was responsible for blocking ticket sales, Lang said that Dentsu suggested that performers, the venue, vendors, and others to cut ties with Lang.“We also have evidence that Dentsu representatives have gone so far as to say that should the talent back out of Woodstock, they would be seen favorably by Dentsu and that this could result in their performing the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where Dentsu is a major organizer,” Lang wrote. “In these actions too, Dentsu has acted not only without honor, but outside of the law.”In the letter, Lang once again insists that the festival will continue as planned and claims that organizers have found “renewed interest in financing.” He asks that Dentsu return the $17 million and stop interfering with the festival going forward. “It is one thing if your company, Dentsu, wanted to back out of its commitment to Woodstock because it would not make as much money as it had hoped, but to try to suffocate and kill Woodstock so that we could not have a festival for our Golden Anniversary without you is puzzling for any company, let alone one that claims reform,” Lang wrote.Woodstock 50’s lineup includes JAY-Z, the Killers, Dead & Company, Chance the Rapper, Miley Cyrus, the Raconteurs, and more.

"“Linda could literally sing anything.” This ringing endorsement comes from none other than Dolly Parton, just one of the famous fans offering a reverent word in Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman’s new documentary, . It’s no empty compliment from an old friend: Ronstadt dabbled in—and more or less mastered—all kinds of styles, from country to rock to jazz standards to opera to traditional Mexican music. Linda Ronstadt really  sing anything.So why, despite all her multi-platinum records, has she remained critically underrated? It was only after Ronstadt’s Parkinson’s diagnosis in December 2012 that she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, a biased barometer of one’s importance to be sure, but an institution she should have belonged to a lot sooner. This November marks 10 years since Ronstadt, now 72, gave her final concert—her illness has rendered her unable to sing properly—but in the absence of her voice, the documentary aims to reclaim Ronstadt’s rightful position as one of the most gifted vocalists of our time. Based on her 2013 book, , and filled with flattering anecdotes from well-known collaborators, the film is stitched together with archival performance footage that’s worth seeing any day. Mostly,  is a welcome reminder of Ronstadt’s can-do-anything spirit.Ronstadt had this gift of breathing new life into other people’s songs. Her breakout arrived, in 1967, in the form of a cover: Her band, the Stone Poneys, gender-flipped the monogamy-deflecting “Different Drum,” first recorded by the Greenbriar Boys. The notes sound fuller and the words carry more emotional weight on Ronstadt’s version, leaving the listener pining even as she states upfront, “I’m not in the market for a boy who wants to love only me.” In the documentary, Dolly attests that when you love a song as much as Linda loved those she reinterpreted, they basically become your own. When you hear an already familiar tune sung by Ronstadt, it’s as if you’re hearing it for the first time. On “Blue Bayou,” one of her most famous covers, she wrings out a more lovelorn performance than even Roy Orbison could. When she dives into the chorus, her voice lifts up out of the darkness like a sudden revelation. She never quivers, but the heart of the listener does.Ronstadt’s penchant for covers is well known; less obvious to younger generations is the fact that she was a bit of a shape-shifter. As the doc chronicles, she developed a diverse musical palate through family members: her love of folk and country came from her sister, while her mother’s preference for Gilbert and Sullivan informed her participation in the stage and screen revivals of  during the early 1980s. Her Hispanic heritage on her dad’s side was rarely acknowledged until she decided to revisit the music of her childhood in 1987, with a mariachi album called . It’s also fascinating to see how she came up in the Laurel Canyon folk-rock scene of L.A. in the late ’60s and early ’70s, opening for people like Neil Young.Ronstadt was among these so-called musical geniuses, but she found herself constantly needing to prove herself, or being contextualized by her gender. She was misconstrued by the public and the press as someone who repackaged songs by men with her dreamy eyes, pouty lips, and perfectly shaggy bangs. Even as she was rising to fame, Ronstadt said she could sense that her touring band—comprised of all men—found it significantly less cool to back a woman singer. In fact, one of her first backing bands went off and formed the Eagles, gaining greater acclaim in just a few years’ time.She could be confident and stubborn, pushing back when warned about the consequences of her career choices, but she was also humble and often insecure. A few times in , she admits faults in her vision. She initially thought the jangly instrumentals on “Different Drum” didn’t work and that “You’re No Good” sounded too much like a Beatles song, but both went on to be crucial hits for her. Ronstadt was, according to producer Peter Asher, “confident about her ideas, not about her singing”—perhaps a surprise, given just how beautifully self-assured her performances were. If she saw people whispering during her shows, she’d assume the worst: that they were critiquing her voice.Being the only woman in the room in so many situations also brought on a different kind of self-doubt. In a voiceover during the film, Ronstadt recalls first encountering Emmylou Harris and becoming struck with envy because she was another brown-haired, bright-eyed singer with a country flair. Ronstadt decided to befriend, rather than belittle, and became one of Harris’ biggest supporters. They would, of course, go on to collaborate with Dolly Parton on the legendary  albums, forming what was one of the first all-female supergroups. Ronstadt was a woman who supported other women, even when the industry lent such little room for them to succeed. She was un-diva-like, happy to sing backup harmony for Parton and simply share the stage with her personal idols. There was one thing Ronstadt was unrelenting about, though, and it was her desire to freely explore whatever genres she pleased, be it straight-up country with her girls or mariachi  with her family.It is the latter style of music that she still gravitates toward during private performances. The film ends on this aching note: a small living room gathering of Ronstadt and her relatives. She sings softly, shakily, and then clarifies, “This isn’t really singing.” Though the moment is as graceful as it can be, there’s something so sad about it because we know what Ronstadt was capable of in her prime. That is what makes  useful as a documentary: It collects a wealth of artifacts that will help us to never forget just that.",articles4,"['’s Parkinson’s', 'Stone Poneys', 'Neil Young', 'Dolly Parton']"

"The case, in which a filmmaker claimed the Duffer Brothers stole an idea he pitched them, was scheduled to go to trial this weekThe plagiarism lawsuit against the creators of “Stranger Things” is going to be dismissed, Deadline reports. Filmmaker Charlie Kessler had previously claimed in a lawsuit that series creators Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer took a central plot point for “Stranger Things” from his short film . Now, Kessler has said that he has filed a request for the suit’s dismissal. The case was scheduled to go to trial this week.When contacted by Pitchfork, a lawyer for Charlie Kessler shared the following statement:Charlie Kessler filed a request for dismissal with prejudice of this
matter and said: “After hearing the deposition testimony this week of
the legal expert I hired, it is now apparent to me that, whatever I
may have believed in the past, my work had nothing to do with the
creation of ‘Stranger Things.’ Documents from 2010 and 2013 prove that
the Duffers independently created their show. As a result, I have
withdrawn my claim and I will be making no further comment on this
matter.”In addition, Netflix shared the following statement with Pitchfork:We are glad to be able to put this baseless lawsuit behind us. As we
have said all along, “Stranger Things” is a ground-breaking original
creation by The Duffer Brothers. We are proud of this show and of our
friends Matt and Ross, whose artistic vision gave life to “Stranger
Things,” and whose passion, imagination and relentless hard work
alongside our talented cast and crew made it a wildly successful,
award-winning series beloved by viewers around the world.In his original lawsuit, Charlie Kessler claimed that he and his agents pitched a -inspired series to the Matt and Ross Duffer, who apparently did not express interest in his idea. A lawyer for the Duffer Brothers later claimed that his clients did not “manifest any intent to enter into a binding agreement” with Kessler and also called Kessler’s claims “meritless.”Read “The ‘Stranger Things’ Rip-Off Lawsuit Could Set a Perilous Precedent” on the Pitch.",articles4,"['Deadline', 'The Duffer Brothers']"

"“Attendees are encouraged to bring flowers for the shrine,” read the ticketing page for “Devotional Sound,” a performance presented Thursday in New York by the transgressive British fashion designer Grace Wales Bonner. Inspired by Bonner’s exploration of black mysticism in her recent art exhibit , the event’s lineup presented a hand-picked but widespread survey of spirituality across various genres. Through their sets, Solange, Laraaji, Standing on the Corner, and Gil Scott-Heron collaborator Brian Jackson each presented ideas about ritual, religion, and community.An eclectic crowd consisting of Solange devotees, artists within the singer’s own orbit (Dev Hynes, Moses Sumney), neon-haired youths, and folks from the fashion world (like designer Telfar Clemens) all lined up around Saint Peter’s, a progressive Evangelical Lutheran church in Manhattan that moonlights as a jazz venue. With Solange’s new album, , coalescing around themes related to both Eastern and black spirituality, “Devotional Sound” seemed the ideal venue in some ways for her to premiere the songs live. But the event was not designed to be a Solange concert. Her performance was scheduled in the middle of the program, which allotted an equal amount of time for each set. In the age of celebrity worship, the audience seemed determined to give all their energy to Solange, instead of focusing their attention inward or on the other artists.A bustling crowd filed into the small auditorium, with some attendees dropping off flowers on the orange shrine where the new age musician (and longtime student of Hindu spirituality) Laraaji would perform. The crowd seemed mismatched to the reverantial setting: I overheard two British guys loudly asking, “How do you spell Flo Rida?”; a lumbering Australian man stepped  the cushion-lined pews and literally walked over me to reach the next row. Once everyone was packed in, Laraaji began bowing his zither and a warm drone sound vibrated through the room. His rendition of the spiritual “This Little Light of Mine” weaved in some of his spoken-word musings: “Bring forth your clearest focus, here, now,” he hummed into the microphone. A few people really got into it—like the bald dude sprawled out on the floor, eyes closed and arms outstretched—but not everyone seemed swayed by Laraaji’s gentle guidance; some placed that focus on scrolling through their Twitter timelines. But in a rare moment of true communion, Laraaji instructed everyone to put one hand on their heart and the other on their abdomen, take a deep breath, and let out a “comfortable laugh.” The room filled with the sound of , joy reverberating from the angular church walls.When it was time for Solange to perform, the audience’s highest focus was finally brought forward. (Even Wales Bonner perched up on the staircase to get a good view.) Launching into  for the first time live, Solange and her band stretched out opening track “Things I Imagined” with new arrangements that highlighted harmonized riffs and free-jazz horn noodling. When she did her  song “Rise,” she motioned for everyone to get up, like she was a worship leader—and unsurprisingly, everyone did. She dropped it low to the gunshot beats of “Way to the Show” and people hollered. When her set ended, about a third of the audience started filing out hurriedly, completely ignoring the thrilling jazz flute solo from composer Brian Jackson that immediately followed.Other moments in the program were intended to memorialize trailblazing black artists. Jackson took to the piano to play “A Toast to the People” and “Winter in America,” two protest songs he had written with Gil Scott-Heron, while the sister of the late artist Terry Adkins read a heartfelt poem in his honor. This sense of tribute carried over to the show’s closing set from Standing on the Corner. The experimental hip-hop group set up an ad-hoc shrine and microphone booth, the latter decorated with a tapestry of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and a wind chime adorned with an angelic photo of Nipsey Hussle. The remaining audience members head-nodded to the elaborate jazz orchestrations of the eight-person collective, led by Gio Escobar via his own kind of madman sign language. Each player seemed to improvise while still locked into a basic groove. It was another form of communion: simultaneously free and yet connected. When I asked Laraaji what he thought of Standing on the Corner afterwards, he summed it up aptly in just a word: “liberated.”By the end of the night, it became clear that Wales Bonner was trying to do a bit of conducting herself. Though she never once addressed the crowd, she placed different performances side by side in a stunning church and let the audience discover the intertextual connections on their own—assuming they were approaching the sets that way. For me, “Devotional Sound” was packed with so many different concepts, movements, and approaches to music, it never became a space for measured reflection. Other attendees who didn’t try to ponder every part of the program found solace in Solange’s presence. They expressed their devotion to  sound, at least.",articles4,"['Thursday', 'Bonner’s', 'Gil Scott', 'Solange', 'Eastern', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Laraaji', 'Solange', 'Solange', 'Brian Jackson', 'Gil Scott']"

"If there were actually a bride on Vampire Weekend’s new album Father of the Bride, it would probably be Danielle Haim. The singer, guitarist, and middle child of indie rock sister trio Haim joins Ezra Koenig for three songs on his band’s fourth record. She’s a surprising yet familiar presence: surprising because she’s the first person other than Koenig to sing lead across a Vampire Weekend album, familiar since the rueful, sunlit nostalgia of  isn’t so far from the Haim sisters’ moody, California-inspired pop.“I know the reason why you think I oughta stay/Funny how you’re telling me on my wedding day,” Haim sings on album opener “Hold You Now,” the first of three country-tinged duets that trace a faltering relationship from doubt to renewed commitment. Together, the songs offer an emotional link across a sprawling album—a spiritual cushion against recurring disillusionments, a modern take on Loretta Lynn and Conway Twitty duets.Like 2013’s , the bulk of  was produced with Ariel Rechtshaid, the celebrated indie and pop producer who’s also Haim’s live-in romantic partner. “There were always people coming in and out [of Rechtshaid’s home studio],” says Haim. “Ezra was very into collaboration and asking for people’s ideas.” The album also incorporates the mellow funk of fellow Californian Steve Lacy, who sings on “Sunflower” and “Flower Moon,” and producer credits for DJ Dahi and BloodPop.Calling during a car ride with sisters Este and Alana, Danielle spoke about her first run-in with Koenig, the organic studio process for , and how she recently found herself serenading Jenny Lewis with Rilo Kiley songs.Pitchfork: How did you get involved with ?Danielle Haim: I’ve known Ezra for so long. I actually met him when I was on tour with Julian Casablancas in 2010, I think the festival was Super Bock Super Rock in Portugal. I was a big fan, so I remember coming up to them backstage being like, “Hi! So nice to meet you”—and they were super nice. Through the years we’ve run into each other. Of course, Ariel helped produce their last album, and Ariel’s my partner, so that made us closer. When [Ezra] started talking about his new album, he showed me, I think it was, “Hold You Now.” He was like, “Maybe it should be like a duet,” and I was like, “Oh my god, anything I can help with, I’m so down.” That was the first song we officially started working together on.It feels like you’re not just a voice on this album, you’re a little more like a character. Could you talk about how you took on this role?I don’t personally see it that way. [Ezra] was always harkening back to these old songs that he loved growing up—duets between a male and a female. We wanted to capture that same spark. But it was such an off-the-cuff, loose thing. They were working a lot at my house, actually. Ariel has a studio there, and I would come in to say what up, and Ezra would be like, “Hey, listen to what I wrote, do you want to put some harmonies on it?”I did not realize they were working at your house. What’s the vibe in there? Were you doing anything special, hosting-wise?No. I wish I was more like that, like, “Hey, do you want anything to eat?” I wasn’t really a great host. When Ariel and Ezra start working, they’re in the zone. I never really wanted to bother them. It’s not  my house—there’s a separate studio, it’s not like it’s in my living room so I wake up and I’m right there []. But it was easy—if I was like hearing something cool, I’d be like, “Whoa, this sounds dope.”How do you feel about the album? Do you have favorite songs?I’ll never forget hearing “Sunflower.” I’m such a huge Steve Lacy fan, and I’m so glad that they kind of came out with that one out the gate, ’cause I think it’s a good representation of the album. And obviously I play guitar, so it’s just fun to hear all the little guitar parts and the noodling. It’s cool to hear so much guitar on a Vampire Weekend record.What else have you been listening to lately?Speaking of Steve Lacy, I like the new Steve Lacy song. I am still listening to the Internet record a lot—I guess it’s not new anymore. I’m excited that Soccer Mommy is going to play Red Rocks with Vampire Weekend, that’s going to be cool. I’m a big fan of her, she’s fucking awesome. Rosalía was amazing at Coachella. I love the new Weyes Blood record, I think she’s incredibly talented. The new Jenny Lewis record’s great.You were part of Jenny Lewis’ album rollout, too.Oh yeah! I did that  thing [a live listening party/variety show].Did you know everyone there already?Yeah. Jenny took me on the road [with her band] when I was literally like 19. I was working at a clothing store and I happened to meet her. I’ve known her for so long and she’s been the best support for me—she always believes in me.I don’t think she knew until recently that I was a huge Rilo Kiley fan, because I don’t think I told her []. But my sisters and I would all go to Rilo Kiley concerts at Sunset Junction Fest in L.A. It was after my birthday and we were all kind of drunk and we came over to my house. There was a guitar, and I don’t know how it happened, but I ended up singing Jenny Lewis karaoke to Jenny Lewis.You were singing her own song to her? What song?Oh my god. “With Arms Outstretched” and then I ended up doing “The Good That Won’t Come Out.” That’s when she asked me [to join the  listening party], right after my birthday. Like, “Hey, it dawned on me that you could maybe…” I was a little embarrassed afterwards, but I’ve been such a huge fan of hers forever.Do you have any other dream collaborations you’d like to check off your list?Is it like a dead or alive situation? We just sang with Maya Rudolph—she has a band called Princess, which is a Prince cover band. Prince would’ve been the ultimate collab. It’s never gonna happen, unfortunately. But it’s fun to sing his songs.You played with Vampire Weekend at Fuji Rock Festival last year. Do you have any plans to join them on their upcoming tour?There’s nothing on the schedule yet, but Ezra knows I’m down. We’re working on new music right now so we’re kind of busy in the studio, but I’ll definitely drop by.",articles4,"['Vampire Weekend', 'Haim', 'Ezra Koenig', 'Koenig', 'Vampire Weekend', 'Ariel Rechtshaid', 'Haim’s', 'Rechtshaid’s', 'Haim', 'Steve Lacy', 'Danielle', 'Koenig', 'Rilo Kiley', 'Julian Casablancas', '!

A sample of Emma González, survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, opens the song: “[They say] us kids don't know what we're talking about, that we're too young to understand how the government works. We call BS.”In a statement, Madonna says, “I wrote ‘I Rise’ as a way of giving a voice to all marginalized people who feel they don’t have the opportunity to speak their mind. This year is the 50th anniversary of Pride and I hope this song encourages all individuals to be who they are, to speak their minds and to love themselves.”Madonna’s new album arrives June 14.

"In early April, as word spread that Red Bull Music Academy was shutting down after more than two decades, musicians and journalists found themselves in a curious position: mourning the loss of an energy drink sponsorship. Flying Lotus, an alumnus of the 2006 academy in Melbourne, tweeted his love to all involved. Hudson Mohawke, who attended the 2007 academy in Toronto, eulogized “maybe the only truly successful example of a corporate sponsored music/culture partnership.” Staunchly independent music website The Quietus even called RBMA “an antidote to the depersonalized aggregation of music and culture embodied by Spotify, YouTube, and others.” In the commercial desert that is underground music, somehow it was caffeinated sugar water that helped sustain an ecosystem.RBMA’s demise seems to reflect the reality of corporate patronage in today’s flailing music industry. But the impressive legacy of this traveling music workshop/festival/conference demonstrates what a difference corporate largesse can make when the right people are given the reins. It is those people—Yadastar, the German marketing and consulting firm that effectively built RBMA—that Red Bull is parting ways with come Halloween. Together under the RBMA banner, the two companies have flown out young artists, producers, and DJs to a different city around the world almost every year since 1998. Yadastar’s work for Red Bull also includes a longform editorial website, the RBMA Daily, and a genre-defying online radio station, Red Bull Radio (formerly RBMA Radio), which regularly hosts artist-helmed programs. Guided by Yadastar, Red Bull’s sponsorship has nurtured the creative community with an artistic fearlessness that branding tie-ins almost always lack. From the outside, it has been a nice surprise to see the partnership flourish.To be clear, Red Bull isn’t pulling out of the music industry altogether. In an April 3rd statement, the Austrian company suggested it would be continuing to “support promising and cutting-edge artists,” but through its satellite offices in individual countries instead of from its global headquarters. According to Resident Advisor, the Red Bull Music division, which wasn’t affiliated with Yadastar, will continue. The company’s music publishing arm, part of the Red Bull Media House, is currently hiring for a West Coast A&R director. And Red Bull Records, which leans a bit more mainstream than RBMA’s adventurous endeavors, is still kicking as well. The multi-city Red Bull Music Festival exists independently of RBMA, and while this year’s New York incarnation is currently underway, there’s no official word on what the future holds for the well-regarded event series.It’s unclear how many people will lose their jobs as a result of the breakup, or what will happen to RBMA’s invaluable archives. (As Hua Hsu recently wrote in , “The closing was a reminder that much of contemporary culture is produced by companies that don’t see themselves as archivists, or as custodians for the future.”) A Red Bull spokesperson declined to comment to Pitchfork; Yadastar directed us to its earlier statement, which says that the decision to part ways was mutual. Numerous people I contacted who were familiar with the inner workings of Yadastar and RBMA declined to comment on the record.One source familiar with the situation told me that Red Bull Radio asked for a budget increase and Red Bull responded by cutting the funding. “It obviously didn’t make any money,” this person said. According to the source, job losses are expected to extend beyond just Yadastar, to Red Bull corporate employees who had worked as liaisons with Red Bull Radio.A single department asking for more money is an incidental anecdote in the larger scheme of things, of course. The simplest explanation as to why RBMA would close up shop now has to do with the type of work, and the timing of internal sea changes. Chief marketing officers average less than four years on the job, and music branding initiatives rarely last much longer. Comparatively, the 21-year relationship between Red Bull and Yadastar was exceptionally long in the tooth, not to mention elaborate. Like anything, it was going to end eventually.There’s also a whole corporate line of reasoning that’s a bit more specific. Red Bull boss Dietrich Mateschitz will turn 75 on May 20. In a common predicament for companies led by strong-willed founders, he has no obvious successor; his only child, Mark Mateschitz, is still in his mid-20s. Given the potential for a shakeup at the privately held company, it would make sense if internal contenders for the top job were trying to impress by trimming some fat from the balance sheet. That’s especially true when considering that mounting public health concerns threaten to transform sugary drinks, particularly energy drinks, into the next tobacco. Red Bull might not be able to count on $7 billion in annual sales forever.When looking for cost-cutting areas at Red Bull, pulling back from music has some logic to it, as painful as that is to say. The company inspired envy on Madison Avenue for its success with content marketing, the now-commonplace practice of creating storytelling materials—not ads—that make a brand more attractive to consumers. As embedded as RBMA became in the minds of some musicians and music lovers, the story to tell around music is necessarily more nuanced and less results-oriented than that of Red Bull’s better-known area of content marketing: sports teams and events. Ultimately, it’s hard for executives to know how to measure the return on investment from such great RBMA moments as the inventor of the Moog synth giving a lecture in South Africa, Derrick May guiding a younger techno producer in Belgium, or Brian Eno presenting a visual arts piece in Manhattan.In 2017, in a previously unpublished interview for a story about how music is funded around the world, Yadastar co-founder Many Ameri told me a couple of ways he hoped RBMA would leave something sustainable behind. One part was physical—stepping in and building studios around the world, something that he felt local creative scenes would be able to use. (These studios still exist, but it is unclear what will happen to them down the line.) The other part was more about building a lasting network among different artists. “When you’re looking at the academy itself, the intention is basically fostering creativity,” he said. “When we leave, there is a new structure that has grown from these people collaborating that would usually not work together. And they continue doing that afterwards.”Take that in for a second. Ameri, a branding consultant for a global corporation, was thinking aloud about what RBMA artists would do once they were no longer hosted by the company’s sponsorship. And quite often, RBMA made a point of applying that degree of thoughtfulness to music that otherwise would not have broken through to wider audiences, or artists from marginalized communities worldwide. “The music narrative space that they created did not exist before,” says Piotr Orlov, a Pitchfork contributor who was one of the local producers for the 2013 New York City academy. “And if people say it only existed to sell energy drinks, and nothing more came out of that, I would say that is probably very short-sighted.”Perhaps the greatest lesson from RBMA is that, if a huge corporation is willing to spend the money, it might as well be used to elevate the underground. That doesn’t mean Colonel Sanders at Ultra, or a Lady Gaga gig in a gigantic Doritos vending machine. It means focusing on stories that aren’t often told, artists that aren’t often presented, concepts that are complicated or challenging to implement. “If you just reproduce what the music world out there can do by itself, there is no need for a brand to be involved in culture,” Yadastar’s Ameri told me in 2017. At a time when under-the-radar musicians are more concerned with mere survival than notions of selling out, will another company be willing to give them their wings?",articles4,"['Flying Lotus', 'Mohawke', 'RBMA’s', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull’s', 'Red Bull', 'RBMA’s', 'Numerous', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull', 'RBMA', 'Red Bull', 'Red Bull’s', 'RBMA', 'Brian Eno', 'RBMA', 'Piotr Orlov']"

"Listen to the track belowIn 2017, Detroit-based indie musician Stef Chura released , a collection of riffy noise-pop patched up with surf guitar and the odd smeary ballad. Perhaps most surprising was Chura’s voice, a worn-in twang or a fried-out warble that rarely seemed more than a moment away from swallowing itself. “They’ll Never,” the second single from her upcoming album for Saddle Creek, , opens with warm, fuzzy chords that are soon cut by her melancholy slackness. “Sorrow in your sigh/Forget you getting by,” she sings, voice snagging on the syllables until she begins to sound like Debbie Harry singing “getcha-getcha-getcha.”Chura was inspired, she says, by a dilapidated share house where she lived in Ypsilanti, Michigan: “No one cared enough to take care of it and no one cared enough to notice it and destroy it or hold the people who lived there accountable for keeping it up to code.” Even more than most houses, this one meant everything to the people living inside it and nothing to those on the outside. In the song’s final moments, Chura turns her opening line into a shout: “They’ll never tear this place apart,” she howls. It’s a benediction, a cry of frustration, or just one of life’s inevitabilities. You don’t have to tear up what’s falling down all by itself.",articles4,"['Stef Chura', 'Chura’s', 'Forget', 'Debbie Harry', 'Chura', 'They’ll']"

According to TMZ, which has video of the purported incident, the Migos rapper was at a Target in Sandy Springs, Georgia when a man (identified by TMZ as Junior Gibbons) filmed him and said, “What up, Offset?” Offset allegedly said, “Get the fuck out of my face,” and knocked the phone out of the man’s hand, causing it to break.Offset is reportedly facing a felony charge for damage to private property.

Below, check out the Hiver’s “Pert” from the mix. Plus, check out the album cover, which Peggy Gou says is a nod to her Korean heritage. She explained:I had the concept of this cover in my mind for a long time—as the
first Korean woman to contribute to the  series I wanted to
do something from my heritage, so I chose the tiger, which is very
important in Korean traditions and a metaphor for my personality. As
it is not humane to shoot with a real tiger, I and the photographer
Jonas Lindstroem used a library image to make a composite. The tiger
“disappears” when you turn to the inside-cover photo, to highlight
that these beautiful animals are already extinct in my home country
and in danger of disappearing from our world entirely.Earlier this year, Peggy Gou launched her own label, Gudu. She also shared the two-song  EP.Read about Peggy Gou on Pitchfork’s “The Best Electronic Music of 2018.”",articles4,"['Peggy Gou', 'Peggy Gou’s', 'Earlier']"

"Shareholders allege that Dolan’s pay is “excessive” and his job only “part time” due to how much he tours with his band JD & the Straight ShotJames Dolan, the executive chairman and CEO of Madison Square Garden Company, is staggeringly overpaid, a new lawsuit brought by shareholders of the sports and entertainment company claims. As head of MSG, which owns its namesake arena in addition to Radio City Music Hall, the New York Knicks, the Boston Calling Music Festival, and several other venues and franchises, Dolan allegedly earns far more than others in his industry, according to the complaint. Shareholders claim that Dolan “works at MSG only part time,” with much of his focus going toward touring and recording as the frontman and guitarist for his band JD & the Straight Shot.In a statement, MSG told the  news service , which first reported the news, “This lawsuit amounts to nothing more than corporate harassment. The company stands by its policies and practices.” Update (5/6/19): In a statement to Pitchfork, an MSG spokesperson said, “The single plaintiff in this suit—Shelby Willcox and the Norton C. Willcox Testamentary Trust—was found by a firm, Purcell Julie & Lefkowitz LLP, that sends out press releases fishing for clients. Under Jim’s leadership, MSG has generated tremendous shareholder value, including a stock price return of nearly 40%, equivalent to a $2 billion increase in market cap, since he became CEO in November 2017. A substantial portion of Jim’s compensation are options that are priced at a significant premium—creating additional incentive for him to continue growing the company and creating value for shareholders.” (The shareholders’ lawyers have not responded to requests for comment.)Over the last three fiscal years, MSG paid Dolan $75.6 million, according to company filings. “By comparison, MSG’s peer companies paid their CEOs an average of $17 million for the same three-year period,” the complaint says. “The highest-paid peer CEO received $32.4 million, over $43 million less than James.” The lawsuit claims Dolan’s pay is “excessive” and “far from fair.”In a separate statement, the Dolan family—several of whom, as MSG board members, are named in the complaint—told  that “these [law] firms represent the worst in our legal system. They manufacture complaints and then advertise for clients, also known as trolling. Members of these firms tried the same tactic at Cablevision [where Dolan previously served as CEO]. They lost and will lose again. We look forward to fully litigating this matter to conclusion. We will never settle nor give in to this corporate extortion.” (In 2015, a Delaware judge dismissed a similar lawsuit at Cablevision.)In addition to Madison Square Garden and Radio City, MSG’s live music venues include the Forum in Los Angeles, the Chicago Theatre, and the Las Vegas clubs TAO and Marquee.JD & the Straight Shot “travels and performs extensively domestically and Internationally,” according to the complaint. “In 2017, for example, the band performed 50 times in six countries and 41 U.S. cities, an increase from the 32 shows it performed in 2016. In late 2017, the band released its sixth album, and is in the process of recording a seventh.”The shareholder lawsuit was filed in late March in Delaware court. The complaint was brought by the Norton C.

Dark Morph is out May 10 via Krunk/The Vinyl Factory.

Von Hausswolff elaborated on their process in a statement:While we were on the boat I started to take the recordings, manipulate
them and mutate them into drones or other types of musical
functions—so we could use the sounds as instruments for building
compositions. We decided, “Let’s try not to have them sounding too
much like real sounds, let’s turn them into something else.” When I
had done some drones, some long tones out of a bird or something, I
gave it to Jónsi and he started to peel off certain types of melodious
things, and then play it to me. And then we started to just throw the
ball back and forth.Dark Morph will play a free show in Venice as part of the Biennale on May 10. Their music will also appear at the Venice Biennale as an audio gallery installation work at Ocean Space from May 7 to June 30.Later this year, Jónsi and Alex Somers will embark on a  anniversary tour.

"By: Anand HarshOff the beaten path but always on our minds, Bluetech has been steadily releasing new music that is inimitibly his. Evan Marc Bartholomew has delved even further into his modular analog synth setup and continued to flush out his own daring sound that is at once retro and futuristic. Between delicate, skittering melodies and brooding, ambient washes, Bluetech is creating entire worlds of sound that are uniquely his.Speaking of world-building, his latest album, Sci-Fi Lullabies, is a tribute to dreamed up, distant lands of his favorite science fiction authors. There are nods to the realms of Frank Herbert and Ursula K. Le Guin, and then there is “Embassytown,” the eponymous setting of the breakout 2011 novel. It's theme is lush and flowing, playful tune that is forever reimagining itself. It's indicative of the ebb and flow of the album as a whole, and fans who have been yearning to hear modular work at its best need look no further.It's out tomorrow, May 15th, both digitally and on vinyl: https://bluetech.fanlink.to/sci-fi-lullabies",articles15,[]

"By: Michelle GarganoCombining the eclectic minds of two musical creators like Amani Friend and Treavor Moontribe results in some magical production. Together, creating as the adored Desert Dwellers, this unique duo just celebrated 20 years together and dropped their new album, Breath, the culmination of three years of work, and more than 20 musicians.Never sticking to one genre, Desert Dwellers is known and loved for their contributions to psy bass, downtempo, tribal, and global bass. Throughout this ten-track release we are delighted with so many organic sounds.While this whole album is dripping in goodness, “Closed Eyes in a Dust Storm,” was my favorite track – elevating my senses and bringing my heart to a state of euphoria. Another stand out song is, At Last, Our Refuge, this dance-y track is melodic and tribalistic paired with a plethora of exotic instruments and beautiful vocals.Breath by Desert DwellersDesert Dwellers has a knack for turning up the temperature on any dance floor and connecting with their listeners on a deeper, spiritual level. My favorite part of their music is that each composition has a worldly vibe and greets our souls with a feeling of peace, and Breath certainly holds up to that reputation. And fans are connecting with it on a deep level, as we are learning that the album is about to enter the Billboard charts for best-selling electronic albums after dominating the Beatport chart and landing at #1 overall.We owe praises to artists like these who continue to celebrate and cultivate original, stand alone, captivating music over multiple decades. The best news about this release? You can hear this album in all of its glory, live, as Desert Dwellers gears up for a two-night heater at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado.Tonight, and tomorrow, they are sharing the bill with none other than the infamous Simon Posford for two nights of live Shpongle sets and here’s the kicker, a special set from the legendary Dave Tipper tonight and CloZee tomorrow.

"By: Anand HarshIt's hard to tell what's more perfect, man, this art or this flip.Aaron Triggs is back on his hip-hop slime game. Following up his latest studio efforts in The Psychic Staring Effect series, Bleep Bloop swings the pendulum back from more modular synth tinkering to straight up rap anarchy.Taking Vince Staples' “GTFOMD” and adding a signature big, brash, hard-edged drop, Bleep Bloop makes it his own. Triggs may love to get lost in the mess of mod cables, playing around with the classic acid aesthetic or getting sinisterly ambient, but he can never resist a tightly wound verse or a key rap hook.But this remix would be incomplete without some artwork from Triggs' go-to designer. Gary Paintin comes through with his hallmark pentocular look for Staples. The pair have joined forces officially for the inception and execution of their nascent Eat The Bomb label, which most recently sported a new Noer The Boy track.One of our signature ""gets"" for this year was snagging Bleep Bloop for The Untz Festival, which kicks off in exactly 2 weeks.

"Editor's Note:The Wobble Women series is back with more incredible women kicking ass behind the scenes in the bass music industry. If you have a suggestion of who we should profile next, please drop us a line at support@theuntz.com or post them up in The Untztoppable Facebook group.By: Heather HodderThe mission statement of legendary dubstep promoter Sub.mission is “Moving people through sound not hype.”So it’s no surprise that Nicole Cacciavillano, owner of one of Denver, Colorado’s most explosive new venues The Black Box; owner, talent buyer, and agent of Sub.mission, and SLUG WIFE manager, among others, is motivated by the music and the happiness new sounds brings to the people.Nicole C (as she prefers to go by) has always been highly motivated. Growing up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she enjoyed playing team sports, which led to her coaching and to this day, she coaches girls’ sports teams. Before entering the music industry, Nicole C was a teacher; it seems as if she was destined to motivate and lead others.“What motivates me is being at a show; I’m a people watcher,” said Nicole C, “I'm always trying to collect data on how things can be better or more meaningful or just an overall better experience. The one thing that motivates me more than anything else is just watching the look on someone's face when they are just ‘in that moment' of the music and the sound system and just their vibe...watching that transformation of all that stress and emotion dissipate and just watching music heal them.”Sub.mission will be bringing that vibe and sound in just over a week to the attendees of The Untz Festival, where they will be hosting their own stage featuring many of their talented artists and remarkable sound system. Tickets for The Untz Festival, May 31-June 2, hosted at the Mariposa Fairgrounds in Mariposa, California are available here.It was not always easy for Nicole C, who moved to Colorado in 2005. She explained, “dubstep wasn't really anywhere in America at that time, so I thought that I would give it a try.” So she started small, taking over nights at a drum and bass club that let her do her own thing. “It was a probe into the bass scene to see what the reaction would be to dubstep. April 2007, Sub.mission threw their first proper event, and “Man, the rest was history,” recounted Nicole C.Creating her own events in a new genre came with many challenges that she crushed. “No one knew what dubstep was and no one knew why would be requesting to bring in a sound system, It was really tough in those first few years to find a spot that would allow you to do events the way you wanted them to,” notes Nicole C.These roadblocks didn’t stop Sub.mission. Starting from the ground up was hard, but extremely rewarding. “When I started, the dubstep scene [in Colorado] was very small and intimate and passionate and very music centric. As it grew between 2010-2012, corporations were just knocking at my door to take me out, book this, pulling me in a million directions and trying to get a piece of what I had created at that point; it was Sub.mission and it was cool because we had created our own little bubble and our own little scene. So no one could ever take that away,” explained Nicole C, adding “I noticed along time ago that this was now my job and no longer a hobby.”When Nicole C wants to think and plan, she has a couple spots to meditate on Sub.misssion’s future: “I really enjoy being at the Black Box when I’m alone. I don’t get a lot of time there by myself and I really like to walk around there to just suck in all of the vibes of what’s been happening. In addition to that, first and foremost, living in Colorado I have nature that’s surrounds me and there is really nothing more rejuvenating than taking a trip up to the mountains and just sitting there and thinking, surrounded by peace and calm.”Regarding gender issues in her industry, Nicole C admits she’s been very lucky. “I’ve never really run into any gender issues in the music industry. I think mostly for me it was because I started a genre in one of the few cities that kind of started it. I’m always doing something with integrity … and I’m not afraid to stick up for my team, or myself, in any way, shape or form. However, I do know those who do run into issues and I think first and foremost, the biggest piece of advice I could give them [women] is to establish their fucking boundaries, and to make sure that they are very clear with that and let people know you’re not here to take their shit, You’re hear to do a job,” said Nicole C, “As long as that’s the focus, then I hope that men, or whoever, women, other people in the industry, will respect that and see them for their hustle, not whatever their sex is.”Even with all of her accomplishments and admiration throughout the bass music industry, Nicole C stays humble. “I’m just a girl who likes good music, who loves good music and just like someone who just wants to continue to push the boundaries. I think ‘role model’ is a strong word... ultimately I think it's just so much more than me. While I might be the figurehead, I have such a massive team of people behind me…. it's just so much more than myself, having a team of people who care about things the way you do, is so much more empowering than even being called a ‘role model.’”“Ultimately when I got started, there weren't very many females; but the cool part about that was that every one of those women who were involved as a DJ or producer, they were killing the game. They definitely stood out. I don't think it's any secret that electronic music is a male-dominated genre, and I do think over the years that's kind of changing. Now as an agent, I am working with more female promoters and producers and that's been really cool to see,” said Nicole C, “There are more females that I don't think are intimidated anymore to get behind the deck and try to learn how to DJ, which is always great and there are even some females that are killing it with production. I'm not going to lie and say that I think that the amount of females is astounding, because it's not. I do think that there's so much more room for females to grow in this industry.”For more women to get involved in the bass music industry in leadership roles, Nicole C explains that, “I think ultimately it's just experience and getting involved, like women, we are known for our emotions, which is amazing. And I think a lot of times when you really get into the nitty gritty of the music industry, you realize that it's not always fun backstage running around, listening to your favorite music. There's so much more to hospitality and to the grind, that I think might deter some women because they essentially just want to listen to the music and have a good time, but I do feel the more festivals I've been working and things like that, it's giving them the experience.” adding that, “Women don't have to just be the hospitality coordinators at a festival, women are very capable of becoming stage managers and production managers and just running events in general.”  Continuing on that Nicole C said,” So hopefully just them getting the experience and being confident enough to be competent and assertive enough to get themselves into these different positions. I don't think men for the most part are holding it back or not hiring women because they're women; I think that right now it's been a male-dominated industry for so long that there are so many qualified men for the job. For a woman to come into that could be a little bit intimidating. But like I said, it's all about assertiveness and about letting people know that your skilled and getting your foot through the door.”  “I think my advice to women would be very similar to that. Yeah. I mean definitely kind of focus on what exactly it is that you want to do. If you're not sure what that is, then try to be an intern or help volunteer at festivals or music venues or whatever, to try to get a good idea of what it is that you want to do a little bit more specifically and then, just go for it. Don't let anything hold you back; get your way and just don't give up,” said Nicole C, “I do think that what's meant to be is what's meant to be and there are positions out there for anyone and everyone who want to be involved.”Leadership abilities and being highly motivated are attributes that Nicole C has had her entire life: “As a child I was this little bossy girl; Well maybe I wouldn't so bossy, but I was definitely always creative and definitely always a problem solver. So, no matter what the situation, I'd love to figure it out and try to just get over the hump, or elevate it to the next level. Even as a teenager, I was the same way. I always played sports and I was captain of the sports teams. And so it's just about motivating people and trying to be the best that you can be. But the crazy thing is that I never even imagined myself in the music industry ever. I actually knew I wanted to be a teacher since I was in kindergarten.”In Philadelphia, Nicole C taught middle school and a program for at-risk youth and students with behavioral problems. In Colorado she taught high school. Then, her music career kicked off and life changed: “honestly music just kicked off so much that I couldn't really bounce around anymore. I'd made the decision to step away from teaching and pursue just a sole career in music. At that point I was throwing events and at the agency; since then I've lived in the Black Box and who knows what comes next.”Nicole C has many memorable career moments, that happen continuously: “For me right now, with the agency, like my biggest moment right now, it's been like the last few years and those memories and moments, because for the first time in history of dubstep, everything is really coming together full circle. I was able to open a venue, the agency's really popping off with promoters around the country. You're really getting it and really open to the sound of music, so we're able to really start spreading things and sharing what we believe in and what we love with so many more people and that has been amazing. It's been an amazing year for us on the agency side and for me as a person who's been dedicating so much time and energy into this sound three years, to finally have it all come together. It's been real magical.” Nicole C also noted the five year anniversary party as a pinnacle moment in her career and still one of Sub.mission's biggest events to date. The night this interview was done, Sub.mission celebrated its 12th anniversary at the Black Box. The very first Sub.mission event was also meaningful to Nicole C, “It was an accomplishment, being able to love something and have people show up for it and show that they love it too is just something,” she remarked.Nicole C and Sub.mission have many upcoming events. “We just did a stage at One Vibration Festival and in June we are doing a stage at The Untz Festival; in September we are doing a boat party at the Outlook Festival,” said Nicole C. Sub.mission will also be doing events in Europe including in Bristol, U.K and working with SLUG WIFE. Working with “the SLUG WIFE guys was really fun and rejuvenating and motivating for me because that's given me the chance to really travel and help the mission, and ensure the vibe is being transferred appropriately.”   One thing that Nicole C wanted to talk about was how she transformed and took over The Black Box in Denver “The Black Box used to be a venue called Benders and it was actually the first place that let me bring in my own sound system and regularly throw shows there. So ironically, I now own that place. Everything has come full circle. That's really kind of my M.O. I just love music. I wait, I try to set everything up to the best of its ability and just stay true to what I believe in and let things take its course. And, I think that is what has helped me along this path because I don't allow the music industry to pressure me into making decisions or doing things that maybe I'm not feeling or right. I do think that that would be maybe some more advice to kind of give to people as well. There is a time to place for everything and I don't think forcing yourself in or on whatever is necessary because whatever you're meant to be doing is going to happen and eventually it's all just going to kind of come full circle and say, and that's just what my experience has been and it's been very rewarding, So it's like one of those things that I think is important to kind of get out there as well.”",articles15,"['Colorado’s', 'The Black Box', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', '“What', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Black Box', 'I’m', 'Nicole C', 'I’m', 'I’m', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'In Colorado', 'Black Box', '”Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Black Box', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'Nicole C', 'The Black Box']"

"By: Jonathan GrossIf you're a fan of this feed, you're well aware of European glitch god Halfred, but his interests and talents go way beyond the bass world. He has teamed up with fellow Italian producer, Lo.Renzo, for a bold new project, Jakare.The duo produces slow and tribal house with a South American flair. The multi-instrumentalists blend ancient instruments and sounds with the trendy new dance style that's already popping up around the world. As the name suggests, it's house vibes, but at a slightly reduced BPM. Jakare releases its debut EP, Apu, on Desert Dwellers' Desert Trax label at the end of this month. But you don't have to wait til then to get a taste.Today we premiere “Glass Temple,” a winding journey that contains such lush melodies and intricate percussion, but its flexible tempo makes it great for a night out on the town, or a reflective night in. We love how it works in so many settings. And the attention to detail from a noted psychedelic producer gets even more fine-tuned in a brand new style.Apu is available May 31st.",articles15,"['Today', 'Apu']"

But when he does, the entire bass community listens.When it was announced the Skope would be putting out an EP on the hottest label on the planet, SLUG WIFE, slimers the world over lost their collective minds. A DnB legend as Malux, Skope has been a frequent collaborator of Culprate and has showed up with regularity on the Inspected platforms, but as I mentioned, is pretty low key on the socials.Not anymore.The five-track explosion from Skope which covers neuro, halftime, and glitchier deep dubstep, is a surprise attack from a mercurial figure everyone looks to as a tastemaker.We were able to score the EP opener, “No0ne” through sheer annoyance (my specialty), and this track is just the tip of the studio effort. If there's a producer on the label with whom this track most closely aligns, it would be the clean, melodic waves of Seppa, but there is some Kursa-esque gritty neuro, and Reso-like halftime on this EP, so there's no question Skope is right at home with the SLUGs.Beneath is out June 4 on SLUG WIFE and you can pre-order now.",articles15,"['Malux', 'Culprate', 'Seppa', 'Beneath']"

"By: Anand HarshFew artists who futz around in the minutiae of modular synths keep abreast of contemporary rappers and vice versa, but Aaron Triggs contains multitudes.Swinging the pendulum all the way back from his patch cable precision of The Psychic Staring Effect and its accompanying modular rig tour, Bleep Bloop in the past week has dropped two hard-nosed remixes of Vince Staples and now Smokepurpp.Taking on Smokepurpp and Xavier Wulf's “Fuck A Swisher,” Triggs transforms the blunt snob anthem in a slime punk roller coaster, first distorting the everloving shit out of Lil Water, then vocoding him into robotic oblivion, and finally venturing into a wild tech house breakdown. Shit's bananas. But no one can quite copy his aesthetic. An aesthetic brought to life visually by Gary Paintin, who gives Purpp the pentocular makeover.With any luck, Bleep Bloop will drop “FUKASWISHER” next weekend at The Untz Festival in Mariposa, California. He takes the main stage on Sunday, June 2 at 9:00pm directly after the SLUG WIFE Takeover.

"By: Anand HarshWhen it was announced just a couple of short weeks ago that New Zealand dubstep legends TRUTH would be releasing a surprise EP on Liquid Stranger's freeform bass label Wakaan, the internet exploded—and rightfully so. Though Dre Fernandez and Tristan Roake have appeared on Martin Stääf's label before, as part of the Space Jesus-curated CONVOY compilation, this is the first singular TRUTH studio effort to land on the label, and fans are notably excited.The Unexpected EP, as it aptly has been dubbed, is much heavier than the traditional, deeper fare of the dubstep duo. Today's premiere, “Creatures,” is also the most experimental of the four tracks on the EP, as befits its Wakaan home and the rabid obsession the label's fan base has with bass music that is off-the-beaten path. The sharp, arpeggiated synth stabs of the hook contain the controlled chaos that Wkaan's acolytes desire. The whole four-track pack is not only perfectly at home on the label, but thankfully lives up and even exceeds the high expectations fans will have of these two brands aligning.Pre-save The Unexpected EP from Wakaan",articles15,"['TRUTH', 'Today']"
" Just over two months until takeoff… Let It Roll have announced full details for this summer’s event.Taking place August 1 – 3, Milovice airfield, Czechia: More names have been added to the already massive line-up: Holotrope, HumaNature, Hybris, Chris.Su, Matzet, Ripple, Subtension, Symplex, The Prophecy, Tom Small and Trilo have been added to the line-up as well as whole troop of fast-rising Czech talent.They’ll be joining the likes of Chase & Status, Pendulum, Andy C, Noisia, Camo & Krooked, High Contrast, Sub Focus, Wilkinson, Dimension, Black Sun Empire, Current Value, DJ Marky, Flava D, A.M.C, Lenzman, DJ Friction, Matrix & Futurebound, Breakage, Dirtyphonics, Turno, Kyrist, London Elektricity, Benny L, Macky Gee, The Prototypes and hundreds more of drum & bass’s finestThe festival’s famous bus parties have also been confirmed. Renowned for their intensity, Let It Roll’s Mad Max-level post-apocalyptic 16-wheelers return for a series of 10 parties throughout the weekend.Compressed chaos in a heavily modified public transport capsule, the bus parties are guaranteed sell-outs. This year’s bus conductor rollcall is one of the strongest the festival has ever had and covers every base as parties will be hosted by Teddy Killerz & Gydra, Koven & Muzzy, Zombie Cats & Abis, Fourward & Friends, Killbox, The Prototypes, James Marvel & Ripple, Benny L & Shimon & Trimer, Rene Lavice & TC and Hybrid Minds.The festival has confirmed the new stage concepts for the weekend, too. Complementing the event’s ongoing opening show narrative, many of the raving areas have been updated: The epic main stage will be a vast ark-style shuttle entitled The Mothership while the second main outdoor stage (previously called the Factory stage) has been drastically redeveloped and will be known as The Temple, a stage comprised of old outgrown robot casings. Elsewhere in Let It Roll’s unique environment there will be a new stage called Eve’s Garden, which is a more pastoral-themed space dedicated to deeper and liquid sounds. Other stages introduced last year such as The Portal and The Shredder will make a welcome return. The former an impressive intergalactic radial construction, the latter a space aged junk yard, both stages created once again emphasised Let It Roll’s unique theme and impressive levels of stage production and look set to be even larger and more spectacular.All this and loads more; Let It Roll 2019 looks set to be the Czech festival’s largest event to date.

"Sweet murderation; Yung Prolix steps up this month with his debut solo album Murder Mile.A beastly bloodthirsty brew frothing over with 15 seismic wounders: Murder Mile comprises some of the London-based artist’s most uncompromising fusions since he emerged in 2004 and consequently went to appear on the likes of Ram, Shogun, Cause 4 Concern, Commercial Suicide about 80 percent of the records Hype ever released on his sorely-missed Ganja-Tek imprint (to name a few)Released May 27 on Blackout, the album features collaborations with the likes of Black Sun Empire, Malux, Qemists, Coppa, DC Breaks and many more. It’s named after the area in which he lives, it’s unapologetic in its brazen brutalist designs, it’s not shy of a rock element or two and there’s even a cheeky nod towards to the jumpier side of the game. Heavy enough to keep you screwfacing all summer, it’s the sound of a man in his most high octane musical element. We called him up to see how it came to be. Fortunately there were no murders involved.Murder Mile! What a name for an album. So I’m guessing this is a reference to Hackney?Yeah it is. I grew up in Brighton but I’ve been living here for quite a while and I like the sound of it as an album title too. It’s always tough coming up with a name for any track but especially an album. I think people expect something bigger from an album, a concept or something more than just a random word or one of the tune titles. I wanted something to reflect where I was, the location, the vibes.The history too. Some of the original drum & bass DJs were born and raised in Hackney. Loads of raves and pirate stations there…Yeah there’s definitely an aspect of the music’s history in there too. You’re right, so many of those legendary DJs came from here and still live here.I read on your Facebook about a dismembered head being found near your studio. Any truth in that?Haha. Yeah that was in Haggerston – a mile away from where I live now.That’s very close to this office!It is. Right by the canal. That area used to be well dodgy.Is this the anger and darkness we can hear in your music? The grit and danger and stress of inner city life?Ha! Maybe a bit. It’s not like it was when it was actually called Murder Mile, I love living where I do. But I did get burgled while I was finishing this album and had my studio ransacked.Ah man…Yeah man. I nearly had my computer nicked too. They took my CDJs, my record player, my Flying V guitar which was my pride and joy and I’m still fuming about that and one of my keyboards. They tried to drag my computer out but I think it was too heavy.Lucky!Very lucky. I hadn’t backed up for months and I’d have lost a huge chunk of the album. Luckily the police investigated it and caught the guy.If that had been taken then how much work would you have lost?I’d have lost about six months of work on it I imagine but a lot of samples and things like that on there I hadn’t backed up so I’d have lost years of work. That would have been devastating. You back up project folders and song ideas but you don’t back up samples. Fortunately this didn’t happen though!Yeah man! So when did the album start to take shape? You actually mentioned wanting to start one on UKF two years ago…Yeah I did. So me and Shogun went our separate ways, I started on it and started looking for the right label to release it. Blackout were the obvious choice; they’re great guys and friends of mine, very fun to work with and the label suits my sound perfectly. Looking at the landscape, there aren’t that many labels doing this sound at the moment. It’s great to be involved with them; they’re very relaxed but very efficient.Sounds like most labels in The Netherlands!It does doesn’t it? It’s nice working with guys like that.It sounds like you were all having fun on Savages!Definitely. We went in on a different vibe there. It’s not strictly jump-up but there’s definitely a vibe of that to it. It was great to have the Virus Syndicate boys give it their own unique aggressive grimey edge, too. It’s a bit of an experiment, but it always goes down well every time I play it.That’s kinda the vibe of the album. Like Set Me Free is a few tunes all in one. That Concord Dawn style intro goes into a completely unexpected drop.Thanks. When I started working on it I thought about what I love about drum & bass, what I love to play, what I love making but I also wanted to have my musical influences in there and obviously rock has been a big thing for me for years so I wanted that on there and Renny Carroll smashed it with those vocals. There’s also Feel Alive, the track with Qemists, who are known for their fusion of drum & bass and rock which again I was super pleased with, also because they’re mates from growing up in Brighton.Great to hear the Qemists again. Unsung heroes of that mid/late 2000s rocky sound. Pendulum eclipsed everything but they did BITS. Are they still active?Yeah they’re doing loads of things behind the scenes and have different projects. We’ve been chatting about doing something for years and years and it took 10 years to get around to it but it’s one of my favourite tracks on the album.Awesome. It’s one of those collabs where you can hear all of your sounds. I imagine it’s hard to achieve that balance in a collaboration?Very true. You have some collaborations where it’s a bit of a tug of war where you’re both pulling in slightly different directions. You all have to make compromises along the way. But with this we all clicked and agreed with what we wanted, and Ollie nailed the vocals too. It all fell into place so nicely.Was that the same type of natural flow with DC Breaks on Beatdown?Yeah for sure. We’d worked together before on some things for Ram so we know how each other work and had a good communication process anyway. Dan lives over the other side of London to me so kinda relatively close. He came over a few times, Chris sent over some wicked sounds and that was a great collaboration. Very smooth and fun.IRL vibes!Definitely. I try to do things together in the same studio as much as possible as things get lost in translation online a lot. You or they can spend hours on something and send it over and it’s not the vibe the other one had in mind. Like I said, it can be a compromise. It’s much better to get on a vibe in person and work together and react to it together in the moment.Especially because it’s your debut solo album so it’s that much more personalYeah man. Obviously my first album was the collaboration album with Gridlok but with this one I wanted to pick some good friends and also work with artists who I really like or who I feel are hidden gems. Guys like Renny and Scarlet She Koro. She did the vocal on the collab with Malux who’s a producer I love and wanted to work with. I wanted to work with Dee Freer because I’ve loved her vocals for a long time. I spent a lot of time trawling online to find someone who’s not been rinsed by the drum & bass scene.Must be great to find a new talent. Ever been inspired to do a Calyx?Ha! I can croon along in the shower and I’m probably in tune but no that’s not for me. Maybe with enough vocoder and distortion but I’d rather leave that to the really talented singers. And MCs too… Coppa was a ‘must have’ on the album. He’s such a pro and we’ve done things together in the past and he’s just such a wicked guy to work with. He understands the process, he’s very responsive, he records things at a very high level in his studio, he doesn’t have an ego. Yeah, I can’t shout him enough.Not many MCs can work on music as busy as yoursTrue! Yeah there’s a lot of frequencies going on and fighting for attention and not a lot of space for the vocal but he always knows what to do. I think that’s the main challenge with my style of productions is working out how to get a vocal to work.Yeah I imagine. So when did you finish the album? When did you draw that line in the sand and send it to Blackout?Not long ago at all! We’d put out some of the singles and planned a few more but it was only a month ago when I sent over the final final final version and stopped tweaking hi-hats. I guess that’s not rare in the music game now. Things do move very quickly.It’s important to have that immediacyDefinitely and the game changes all the time. The dominant sound changes and what the new generation of fans are into. One minute everyone loves neuro, the next it’s jump up, the next rollers are a subgenreHa!You know what I mean? Now there’s a great wealth of minimal stuff coming, things are constantly changing so you’re more likely to sound relevant if the album is released as soon as it’s finished. Not that sounding relevant is the reason you write an album, but you want as many people to hear it. And from the perspective from fans it’s important to have it out quickly… They know something is coming out, they don’t want to wait six months or a year for it come out or they’ll get bored waiting. So that immediacy is important for everyone at the moment I think.Yeah man. So with that in mind I suspect you’ve already got your eyes on the next release after the album?I wish I could say I did! I’ve been taking a bit of a break, organising my studio and cleaning things up a bit and doing all the things I neglected during the album process. I’ve got a bunch of collaborations people have asked me about and remixes and things so yeah there’s stuff in the pipeline. There’s also Trendkill to take care of.Yeah what’s coming up there?The Clamps has just put out an EP which I’m very happy with. Opsen who was previously in Signs has just put out a release and we’ve got a special project to announce very soon too.Exciting. News?That’s all I can say for now sorry. Trust me, it’s awesome.

"Hot on the heels of her debut production – Lost & Found on Macky Gee’s Down 2 Earth – Mollie Collins strikes again this month her second single and her brand new label, Right Good Records.A plan she’s been hatching for a while now, but put on ice as she joined the ranks at Kiss FM last summer, Right Good will focus on championing new-gen talent, celebrate all forms of bass music and is already locked down with releases until Autumn. It kicked off with Mollie’s single Better On My Own with X Factor star / D&B head-in-disguise singer Bella Penfold. Here’s how it came about… And what’s coming up next.New label! How long have you been plotting this?I was thinking about it for a year or so but then the Kiss role came up so I thought I’d leave it for a bit and focus on that and develop the show. So, after a while of settling into that I got together with two other people – my brother Joe Collins and my mate Joe Semark – and we decided to launch it.Have you been stashing productions for it? Every time I’ve interviewed you we’ve spoken about productions but I know you’ve been keen to not rush that side of things…Yeah that’s true. I always said it happens when it happens and this year it has. My debut Lost & Found came out on Macky’s label earlier this year! That took the longest time to make. Ages to be honest. So that came out and Macky’s a good mate of mine and it was great to have that exposure as a producer. Then Better On My Own was ready to launch the label with. It came out the other week and now my next one is done as well. So yeah there’s been some stashing going on and we’ve got two releases a month lined up until September. Not just from me, obviously, but a few of the guys on the label who are really exciting me. A wicked range of up-and-comers. The next EP, which is out end of May, has been supported by Target on Radio1 and 1Xtra recently which has been cool.Who’s that?IN:FO. He’d sent me a few tunes and I picked two I really liked and signed them. There’s a tune called Babylon that’s been picking up some wicked support. That’s the one Target’s played. Randall, Serum and guys like that are supporting.Who else?Gino’s got some stuff coming out. D-Minus, Leaf, Jolliffe, Semark, Just Eden, Sudley. A lot of relatively fresh and new talent coming through who are all making sick music.You’ve been on that journey as an emerging artist, and still are, so it’s cool to support thatYeah exactly. I think the label game has changed a bit these days. You don’t actually need that exposure from a label to break through; you’d need a big label to push you. It’s more about the artist and the product.The label is there to encourage and guide thatYeah of course. It’s more about support and giving people opportunities.You mentioned Macky. Has he given you tips on running a label?Yeah he’s always really helpful. A.M.C was super helpful giving me advice. It’s great to have mates and support like that. Obviously Cygnus have been amazing, I thought it would be a lot harder to set up a label to be honest.Doing the Kiss show must have influenced how you approach the label?Yeah I think so. The label, like the show, there’s not one single subgenre we’re after. If it sounds good, it’s going on. A bit like my sets, too. It’s for the love of all styles. We’re going fully in.Sounds like you are with your productions. How do you end up working with an X Factor contestant?Bella’s cool! She got to the quarter finals, she stood out on the show and she’s so talented. But I was actually friends with her on Facebook for ages before. She’s been a fan of bass music for ages and asked if I was up for a collaboration years ago. At the time I said no because I wasn’t producing but when I started and knew we could do something I thought I’d hit her up and she was straight on it. Then I got Leah Guest in who wrote my last tune and we all got on it together.Ah sick, she’s a D&B fan anyway! Always the ones you least expect…Oh yeah totally, she was buzzing to be on the track. She’s a massive fan. She’s out raving a lot. She was wicked to work with too. We’ll definitely do more in the future.Awesome. So what’s coming next?Loads of stuff. Like I mentioned, it’s two releases a month all locked in till September and more being planned as we speak. Loads of sick tunes from the guys I mentioned before – D-Minus, Leaf, Jolliffe, Semark, Just Eden, Sudley – and also a remix EP of my single Better On My Own with Levela on the drum & bass remix then Shosh on a UKG remix, NuBass on a bassline vibe and Semark on a house vibe. We really want to push a much exciting music from as many talented new artists as possible. There’s no specific sound, just proper vibes in any style that inspire us.Nice. What else do we need to know right now?I need to shout out my brother Joe and my mate Joe who also own and run the label with me. My brother is doing the accounts and all the important paperwork and admin stuff, Joe, who is also known as the artist Semark, runs the label from a management capacity.Fam affair!Yeah it is man. I couldn’t do it on my own. I’m not really one for the more desk job / paperwork side of things, I just want to find and support the music.That’s a sign of a label that’s here to stay and not just run by an artist for vanity or because it’s the done thing…Yeah that’s exactly why I didn’t want to set up a label straight away. I wanted to be working with the right people and have something proper set up so it’s something worth supporting and worth paying attention to.Something Right Good?Ha! Yeah exactly. Stay tuned, there’s loads more to come…Follow Right Good Records: Soundcloud / FacebookFollow Mollie Collins: Soundcloud / Facebook",articles39,"['Earth – Mollie Collins', 'Autumn', 'Mollie’s', 'Bella Penfold', 'Here’s', 'Lost & Found', 'Macky’s', 'Macky’s', 'Who’s', 'Target’s', 'She’s', 'We’ll', 'Shosh', 'Semark', 'Semark', 'That’s']"
"Our UKF10 series continues with the synth-struck timeless 140 star-gazer Close from Dub Police OGs The Others and Subscape.Both acts bursting through during the same explosive dubstep era that inspired UKF 10 years ago, Anthony Subscape and Alex The Others have been friends for over 15 years and spent a huge chunk of their early careers on the same label, they even lived together at one point… Yet Close is their debut collaboration.It’s not likely to be their last, though. They’ve actually been dabbling in collabos for some time and have found their work together has also had a positive impact on their productions as solo artists. The release and support of Close, however, has given them what Alex describes as a “much needed kick in the arse” to release more. With both acts erring on the less-is-more approach to releases in recent years, this is great news for fans of their vibrant, rolling, versatile synth-soaked 140 styles. Here’s where they’re at… And a little nostalgia on how they got here for good measure.You two must go way back. But this is the first official collab…The Others: Yeah man, this is our very first release and we’ve known each other for 15 years.Subscape: We have been in the studio together before, but it never got released.The Others: Yeah very early on we wrote some bits that floated around on dub but never saw the light of day. The crazy thing is we actually used to live together.Subscape: Yeah, we had our studios right next to each other for over a year but never wrote any music together. We bounced ideas off each other and would regularly give feedback but that was better for us at the time as we developed as individual artists.The Others: Definitely. I think we’ve developed in similar ways and in similar directions in a way, so we’d often be each other’s first person to contact for feedback or to check an idea is heading in the right direction. So when you guys approached us to take part in the UKF10 series it seemed like a perfect fit.Subscape: A good fit with you guys too. We’ve had a lot of uploads and support on the channel so it’s wicked to be part of the 10 year celebrations. To do that with our first collaboration makes it even more special for us.Ah so our A&R kinda willed this into existence?The Others: We’d been in the studio together a few times so something would have come eventually, but no your man Sampo did give us a bit of a kick up the arse. We had a deadline to work with, rather than sitting in the studio bouncing things around but never actually finishing anything.Subscape: It was perfect timing. I had the intro as the bare bones of Close and I’d brought it to Alex to see what he thought about it. So we were beginning to work on it anyway. Then this opportunity came along. The tune had that kinda throwback vibe to it which fitted in with the music the channel made a name for itself with, but with elements of modern production.It treads that fine line between old and new vibes…The Others: It is a really fine line, you’re right. When something has that throwback vibe then you need to make sure it doesn’t turn into novelty or repeating something’s that been done before.Subscape: I also think it’s a good balance of our styles and represents what we both brought to the track as well, which has kept it from going more along the over-trodden nostalgia route.The Others: Very true. When we worked on it Anthony had one idea, which he just mentioned and I was working on a different idea myself which I couldn’t quite work out. We put both projects together to see if they worked and it became this very natural and a really interesting way to work.It sounds like there might be more?The Others: Yeah we’re getting in the habit of writing more stuff together. We should have done this years ago but it’s great it’s happened and it’s also spurring us on with our own individual tracks.Subscape: Definitely. When you’re working on your own you only have your own opinion to go by. You get so blinded by your own work and overthink things you can no longer hear if it’s good or bad in your head it sounds shit and you want to scrap it. So getting perspective from each other has been really inspiring for me on my own productions.The Others: Totally the same here!Subscape: And also sharing that history of coming through Dub Police. We go way back so it’s very easy to understand where we come from and what reference points we share.That was such a mad time for Dub Police. What are your crowning memories of that era?The Others: I joined around the same time Rusko did, so super early on and everything was just beginning to develop. The nights in Herbal we were doing around that time really summed that vibe up. That’s when we noticed the label developing a following, a crowd building, people taking notice and then the Fabric nights where things really kicked off.Subscape: Yeah Fabric for me was mental. It started in Room 3 and we smashed it so there was no room to move. Then Room 2 where the same thing happened. Then the Room 1 residency. Those nights were legendary.The Others: it’s mad looking back at the line-ups like Skream, Benga, Chase & Status, all sorts of people. There’s no way you’d get line-ups like them now! It’s weird, it feels like ages ago but in the scheme of things 10 years isn’t that long ago.That brings us nicely back to UKF10, this was all part of the sound and movement that inspired the channels…The Others: Yeah totally. In drum & bass as well you had guys like Sub Focus killing it. Looking back it was a mad point in the music where everything just went crazy for a while.Amen. You guys DJing much together?The Others: Yeah we’ve been playing back to back for years, we’re often on the same line-ups so we’ll both jump on together sometimes. We know each other’s sets and sounds pretty well so it’s easy to play together. Some back to backs don’t flow so easily but we get on so well. So I think we’ll play together but first and foremost we’ll get some music out there…Subscape: The aim is now to continue releasing music and performing at exciting key shows worldwide, we are not going to flood the market with Subscape & The Others b2b sets. We want to save them for special projects like this. I am currently working on doing a few exclusive b2b set this summer with Emalkay, too. I want to have fun and get back to when it was just about the music and vibes.Vibesy. This all sounds very positive chaps… Do you wish you did this years ago when you lived together?Subscape: Nah I can’t stand him haha. Yeah that would have been good but at the same time we were focusing on ourselves as artists. The label had some very strong characters and sounds, Caspa, Emalkay, Trolley Snatcha, Rusko. Being on the label with guys like that was very inspiring and made us focus on our own sounds.The Others: We all worked together in different ways then anyway; we’d be inspired by each other’s tracks and support each other and help each other out so it was a team effort back then making releases got over the line.

"Your all-time favourite drum & bass tunes? Pick five.This is our mission should we choose to accept it.It’s been set by Let It Roll in a quest to discover the 100 most popular and definitive tunes of all time in our genre… And it’s a mission especially worth accepting if you fancy a chance of winning tickets to the festival this year.Besides the devilish process of deducing your favourites down to a mere five, the mission is simple: visit the Top100DNB website and enter the tracks by June 10, then sit back and watch the entire online drum & bass community bicker about it for years to come (especially the fans who didn’t vote themselves)The rules are simple too; any tracks or remixes from any era and subgenre are eligible for votes just as long as they’ve been officially released. That’s literally it. Let It Roll will also pick 10 voters to win tickets and merchandise.Besides annual awards such as the Drum&BassArena Awards, which only asks the public for their favourite tune that year, a survey of this kind has never really happened in drum & bass. Certainly not at this scale by one of the biggest and most renowned event brands in the genre. The results are guaranteed to be interesting however they shape up.As the site states, Top100DNB is a quest to find “the ultimate drum & bass tune. The tune that captures the essence and unique magic of this genre like no other. The tune that categorically screams THIS IS DRUM & BASS MATE!”What are you waiting for mate? The Top100DNB will be announced at the festival between August 1 – 3 and the top 10 will be revealed with a unique audio / visual show on one of the mainstages. Enter your favourites in the Top100DNB Hall Of Fame before June 10.Full details on Let It Roll’s line-up announcementsFollow Let It Roll: Facebook / Twitter ",articles39,['Enter']
"Producers gotta produce, artists gotta art, writers gotta write… Creativity is not a 9-5, it’s not something you can shut away or switch off. It’s why artists make music in the first place and is much more important than any of the many end benefits of the music; the success, shows or the mad fact that you’ve stirred emotions in total strangers.It’s a driving force and compulsion. It’s something that’s neatly captured by SpectraSoul’s Jack Stevens with both his new alias Workforce and label Must Make.It’s a matter that’s close to his heart. After three of SpectraSoul’s biggest years to date – during which they’ve launched their own label, released a remarkable album and gave the scene one of the most unifying bangers of last year in the form of Untitled Horn – when Jack’s partner-in-vibes Dave Kennet decided to ease off their demanding schedule and focus on his young family for a while, Jack found he was still writing, still feeding that need to create, write and ultimately express himself.Workforce is the result.The project kicks off this month with Late Night Soundtrack Volume 1. A four track EP that ranges from raw dancefloor grit to the deeper rolling sound Jack has been best known for, it’s the first in a trio of solo releases delivered throughout the year and marks a whole new chapter in Jack’s compulsion to create. It starts with the gnarled Don’t Tell and will build up throughout the month as the first volume reveals itself in all its unapologetic full-spectrum glory. Including on our very own channel UKF Drum & Bass.Producers gotta produce, interviewer gotta interview. And the first question should put every SpectraSoul fan’s mind at ease. Readers gotta read…I’ve got to ask, man. Have SpectraSoul split up?No. Definitely not. It’s quite a long timeline to be honest; we finished How We Live in the middle of 2017 and we had the Untitled Horn EP ready at that point too which was going to be released by Marcus. So after we’d made all that music we did a lot of touring. During this time Dave and his wife have got married and they’re starting a family but I’ve been writing music all this time… And this is the music.It was a good point to release it; we’d had a few amazing years as SpectraSoul, some of our best yet, so to release it now feels right. If I’d have released it after a few years where we’d been quiet or not had such a good time then that wouldn’t have been a good message to put out – for me as a solo artist or for us as SpectraSoul – but the timing feels right. And to be honest it’s been quite an experience; going into the studio on my own and seeing if I can do it on my own has been an interesting one to step up to.I was going to ask… It must be quite strange to work on your own after so many years. Kinda like riding a bike without stabilisers maybe? Not sure if that’s an appropriate comparison!No that does make sense. Working in a duo means you have reassurance; you’re either in agreement or you’re challenging each other in order to make the tune better. But on your own you don’t have that type of security. Working on your own is harder, you’re the driving force 100 percent.Yeah it’s all down to you. I love the name of the label too; Must Make. I get that from a writing perspective. Every artist I speak to is the same; you don’t feel fulfilled without making, creating, doing something. Expressing yourself.Nail on the head. That’s literally it. It came about through a podcast idea I had about speaking to fellow peers about that compulsion and how that affects their mindset, their mental health, their happiness. If I don’t feel like I’m achieving what I want to achieve then I’m a fucking nightmare. My family and friends can confirm that. I’m trying to get that under control.It’s what drives you as well though. If you have it under too much control you won’t have that burning feeling – that compulsion as you mentioned – to achieve. It’s a very fine line.Totally. It’s the reason I’m in the studio early this morning but I got back from Bristol late last night. It’s also the reason why I find it hard to give myself a day off. Even after a weekend of gigs I can’t justify to myself that taking a Monday off is okay, I need to be in the studio, I need to be progressing. So I’m learning how to have that conversation with myself and realising that taking time out can actually help the creative process; the balance is hard to achieve though isn’t it?Forever! You sound pretty balanced and motivated. Prolific, too. I’m wondering if the next EP is already locked in the chamber…Yes. I’ve got loads of things pretty much complete. I had 12-13 tracks ready and thought I’d drop them all as an album. But then I felt like maybe that would be silly and potentially go under the radar so I think I’ll do these as a series of three Late Night Soundtrack EPs. But yes, you’re right, I have written a lot. The challenge is working out what to release and which tracks to put on which EPs. That’s been a new learning curve too; when I’m writing with Dave by the time we’ve finished a track we know we’re going to release it. Not a lot ends up being shelved.You’ve got a filter as duo, like your own quality controlYeah it’s part of the process we have between us that you can’t have when you’re working on your own, it’s all really interesting and something I’m learning loads from. Even the whole process of writing an album sized body of work but releasing it as I go along is different and unusual to me. And that’s the purpose of this project – for my own sanity and fulfilment – to challenge myself and develop in a different way.You can’t pause your own creative needs…Exactly and we’re working our way through this. SpectraSoul still very much continues, we’re still playing DJ sets, we’ve not split up, we just had our best years yet… This is just my own mission I need to do. It’s been a great challenge and really inspiring which will feed back into anything else I do.Workforce – Don’t Tell is out now on Must MakeFollow Workforce: Facebook / Twitter / Instagram   ",articles39,"['… Creativity', 'Workforce', 'SpectraSoul’s', 'Jack’s', 'Jack’s', '…', 'SpectraSoul', 'SpectraSoul –', 'That’s', 'I’m', 'Prolific', 'That’s', '…', 'Instagram']"

"Junction 2, Inner City Electronic, Glastonbury... Half the country might be heading to a field this month, and half the country’s cities are hosting weekenders. But that doesn’t mean the top UK events in June 2019 don’t involve clubs, too. Those looking for evidence need only check London. DJ Mag favourite Rupture is back in action, offering deep futuristic jungle from LEVL— DB1, Forest Drive West and Felix K— with UK stepper type FAUZIA, Fracture, Sully and Digital. The Cause, meanwhile, sees ferociously heavy techno crew MOTZ host a 12-hour rave. SHXCXCHCXSH join Ostgut Ton’s Terrence Fixmer, live EBM emergents Schwefelgelb and bonafide sledgehammer Joe Farr. Oxford sees Goodness’ Day & Night confirm a line-up to die for. Running Back boss Gerd Janson, alt-techno head Laurel Halo and Hessle-affiliate Joe are heading to the Isis Farmhouse on the banks of the Thames. Edinburgh has a new party collaboration between Sneaky Pete’s Heaters and Rinse FM. Our pick from the dates is immersive techno from Object Blue, here making her Scottish debut with support from one-to-watch Jess Cohen (Texture). Glasgow institution Subculture’s Live series welcomes the legendary Larry Heard and his live Mr. Fingers stuff. And Scotland’s second city also decamps to Greater Manchester, as Optimo Music hits The White Hotel. Co-founder JD Twitch, The Golden Filter, Mr TC and Lia Mice bring everything from tech noir and guitar licks to guttural electro. Off The Cuff have a daytime party in Birmingham with Chaos In The CBD,  where Mama Roux also welcomes former-Boards of Canada head CHRIST, Suicide Circus regular and Arkada boss Errorbeauty, ADJ b2b quadruple DMC champion Mr. Switch, and Warp Records’ Plaid. The latter are affiliates of benchmark-setting Sheffield techno outfit The Black Dog, who are in town too, at The Blue Orange. All of which just leaves those festivals. Junction 2 returns to London, while Field Day gets a new home in the capital, the UK’s biggest warehouse venue and a 3AM license. Up north, Leeds’ Inner City Electronic hopes to build on the success of its first year. Liverpool, meanwhile, gets the ever-excellent Baltic Weekender.None of which is forgetting Gottwood— the lakeside institution turns ten years young in 2019 so expect even better vibes and messes than ever.

Fabric, Phonica, Drumcode and legendary Amsterdam crew VBX are amongst the stage hosts for the two days, and we’re also knocking about with Loco Dice, Apollonia, tINI, Lauren Lo Sung and Gene On Earth in the SONUS area. Highlights elsewhere are almost guaranteed to include Call Super b2b Shanti Celeste and Umfang b2b Volvox— pairings that make as much sense as buying a ticket to see them. Having said that, you could do far worse than check into Daniel Avery, Ricardo Villalobos, Craig Richards, Mr G, Peach, Batu, rRoxymore, Sonja Moonear b2b Nicolas Lutz or Imogen while in the neighbourhood.

But before I do I want to apologize again, and to say clearly that all of this has been my own fault. I am the one who released the book without showing it to the people I wrote about. I’m the one who posted defensively and arrogantly. I’m the one who behaved inconsiderately and disrespectfully, both in 2019 and in 1999. There is obviously no one else to blame but me.

Last year a parliamentary inquiry found that 176 venues had closed in the city since the laws' introduction.Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Premier Berejiklian stated: ""After five years of operation, it makes sense for us to now take stock and examine whether any further changes should be made.

It contains several previously-unreleased tracks that were completed by the artist himself, alongside works that required finishing touches based on specific notes he left prior to his passing. Collaborations include Vargas & Lagola, Aloe Blacc, Imagine Dragons and Bonn.To support the record a series of Cubes will be situated in six cities across the world— Sydney, Tokyo, Stockholm, London, New York and Sao Paulo. Fans can place their hands on an illuminated screen, which will connect to another active device and play the same album clip to both listeners simultaneously. The idea is to unite strangers in wildly different regions of the world through the music of Bergling, who won a Grammy earlier this year and MTV EMA late-2018. Both were awarded posthumously.

If you start drinking at your job, your manager is supposed to take care of you quickly,"" he continued. ""Life as a DJ and travels where you don’t get any rest between, you travel a lot you sleep less.

"But Calvin Harris still netted a cool $48million... Forbes’ World’s Highest-Paid DJs, topped by Calvin Harris, are earning the lowest amount since 2013 according to this year's International Music Summit report from Ibiza.Dance music's share of the global music market in general has declined over the 12 months to December 2018. The UK saw the biggest loss— from 11.6 to 9.5%. In the US, the drop was from 3.5 to 3%. Germany and Canada, meanwhile, actually saw electronic genres grow during the same period.The top 10 names in the most recent Forbes Highest-Paid DJs list saw overall earnings decline significantly, bringing in a total of $261million combined— the lowest since 2013. This can at least be partly attributed to attendance numbers in Las Vegas, the most financially significant club market in the world, where just 7% of visitors went to a dance event last year, less than half the number in 2016.  Despite this, dance and electronic music styles rank as the third most popular on the planet, with an estimated 1.5billion people listening to associated sounds worldwide. It's also worth noting that the video games industry, which is worth more than seven-times its music counterpart, has had a major impact on the electronic scene of late. Dixon, The Black Madonna, Solomun and Tale of Us appeared in 'Grand Theft Auto', Marshmello performed live inside 'Fortnite' and Skrillex made the theme tune to 'Kingdom Hearts III' with Hikaru Utada and Poo Bear. Read our in-depth feature on electronic music's newest frontier. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"It's the first DJ hardware to incorporate streaming without a computer…DENON DJ today announced that they'll be updating their PRIME series DJ hardware to include streaming capabilities. The new update, which will be rolled out throughout the summer, will include streaming directly from Beatport, SoundCloud, TiDAL and Beatsource without a computer. As the PRIME series hardware is already WiFi- and Ethernet-ready, users will log in to their relevant accounts and can access pre-made playlists and curated ones. Beatport PRO users (prices for the PRO subscription are yet to be confirmed) can download up to 100 tracks to store on the device for offline play and tracks that you stream are cached as they're loaded to avoid any dropout issues.To load a track, users simply search the appropriate service using the touch screen. You can add hot cues and loop points to the streamed tracks, though it's not clear how much metadata is stored on the streamed track, or if the waveforms are instantly visible or if an analysis process is required.Either way, it's a huge step forward for DJ technology, and one we expected to happen much later than one week after Beatport's announcement.

"The Beauty & The Beat founder took $75 Jan Leslie Holmes cut... DJ Cedric Woo has apologised for stealing from Brooklyn's Northern Lights Records according to an Instagram post.  A clip showing a man who was 'positively IDed as Cedric Woo' removing a vinyl record from the shelves and hiding it behind his rucksack caused a huge reaction on the social network yesterday, Tuesday 7th May. The piece was a 12"" copy of 'I'm Your Superman' by Jan Leslie Holmes, worth $75. A London-based, French-born player and founder of the Beauty & The Beat parties, Woo— AKA Cedric Lassonde— was in New York to appear on The Lot Radio, according to his own social media updates. Following the accusation his Instagram and Facebook profiles, and website, were taken offline. An additional post by Northern Lights has now confirmed the DJ ""reached out to us to apologize [sic] and has paid for the record"". In a bizarre twist to the tale, Woo has apparently wound up handing over ""significantly more"" cash than the record was worth. Vinyl sales have undergone a significant resurgence in recent years, with 16.8million units shifted in the US alone last year. Brooklyn is a hotbed of record stores in New York, as is proven by our story on the two new outlets opening for business in the borough.  MAJOR UPDATE the culprit has been positively IDed as Cedric Woo @cedwoo from London.

"Fear of failure, loneliness and financial instability were major contributors... 73% of independent musicians suffer from mental illness, a new study by distribution company Record Union has found. The online survey was conducted between 21st March and 2nd April and involved close to 1,500 artists, with 1/3 admitting they suffered panic attacks. Other issues included negative pressure, negative stress, anxiety and depression. Entitled 'The 73 Percent Report', the results show that fear of failure, loneliness and financial instability were major contributing factors. Record Union has committed to donate $30,000 to projects that aim to tackle or prevent mental illness amongst musicians. The fund is currently open for applications. The subject has been a serious talking point for a number of years, with high profile deaths like Avicii and The Prodigy's Keith Flint providing heartbreaking examples of stars who have lost their lives to the worst outcomes of mental health problems. Ben Pearce, dubstep originator Benga and electronic guru Fever Ray have all spoken out about their own experiences, as has James Blake. Artists are not the only ones suffering. Ticketing website Skiddle found that 82% of music industry workers were subjected to 'intense and unmanageable stress' in its own study last year.

Promoters are calling IICON “part gig, part club, part art installation, part theatre,” for something completely new and immersive.Along with the tour, IICON will return to Glastonbury Festival every year, including a special show in 2020 to help celebrate Glastonbury's 50th anniversary.  Glastonbury is getting its own overhaul this year, with an “enormous” Victorian pier.

"The Pioneer Corp is selling its stake in Pioneer DJ according to reports…Pioneer DJ is reportedly for sale, with its two owners – Pioneer Corp and KKR & Co – considering selling off their stakes in the DJ behemoth. In 2015, Pioneer sold 85% of Pioneer DJ to KKR, retaining 15% but creating a separate company in the process. With sales of around $200m last year, it's expected to land around $500m when it's eventually sold.The news came via Resident Advisor who spotted the news in a Nikkei Business article.What could it mean for the DJ market? For now, not a lot. Unless Pioneer DJ is acquired by a competitor, it's likely to be business as usual and as the company controls between 60-70% of global DJ hardware sales, it won't be short of bidders. Most likely, it'll be another investment company who'll replace KKR and things will tick over as normal. That's what Pioneer DJ expect too, in a statement Mark Grotefeld, Pioneer DJ General Manager, made on the news to Digital DJ Tips yesterday: “In 2015, Pioneer DJ separated from Pioneer Corporation (car and home audio) becoming a completely separate entity, focusing on the electronic music industry.Despite recent articles, our mission to continue to innovate and inspire people globally will continue in 2019 and beyond. We are committed to investing in the industry and inspiring creativity in DJs and artists through the support of product development and production.As a result, our business continues to demonstrate positive growth thanks to the ongoing support of our customers. We look forward to delivering more innovative products and a very exciting future in the electronic music industry.” So there you have it — Pioneer itself is potentially getting out of the DJ business (it essentially already did in 2015, bar the 15% stake it retained), but Pioneer DJ will continue as normal. They've been busy too, with a new DDJ-800 controller and SQUID sequencer announced in the last month alone. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"He's also planning to release his memoirs...Seemingly not content with the disaster of 2017's now infamous Fyre Festival, organiser Billy McFarland has ruffled some feathers by hinting at plans for a second edition. McFarland has recently been in touch with freelance editor Josh Raab about getting his memoirs published, which he's been writing from prison while he serves a six-year sentence for fraud-related charges. Raab says that the memoirs have a work-in-progress title of ""Promythus: The God of Fyre"", and that contact was initially made with him through McFarland's girlfriend, Anastasia Eremenko.McFarland claims that the memoirs will tell the story of the festival with details that weren't uncovered by the documentaries produced by Netflix and Hulu, though Raab says that he has seen neither film. He's been writing the pages and mailing them to Eremenko to be typed up.Raab says that McFarland is planning to self-publish the book with money earned from its sale intended to go some way to paying back the vast amount of money he owes, as well as to the workers who were affected by the doomed festival. He also told Raab in one email that he's hoping to get the book finished as quickly as possible because Fyre's 2017 edition ""will not be a one and done event — it’s happening again, so the original story will lose the potential to be told and set the stage if it’s not done before the next events take place"".The editor says that he ultimately declined the chance to work with McFarland on publishing the book.Fyre Festival merch was recently auctioned off to help raise some money to reimburse the local workers that weren't paid by the event's organisers. Earlier this year, McFarland was ordered to pay over $3 million to a former investor.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"30 people were treated at Teknival festival following severe unexpected snowfall...30 ravers had to be treated for hypothermia this past weekend at France’s Teknival festival.Taking place in Creuse, the free and unauthorised hardcore/hardstyle festival was attended by over 10,000 ravers for its annual French edition from 4th - 5th May. However, unexpected snowfall saw temperatures plummet to -3 degrees Celsius on Saturday night, leaving ravers at risk.The festival’s organisers reportedly set up a heating tent provided by the military to keep attendees safe before the Red Cross could arrive, after which 500 survival blankets were handed out. Luckily, no one was seriously hurt, though two attendees had to visit hospital as a result of hypothermia, local officials told AFP.Teknival has been running for 26 years, with various incarnations of the event taking place throughout Europe but returning to France every year for its main edition. The location of the festival is only revealed to attendees immediately ahead of kick-off in an attempt to ensure no interference prevents it from taking place.Upon noticing the arrival of thousands of revelers ahead of the event, local authorities, under the instruction of Mayor Nathalie Peyrat of Creuse’s Féniers commune, had made attempts to put a stop to proceedings. Trucks carrying soundsystems were stopped but the festival continued in earnest before several centimetres of snow but an end to things.According to a report in La Parisien, by Monday morning roughly 600 “diehards” were left on site of the original 10,000 attendees. You can see some official footage from the festival below. The French military, who own the site the rave was held on, have reportedly filed an official complaint to the organisers.Last year, to celebrate its 25th birthday, Teknival took place in an old military base in northern France.

"Each defendant could now face 36 years in prison... The trial has begun for Derick Almena and Max Harris, the two suspects believed to be responsible for the deadly fire at Oakland club Ghost Ship during a 100% Silk party in 2016. The pair face 36 counts of manslaughter, including the deaths of artists Cherushii, Nackt, Cash Askew, Obsidian Blade and Visual Aids. Both defendants were given nine and six year sentences respectively in 2018, but Judge James Crane rejected this due to a lack of remorse shown by Almena. Families of the victims also criticised the leniency of the original decision.If convicted this time, the men could potentially each receive 36 years in prison. Almena's legal representative has stated he plans on arguing defence based on the tragedy being the result of arson, with Harris' lawyer also looking to argue that blame should be placed at more feet than the defendants alone. This includes the local government, fire department and landlord, Chor Ng, who it has been claimed was aware of deficiencies in the building's electrical wiring before the blaze. Oakland city officials and Ng face civil cases, due to start in October. Avalon Emerson, who played one of her first sets at Ghost Ship's predecessor, Ghost Town, dedicated her BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix of last summer to the victims, closing the two-hour selection with Oakland band Them Are Us Too.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

Beasley-Murray has recorded an open conclusion for the singer’s death, stating, “We will never quite know what was going on in his mind on that date and so that’s why I’m going to record an open conclusion.”“I’ve considered suicide,” Beasley-Murray stated in the report. “To record that, I would have to have found that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Flint formed the idea and took a deliberate action knowing it would result in his death. Having regard to all the circumstances I don’t find that there’s enough evidence for that.”According to the report, there was insufficient evidence for Beasley-Murray to rule out or confirm that Flint’s death was an accident, where he may have been “larking around and it all went horribly wrong”, thus adding to the decision to record an open conclusion.“He clearly was extremely popular,” Beasley-Murray added. “He was much-loved by so many fans. It’s been very touching to see that, and of course I’m aware of the funeral service that was held in Bocking.”The inquest was delivered in the absence of Flint’s family and manager who were aware of the hearing but did not wish to attend.Earlier this week, a message was shared on The Prodigy’s official social media channels directing fans to numerous mental health charities and suicide prevention initiatives. “It has been a tough time for everyone over the last few weeks since Keef's passing,” the message reads “If you are struggling with depression, addiction or the impact of suicide, please do not suffer in silence. The Prodigy fully support the campaign to improve mental health for all and give it the respect it deserves.”www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"The Berlin synth conference wrapped last week. Here's the best of what was announced...Berlin's Superbooth conference – founded by the synth sorcerers Schneider's Buero – has gone from strength to strength over the past few years, growing from a small, niche, synth gathering to a fully fledged exhibition and conference, featuring the biggest names and brands in MusicTech. It's been known to count Ricardo Villalobos and Nina Kraviz among its visitors, and those are just the punters – the event also features performances from artists who are pushing technology and synthesis to its limits.Like all conferences, it's also an opportunity for companies to announce their new synth-focussed goodies, ahead of releasing them later in the year. This year, there were plenty of announcements, and while some focused exclusively on modular synths and esoteric one-offs, the big boys also had some new hardware to shout about. Here are our picks of the best of synths and drum machines from Superbooth 2019. Novation Summit | £1,899Novation's Peak was a hugely well-received bit of kit, featuring eight voices and analogue filters in a handy portable form factor. Now, Novation have announced Summit and it's not just a clever name. Building on the design of Peak, Summit is a 16-voice, 61-key synth with heaps of synthesis options and includes those much-loved analogue filters. Novation have also added a multi-timbral engine meaning two completely independent patches can be stacked, or split, playing the sounds at the same time for extra power. Other features include fully analogue distortion, plenty of FX including reverb, chorus and delay and New Oxford oscillators that are capable of wavetable, FM and of course, subtractive synthesis. Tasty! All this power will cost you £1,899. Korg Minilogue XD Module | $549Korg's original Minilogue was hugely popular, bringing fully analogue poly sounds to studios around the world, for a bargain price. The newer XD version added a few more features, including a new joystick, extra presets and a more comprehensive sequencer. Now they're bringing those features to a module version, with no keys, but an extra Poly Chain function that lets you chain voices together across multiple Minilogues. That's up to eight voices of pure analogue poly, for under a grand. Not bad eh?Elektron Digitone Keys | £1,180The Digitone was a bit of a departure for Elektron, but one that's hugely paid off – given its lower price and unique sounds and functions, it was a smash hit with synth fans. As you might imagine, the Digitone Keys slaps a 37-note keybed on the side of the module (classic Elektron), throwing in some extra knobs and modulation wheels in the process. There's loads more info in our story here, but if you're already familiar with the Digitone, you already know this is gonna be good. IK Multimedia Uno Drum | €249IK Multimedia's first foray into synth design was the Uno Synth, a cute little unit with a fully analogue architecture at a bargain price. Now they've created the Uno Drum, a fully analogue drum machine with the same form factor, buttons and design. It's got 12 tracks to record your sequences with some parts using PCM over analogue sounds for a varied output. On top of that, it's under £250 – considering how good the Uno Synth sounded, we're expecting the same quality from the new Drum alternative. Behringer DS-80 | £UnknownThose cheeky chaps at Behringer are at it again – teasing a re-creation of a classic analogue that would otherwise cost us humble producers thousands. It's hard to know if it will ever see the light of day, but with the Pro-One and Minimoog recreations finally on shelves, maybe Behringer are finally sticking to their guns and we'll see the re-creations sooner rather than later. Undoubtedly one of the most sought-after synths on the planet, the original CS-80 now goes for upwards of £15k. If Behringer can bring it in at under a grand, with a similar sound, this will be their boldest move yet. But we won't hold our breath…Make sure you keep checking DJ Mag Tech for all the latest news and updates from the world of synths, studios and drum machines.

"He has also released a comic book series, Neon Future...Steve Aoki is moving into the fitness business, launching a brand new workout app called Aoki Bootcamp.Aoki says that his busy schedule makes it hard for him to stick to a fitness routine, but would fit in some workout time wherever he could.""I’m the kind of guy who will work out wherever I am, whether I’m in the green room or backstage at a festival or in my hotel room,"" he explains. ""I’d been putting my workout on social media and people would come up to me and I thought that I really wanted to bring this out so people can join in.""The workouts on Aoki Bootcamp require no special equipment, and can be carried out anywhere. Subscriptions to the app though will cost $12.99 a month or an annual subscription can be obtained for $99.99. The app is available in Apple's App Store and via Google Play.Aoki also earlier this week unveiled plans to launch a comic book series he's calling 'Neon Futures'. The story will follow a future where humans and technology exist in harmony, avoiding the kind of dystopian vision you might get from this concept from others.""A general plot is that technology is destroying humanity,"" Aoki said. ""The robots are going to make us their slaves, or the human species is going to be exterminated by technology. But in this case, we are going to become augmented. We use technology for the good. It’s a different kind of story.""Earlier this year, Aoki announced that he would feature as a character in the new Star Trek Command video game.

"The new service lets DJs stream Beatport's catalogue into DJing software…Beatport have launched a new subscription service for DJs called LINK. The new service lets DJs stream Beatport's catalogue into DJ performance software, starting with Pioneer DJ's WeDJ app and soon into their flagship rekordbox dj. Once LINK lands in rekordbox DJ in Q3 2019, it'll bring with it an ability to access curated playlists, higher quality audio and offline performance mode.Beatport have also launched CLOUD, a new set of features for the store's ""loyal customer base"".

Both services are currently in beta. The news comes off the back of a year of speculation, as Beatport initially announced its intentions to stream its catalogue into DJ software at Ibiza Music Summit 2018. 12 months later, the dance music giant has made good on its promise. The implications of streaming in the booth have been discussed widely – how the new subscription model plays out, we'll have to wait and see. No word yet on when or if LINK is coming to Traktor, Serato or other DJing software but we'd guess it's not far behind.

"A remix competition will be judged by a panel including the legendary broadcaster himself…David Attenborough is looking for producers to remix his 70-year-old field recordings.As part of a new competition launched by Songlines magazines and PRS Foundation, music makers are being invited to remix recordings captured by the legendary broadcaster – who celebrates his 93rd birthday this week – in Bali over 70 years ago.An album of Attenborough’s field recordings, ‘My Field Recordings From Across The Planet’ was released in November 2018. These recordings were taken between 1954 and 1963 while Attenborough was travelling to remote parts of the world to film exotic animals for the BBC television series Zoo Quest. In his spare time, he used to use recording equipment to capture the numerous musical performances and rituals of the people he met.The recording in question for the competition was captured in Bali in 1956, and features the sound of a gamelan orchestra he met while recording a documentary about the komodo dragon. Listen to the recording below. “The villagers will sit down while the leader of the gamelan orchestra will convey his composition, teaching them, one at a time how to play,” Attenborough told Songlines in an interview last year. ""They then play this concerted music with extraordinary precision and real zest. So it is haunting music that you hear every night – or you did in those days, in the villages of Bali.”""The traditions that had been developed over centuries were still continued with no knowledge of Western styles of music, which since then have enveloped the world,"" he addded. ""So these sounds which I captured with that clumsy tape recorder 60 years ago have a quality that you wouldn't be able to replicate today.""The piece is called ‘Gender Wayang’, after a style of gamelan playing native to Bali, and is comprised of two metallophones and one pair of drums. You can hear it below.Entries to the competition will initially be judged by a panel of experts, including Gilles Peterson, Ghostpoet, Matthew Herbert, Hannah Peel, Cerys Matthews and Attenborough himself. A shortlist of six remixes will be chosen by the judges before being passed to a public vote to decide the winner.Entries close Monday 10th June. Voting will take place from 19th July to 15th September with the winner being announced on 1st November.For more information on how to enter, click here. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"It is the second track to be shared from the forthcoming album, ‘TIM’... The second single to be released from Avicii’s posthumous album ‘TIM’ will be released tomorrow, 9th May.‘Tough Love’ was made in collaboration with Vincent Pontare and Salem Al Fakir (AKA Vargas & Lagola), both of whom had worked with the late producer – real name Tim Bergling –  before on tracks like ‘Silhouettes’, ‘Hey Brother’, ‘Without You’.The track was 80% finished at the time of the EDM star’s death in April 2018 and features vocals from Vargas and his wife, award winning Swedish singer/songwriter Agnes. ""This one needs to be a duet,” Avicii had written in his notes while working on the track. “Coolest thing would be a real couple. Or a couple that have worked together enough to be almost considered a couple!""‘Tough Love’ features a melodic passage inspired by Bergling’s time spent studying the music of northwest India.""Oddly enough, the Indian influences fit perfectly into a song we were working on, something that was so typical of Tim"" Vincent Pontare wrote in an official statement. ""He was a melodic genius.”You can watch a video detailing Pontare and Al Fakir’s creative process while finishing ‘Tough Love’ below.'Tough Love' follows the release of single 'SOS', which was released in April.‘TIM’ will be released on 6th June.

"It requires just a couple of AAA batteries to run...A new pocket-size drum machine and synth called Bitty has been launched.The small instrument is the work of manufacturer Curious Sound Objects and comes with a speaker constructed from aluminium that promises to go a lot louder than you might expect from something of its size.It runs on just a couple of AAA batteries and allows users to play drums and melodies either manually or using a number of pre-set patterns. The machine also allows users to change the tempo of the 12 bit sound it outputs. In order to add different sound packs to the machine, users just have to connect it to their computers via USB and upload them. You can find more information on the machine via the link below. It's currently at the crowdfunding stage of its production.For more unusual synths, read about the step sequencer made from lego bricks.A long-lost '70s synthesiser called the Resynator is the subject of a forthcoming documentary which is also seeking crowdfunding.www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Local crew Dirtytalk aim to raise £45,000 for music and arts space, Strange Brew…Bristol promotion team Dirtytalk have launched a crowdfunding campaign to fund the creation of a new music and arts venue in the city, named Strange Brew.With a capacity of 330 people, the multi-use space will boast a large bar/café area that will also be used for live performances, exhibitions and hold a small record shop, plus separate secondary performance room.The team plan to work with local sound engineers Amber Audio to install a high-grade D&B Audio soundsystem, and extra thought has clearly gone into providing gender-neutral toilets and lockers, to avoid a long line for the cloakroom.Bristol nightlife has taken a serious hit in recent years. Legendary venue Lakota announced closure last year, alongside band-orientated space Bierkeller, while Blue Mountain and Thekla also came close to shutting down. “We hope that by bringing a new space into being we will be helping to address this decline and at the same time offering an exciting new venue for the city,” say the Dirtytalk group via their Crowdfunder page.Learn more about Strange Brew here and in the video below. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

At the time of writing, Carola is still listed on the lineup for tonight’s party at Pacha.It's All About The Music SL’s representative told Diario De Ibiza that Carola ""has broken the contract he signed with us just like with Amnesia,” adding that their client regretted the ""traumatic breakdown in relations"" between the two parties.

"The future of the iconic US festival remains uncertain...  Miami City Council has reopened talks that could see the city host Ultra again in 2020. Meanwhile, a separate vote has paved the way for the event to be held at Homestead Speedway next year. March saw the most recent edition of the iconic US festival debut at Virginia Key after two decades at Bayfront Park. Despite incredible sets, the weekend was marred by problems, with shuttle bus issues leaving some attendees stranded for hours, noise complaints and a significant increase in traffic in the area. The team behind Ultra voluntarily withdrew the contract earlier this month, effectively ruling out returning to the new venue. Nevertheless, a 'Sunshine Meeting' involving Miami City Manager Emilio Gonzalez and various other council members was held yesterday, Tuesday 21st May, in which Keon Hardemon, one of the city's commissioners, suggested he would like organisers to consider moving back to a downtown location, possibly South Beach. Another vote, also on Tuesday, saw members of the Homestead City Council vote to extend the Homestead-Miami Speedway venue license to 2AM should Ultra want to move the action there. This is despite several residents expressing concerns regarding noise levels and drug use. www.djmag.comThrust Publishing Ltd, PO Box 71897 London N1P 1HH United Kingdom.

"Move over Mozart, Stormzy is where exams should be... Calls have been made for electronic music to replace classical in UK school lessons. National charity Youth Music believes offering grime, hip hop and electronic music as part of the curriculum, rather than more traditional compositions, could help improve attendance, personal and social development amongst disadvantaged and disengaged pupils. ""We've seen the benefits of students exchanging Mozart for Stormzy as part of a re-imagined music curriculum,"" said Matt Griffiths, Chief Executive of Youth Music.""Schools can offer an inspirational music curriculum that better supports social and emotional well-being, the music industry talent pipeline grows and is more diverse, and young people's lives in music are completely connected both in and out of school.""A four-year research project run by Youth Music and Birmingham City University found that more inclusive music courses can make a significant difference to the attainment of struggling students.  DJing is already an option for UK children studying a GCSE in music, usually aged between 14 and 16.

"Photo by Paul Bergen/Redferns via Getty Images The self-proclaimed ""Dean of American Rock Critics,"" Robert Christgau was one of the pioneers of music criticism as we know it—the music editor of the Village Voice from 1974 to 1985 and its chief music critic for several decades after that. At the Voice he created both the annual Pazz & Jop Critics’ Poll and his monthly Consumer Guides. Christgau was one of the first critics to write about hip-hop and the only one to review Simon & Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water with one word: ""Melodic."" He taught at New York University between 1990 and 2016, and has published eight books, including his 2015 memoir Going Into the City . His most recent, Book Reports: A Music Critic on His First Love, Which Was Reading, is now available from Duke University Press. Every Friday we run Expert Witness, the weekly version of the Consumer Guide he launched in 2010. To find out more, read his  welcome post; for almost five decades of critical reviews, check out his regularly updated  website. Lee ""Scratch"" Perry:  Rainford (On-U Sound) Riddled with reissues, collaborations, bootlegs, remixes, and of course dubs, the Upsetter's catalogue is beyond comprehension. Post 2011, when he turned 75, Wikipedia lists 13 albums while omitting more titles than I'm mad enough to compare-and-contrast from Spotify's offerings; upsetter.net credits 30 undated albums to ""Lee Perry"" and 12 more to ""Lee Perry &""; etc. But if you care about the greatest of the dubmasters, this project, overseen for the 84-year-old by great white dubmaster Adrian Sherwood, is an album that holds together. Is there a single track as head-turning as, to name a few personal faves, ""I Am a Psychiatrist,"" ""Messy Appartment,"" or ""Poop Song""? Definitely the ""Autobiography of the Upsetter"" finale, possibly the ""Cricket on the Moon"" opener, but in the end it doesn't matter, because all nine tracks achieve both solidity and differentiation—sound good without sounding too much like any of the others. Take a wild guess and thank Sherwood, whose 1983 African Head Charge release  Drastic Season has won my ears and heart as I've done my due diligence. I'll never know where this album stands or sprawls in Perry's oeuvre, But I do know that it will now replace 2004's  Panic in Babylon as my go-to Upsetter.  A MINUS Tanya Tagaq:  Toothsayer (Six Shooter) On a widely streamable not-(yet?)-for-sale EP commissioned to add aural buzz to the British National Maritime Museum's ""Polar Worlds"" exhibit, the throat-singing Inuk avant-gardist assumes all vocal and compositional responsibilities. No hip-hop, no Nirvana covers, not even any male-sounding shamanistic croaks—the closest analogy is Fluxus-period Yoko Ono with the disruptive techniques referencing content more concrete, organic, and political than shock for education's sake or existential despair. We can hear this because we know how urgently Tagaq cares about both global warming and indigenous peoples. For half an hour she emits dozens of nonverbal sounds well beyond croons and screams—squeaks, belches, agonized gutturals, many more. This is music that mourns the end of the world. She wants it to disturb us, and it should.  A MINUS Sneaks:  Highway Hypnosis (Merge) Former Shitstain Eva Moolchan's 2016 album was one-woman minimalist rock of real but limited charm.

The atmospheric ""Beliefs"" repeats the mantra ""Remove your beliefs and start again"" seven times in 2:42 as if shaken to the core by whoever inspired the 56-second mantra ""Holy Cow I Never Saw a Girl Like Her.""

"Diplo: Photo by Brian Stukes/Getty Images, Charli XCX: Photo by Joe Maher/Getty ImagesThere are some songs that are sacred. There are some artists who transcended music and left their indomitable mark on pop culture. The Spice Girls easily fall into those categories. We are still outfitting ourselves in 90s attire—just look at the platform sneakers and space bun hairstyles they popularized that are still floating around. Unsurprisingly, their ""Girl Power"" slogan is still alive and well, and maybe even more meaningful now as the public reckons with the treatment of women in male-dominated industries. But, we can't live in 1996 forever. We've already experienced enough reboots of classic films and I was fully prepared to draw the line at Diplo and Charli XCX's remake of the pop group's debut single ""Wannabe."" Except, I couldn't because it was actually good. ""Spicy"" is Charli and Diplo's take on ""Wannabe,"" which trades the original's simplistic production for the tropical basslines Diplo has become known for. The song begins with a beautiful guitar line, which isn't exactly how the Spice Girls would do it. The original production mimics Scary Spice's energy, but the guitars at the beginning of ""Spicy"" are enough to put you to sleep. The sound is hard to place. It's not quite dancehall, not quite reggaeton, which must have been what Rihanna meant by ""airport reggae."" There's no ""Wannabe"" without that hook, except the hook isn't there. There's no ""I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT WHAT I REALLY, REALLY WANT!"" and more importantly, no ""Zig-a-zig-ah!"" But, it's chorus, or lack of one, makes the familiar song feel fresh. Is this the Diplo effect? It's actually kind of genius that they eliminated the most memorable part of the song and chopped the beat. Even though she's singing a song about friendship by herself, there's something about the way they chop the whole thing up that makes it feel alive again. By the end of the song, I am swaying.

" Max Allison releases a lot of music, on his own under the name Mukqs and in collaboration with others—most famously in the drone trio Good Willsmith, but also in a number of other configurations.He's made a habit out of chunking out disorienting and otherworldly electronic music at a pace that's pretty hard to keep up with. Earlier this month, he released  SD Biomix, a full-length project for the boundary-pushing experimental label Orange Milk, and next week, he'll release another called  Mem Aleph on the more dance-focused label Jacktone. Earlier this year, he released a tape with the Chicago folk-rap legend Sharkula, and he plans to have even more music out before the end of 2019. There's probably more that I'm not even aware of.  Each release is distinct from the last. Allison's as likely to turn in a straight up techno tape as he is frenetic sound collages and blunted rap beats. His catalog is predictable only in the sense that it is unpredictable, but for him, that's part of the point of putting out all this stuff. ""I like the idea of an overarching project that contains so many different styles that it's impossible to guess what awaits you when you press play on a given album,"" he says. ""To me, this embodies the important concept that people are not just one thing, and don't have to feel like they're cornered into meeting expectations once they establish some kind of norm."" It's a vision of a freer kind of music-making, driven by an ability to follow any particular idea down to its end point. The resultant stuff never fits neatly into any given genre, but that's where the best music lives anyway, in the in-between spaces, melting across the borders between sounds and styles. Allison demonstrates this approach, in all its vibrancy, on the six skittering tracks that make up  Mem Aleph. He's able to swim through aqueous electro, dizzy ambient passages, and more thunderous techno tropes with ease—splatter painting sequenced synths across it in a way that feels indebted to brainy 90s Warp releases. It's a whole lot of sounds and moods all bleeding into each other—an example in microcosm of the joy of following his catalog as a whole.  In celebration of  SD Biomix and  Mem Aleph, Allison put together an hour-long mix for our series, which, as expected, doesn't really hold fast to any specific genre. There's fleet-footed singeli from Tanzania, butting right up against experimental Japanese pop music, and busted up club tracks from Pittsburgh. It's overwhelming, in a good way. You'll want to surrender to the flood. Listen below, alongside an interview with Allison about his delirious approach to production.   NOISEY: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting?Max Allison: I tend to use music as a means of escaping whatever is going on around me, to enter another little dimension at will and escape the real world. This mix could be listened to for a little vacation while you're sitting at a desk working on some other task, or zoning in on something that you really don't want to be dealing with. That being said, it would probably sound nice while you're sitting by a body of water tripping your face off or relaxing however you choose to relax.  Was there any specific concept to the mix?When I was putting this mix together I compiled a list of 60+ songs that I've been into lately, and grouped them all into categories like ""FRENETIC DANCE"" or ""PURE DRIFT"" or ""LOOPY GLITCH,"" etc. From there I tried to figure out the exact transitions between these moods, with the goal of making either a lot of harsh juxtapositions or to keep the mood flowing between tracks.  Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?I've been obsessed with this song from the soundtrack of the anime series  White Album 2 for years now. The series revolves around an extracurricular music club at a high school who come together to play very ""basic"" guitar + piano + vocals ballads, but the tracks that they perform all really connect with me on an emotional level. So it was fun for me to plant that maximum emotional atmosphere as the juxtaposition after the Container track, which represents a peak of manic, wild energy to me.  Is synesthesia a real thing? If so, what color is this mix?I fully believe in synesthesia and experience some small degree of it myself when I listen to music, but I feel like the people that harp on it and brag about their synesthetic powers are kind of full of shit and seeking attention. I have a friend who experiences very distinct colors when she sees certain numbers, but you would never know that about her from just hanging with her because she doesn't really talk about it. This is the approach to synesthesia that I appreciate. The first overtly like, full imagery / color / landscape experience I can ever remember having while listening to music was the first time I listened to Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" when I was like 13. I remember being totally stunned by the hugeness of the stereo spread, the way that so many different instruments and multiple rhythm sections / horn sections / keyboards / etc. were all stacked together in such a vast array that seemed to create a physical space beyond the world we know. I remember seeing a massive orange / blue wall (probably in keeping with the album cover tones) that was rippling at various levels in my mind, and just being floored by the whole landscape in my head.  I think the color of this mix is somewhere in that realm, where the sounds and textures are moving too fast past you to create any sort of discrete color, but make more like a multicolor mosaic that's constantly quivering and shifting into new forms.   This is maybe an existential question, but with all the different music you've released as Mukqs, what do you feel like is the shared DNA between all of that stuff?This is hard for me to answer because I think part of my approach to the project is trying to work on many different ideas and albums that might not seem to vibe together on the basic level of genre or style. I think people are way too complex to limit themselves to any one form of expression, and I feel like people often get trapped in this mindset when they make something that they perceive to be appreciated by other people and then feel pressure to follow it up with something similar, or something that takes one baby step away from that original style. To me, baby steps aren't interesting. I would rather plunge into something totally different and fool around there for a while and experiment, rather than reiterate whatever I've already made. At this point, there have been too many branches of the Mukqs project for that to be a problem anymore—nothing can really be reiterated, because there has never been a solid ground to stand on. That being said, there are some major tenets that I think connect the different styles I work in. I get bored very easily when making music, and always err on the side of constant mutation and variation within a given song or album. This comes through in the ""noise"" material I make, in the ""dance"" material I make, in the music inspired by hip-hop or video game music, and especially in the sound collage idiom, which I think has the most freedom for more randomized recombination and juxtaposition of sounds.   Mem Aleph , like most of your Mukqs work, comes from improvised live sessions. Can you speak generally about hone something so open as that into a coherent project? And then specifically, what were the raw materials and ideas that informed this record?Everything is live, and performed on my rig of hardware, but everything is not necessarily fully ""improvised."" Some tracks come from a more strictly regimented performance where I've set up a very specific set of samples or a narrative structure that I'm following pretty closely—even if the individual sounds or synth patches or drum patterns that appear within that track might have originated in a moment of improv. At that point, it's more like stacking together the random bits into something that might resemble a track. This happens to the most extreme degree on my Orange Milk album  SD Biomix, which contains both tracks that are fully improvised from top to bottom with hands on electronics / drum machines / loopers, etcetera, and tracks that are more deliberate in how I trigger a sampler to play back a specific palette of tones. For the  Mem Aleph material, improvisation comes into play in a couple ways. I performed the A side (tracks 1-3) on my drum machine and sampler, and while there were some general cues—I was aiming for to transition between tracks every 6-8 minutes or whatever—the individual decisions I make about what drum patterns or synth samples to activate are all on the spot, so the narratives are improvised based on whatever sounds I decided to trigger to transition between different parts. The B-side (tracks 4-6), which I performed with a tape deck, looper, and drum machine, relies more heavily on random chance.   Can you tell me about your history with the dancefloor and how that side of your interest have eked into Mukqs over time? To what degree does ""the rave"" figure into the stuff you are doing?All of the music that I've made in the ""dance""-related style came into being because my friends asked me to play live sets at their specific events, and I wanted to do those events justice, with the hope that people could have fun listening to my sets. These events are all ""raves"" to some degree, so that's the style that I end up working within. Outside of those specific events, I love dancing, love going to see DJs or live electronic music. This is one of my favorite things in the world, and I've been lucky enough to meet a lot of friends who always take me to interesting mental and physical places when they perform in those styles. But ""the rave"" is only one small aspect of a huge spread of different music. I think as I get older I come to see how deeply all these genres and types of performances are connected, in terms of individual musical elements and in terms of just the general atmosphere and good will emanating from making and performing art. Nothing stands alone—everything is everything, obviously.  What's next? I know that's a wild thing to be asking when you've put out two full-lengths in a month. When do you sleep?Honestly, both of these full-length projects represent music that I made somewhere in the 2016-2018 time period, so to me they're more like time capsules that both happened to be unearthed by my friends' labels at a similar time just due to the way that their release schedules worked out. I haven't made any new Mukqs music since the beginning of 2019, partially because I've been too busy with other projects and working to make money to live, partially because I have been anticipating the release of these albums (plus the two other albums that came out earlier in the year), and have been waiting for all this ""old"" material to finally surface, so I can move on from it and make something totally different. The vast majority of the time I've spent making art over the last six months has been working on album art for our releases on Hausu Mountain, which is something that I've been trying to personally level up and take very seriously.  That, plus way too many other musical projects—but those are all collaborative projects, and typically take the form of discrete rehearsals and live sets—situations where I'm not locked away in my room forever working on tracks. But I'm about to hit another stride this summer of working on new Mukqs stuff, and hopefully performing more and more, so I'm looking forward to that. Also, there is definitely more music from me coming out in 2019, which represents stuff I made at the end of last year—the ""newest"" material that I have in the vault. Stoked for that, for sure.Tracklist:Mukqs “Love Machine” unreleased [2019]Nobukazu Takemura “Icefall” Scope [1999]Unknown Artist “Akazéhé Par Deux Jeunes Filles” Musique Du Burundi [1968]Puto Tito “Mestre Das Artes” Carregando A Vida Atrás Das Costas [2019]Nadah El Shazly “Afqid Adh-Dhakira (I Lose Memory)” Ahwar [2017]Dos Monos “Abdication b4 he dies” Dos City [2019]Lockbox “Spiral Incubus” Soundcloud loosie [2019]Kota Hoshino ""EG Expression II - Will” Evergrace OST [2009]Mukqs “A5 Demoloin (For Carl Stone)” unreleased [2019]Koeosaeme “Head” Sonorant [2017]Simulation “The Reverse Can Be Said” Death’s Head Speaks [2019]H Takahashi “Crystal” Escapism [2018]Elliott Sharp “Looppool” Looppool [1988]Doc Sleep “Baltic Amber” Your Ruling Planet [2019]W00DY “Hell” Relentless Kickdrum [2018]Container “Mottle” Soundcloud loosie [2019]Naoya Shimokawa “Piano and Guitar” White Album 2 OST [2013]Wednesday Campanella “Yaku No Jitsugetsubushi” Yakushima Treasure [2019]Jay Mitta “2015” Tatizo Pesa [2019]Khaki Blazer “Black Mesh” Optikk [2019]Mukqs “Stolas” unreleased [2019]Woopheadclrms “Beauty tattoo paper“ Asaga Fu an Fumoragu Aria [2019]Emamouse “ î~é╠ë╠” Eye Cavity [2019]Nuno Canavarro “Blu Terra” Mr. Wollogallu [1991]Pascale Project “Sexy Inc” Just Feel Good For A Moment [2015]Mukqs “For Diane” Mem Aleph [2019]Taeko Ohnuki “Sargasso Sea” Sunshower [1977]Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Max Allison', 'Good Willsmith', 'Earlier', 'Earlier', 'Sharkula', '""', 'Miles Davis', '""', '""', '""', '""', '""', 'Stoked', 'Takemura', 'Death’s Head Speaks', 'î~é', 'Mr. Wollogallu']"
"Photo by Kelia AnneEvery night, dreams find their way into our subconscious, creating a heightened sense of emotions linked to our memories. The ability to control your dreams, or lucid dream, provides a new sense of autonomy over those feelings. New York-based singer Raveena's debut album,  Lucid, evokes a similar sentiment. The album finds the 25-year-old singer using R&B and soul to parse through the trauma she repressed as a teenager. Raveena's SoundCloud is scattered with loosies that predate her soulful signature sound. In 2017, she released  Shanti, a 7-track that emphasized the practice of self-love. ""In order for us to advance, heal from intergenerational traumas, and reach our full potential as women of color, we have to recognize the importance of acts of self-care,"" she said in a Rookie interview last year. Two years later, the singer and producer Everett Orr have continued to handcraft their sound, drawing from influences like D'Angelo, Minnie Ripperton, and Stevie Wonder. ""We’re one unit and wanted to create this really cohesive universe you could escape to with our music,"" she told Noisey.   Lucid is Raveena and Orr's offering of a world that exists beyond pain. On the record, the singer examines the relationships that compromised her mental health (""Stronger"") and her physical space (""Salt Water""). Together, Raveena and Orr's greatest strength is translating intense lyrics about abuse (""I froze in a hot shower / I scrub away his sins"") across dreamy, synthy productions. ""Mama,"" the album's turning point, finds the singer looking inward at the women who raised her, before preparing to love again. Her 74-year-old grandmother even makes a cameo on ""Nani's Interlude,"" giving maternal words of wisdom. ""We should be thankful for every moment. [...] You will love this life more.""  A week before the release of  Lucid, the singer chatted with Noisey over the phone to share how it felt to relive the trauma of her past for her debut album.   Noisey: How would you describe your entry into music?Raveena: I was really introverted as a kid and fell in love with music. It was my main source of working shit out in my head and entertainment growing up. I fell in love with jazz and soul, and Billie Holiday. I listened to Ella Fitzgerald and all of those soul classics. I’d sing to myself in the bathroom for hours, studying how to use my voice and how to stretch it as an instrument. I moved to New York when I was 17. I worked with a bunch of producers and songwriters and I didn’t really find the right sound until I met Everett [Orr] when I was 21. He had this background in hip-hop and worked with people like Yo Gotti and DJ Khaled. He actually used a lot of soul samples in his beats. We fell in love over our mutual love for R&B and soul. The rest is history. We’ve been developing a sound together. We’re one unit and wanted to create this really cohesive universe you could escape to with our music.  How would you classify that universe?There’s purity from the heart and a childlike sense to that universe. It allows manifesting and pure feelings of love, kindness, and unity. We want music to be a space of healing for people. It’s also very vulnerable and meant to be somewhere you can express what you’ve been through freely—as a safe space. Escapism is a big part of our music as well. It’s ethereal and surreal.  You've recorded music before but consider   Lucid a debut album. What is it about   Lucid that feels more like an introduction to people who may not be familiar with you?A big goal of mine was to make a concept album—something you could listen to all the way through that flowed together well. It feels like a very complete body of work because it tells a story and there’s an arc, release, and resolution in the album. That’s a big way that [my music] grew. I pushed myself musically to explore different ranges of my voice and try out different songwriting methods. I even co-produced a song [""Petal""]. We both kind of were just pushing ourselves—Everett in his production and me in my songwriting. We finally landed somewhere where we really found ourselves. We found a sound that really takes all of our influences but delivers them in a way that’s completely ours.  Why did you decide to name the album   Lucid?To be lucid is clarity after a period of confusion. It sums up the story of the album really well. The first half is darker and sadder. I'm trying to figure myself out through all this pain, heartbreak, and trauma. The second half you feel a lot more clarity. You feel joy. The name alludes to the story that it’s telling.  “Nectar” feels like a continuation of  “Honey.” They’re both inherently sensual and sexy. What would you say is the correlation for you there?“Nectar” is a way more open version of “Honey.” I was really trying to assert my sexuality as a grown woman on that track, especially with lines like: “You’ve been missing my sunflower / Sunshower, I know.” I was envisioning myself as this free goddess and someone coming into that world. I love approaching sensuality and sexuality in a way that feels very empowering to the woman. Like you’re not doing it for anyone else’s pleasure than your own. You revel in your own beauty and sensuality and that’s completely for yourself. If you invite someone into that world that’s a treasure for them. It’s not like you’re putting on a show for the male gaze. I wanted to embody this woman who was very free and feminine but was just for herself.  “Stronger” is beautiful because you are detailing a toxic relationship but you still see yourself “holy as a sunrise.” Can you talk about the songwriting process on that song?That song was an intense song to write. I was going back into the place I was when I was a teenager when I was allowing myself to be used and abused by men. I didn’t really understand what that was doing to my body, but there was a little voice inside of me that was like “You’re worth something. You have to want better for yourself.” “Stronger” is about being in the worst place with yourself and this other person. The beautiful thing about being a human—and the strength of a woman especially—is the little voice telling you something about this situation isn’t right. You hear me getting stronger and more free as the song goes on.  The first couple of listens of ""Salt Water"" I thought, “Wow, this song sounds so pretty.” But the lyrics seem to be the most tied to physical trauma. You literally say, “I think my body’s had enough.” You said it was intense to write “Stronger,” but I would imagine that ""Salt Water"" would be harder to write?I’ve always wanted to write a song about being physically traumatized or in an abusive relationship. The feeling of the day after when you’re sitting there and feeling so raw and taken back and traumatized. I thought it was important to have a moment on the album about that because it’s a very hard thing to write about. I think the feeling of people wanting to shower that off is a pretty universal experience. It can be intense to listen to, but we tried to deliver it in a way that was also beautiful. If you hadn’t experienced [abuse] you could still appreciate [the song] for what it was.  It's so easy to forget that your parents are people who had identities before you came along. Coming into adulthood, especially as women, you realize a child may come into this world thinking your sole purpose is to be their mom. What was that instinct that made you see the humanity in your mother and your grandmother on ""Mama?""I always hear stories about my mom and grandma coming to America with the classic immigrant story. They actually escaped genocide in [India], so they were coming from a very traumatized place. My mom had me around 25, and I recognize how different my life is at this age compared to where she was at 25. Having a baby and having to go through everything she did in India, all while trying to figure herself out. I was in awe of her and I was like ""Wow if I was going through half of what she was going through, I don’t know how I’d deal with it on top of having a baby."" It trips you out. I don’t know if I’m ready for that yet.  [LAUGHS]“Mama” is the turning point of the album, and by “Floating” we find you ready to pick yourself back up and you’re reading to love again. Aside from using music as therapy, what would you say it took for you to get there?Using psychedelics I was able to access this childlike happiness again and this freedom from all my worries. I wanted to write a song about being in nature, being high, and seeing your lover and experiencing those really pure, overly joyous moments that help you get back into a place of normalcy again. I think it’s important for anyone who’s been through something to have time for that. Being able to be that free and experience freedom of your body and the freedom to love again is a form of self-care. It’s so important to the soul that you create space for those moments.  You’re 25 now and you said a lot of the abuse you suffered was as a teenager. Is there an age where you’d you say most of this trauma happened?I was pretty young. Most of it happened from 17 to 22. I’ve really been healing and rebuilding myself in the last three years. Everett really helped with that too. Being able to have somebody help me bring out all of the stories. They were stories I’d been wanting to tell forever, but sometimes it’s hard to find the right producer and the right person to open up to.  Everett is not only your producer but your partner too. It couldn’t have been easy on him watching you relive those moments.This album took a lot out of me because I was reliving the trauma. In between recording “Stronger,” “Salt Water,” and “Stone,” I would just cry. There were a lot of tears for this album, but I knew I had to tell my story from when I was younger.  The final song, ""Petal"" shows your evolution throughout the album. At the beginning of the album you say you're as heavy as a stone, but by the end are ""weightless."" How does it feel to get rid of the weight?This album feels like I'm really letting that part of myself truly go and let it be in the past. It's beautiful, I feel like I'm entering a new part of womanhood, and ""Petal"" is reflective of that. It's me having a birds-eye view on everything, and I love existentialism because it gives you perspective on all of your worries. On the song, I say: ""When I feel like I'm down / When I'm checking my phone"" You can be mad about some stupid email but at the end of the day you should be enjoying life like my grandma says. We have such little time on this Earth, why waste it?  Lucid was not just giving space to the sadness, but also realizing there's a time to let it go as well. Once you're ready you should step into this calm and peaceful version of yourself—maybe it's not today. It's a journey to recover from any kind of trauma, but you can end up happy in the end. You just need community and love and self-love to get you through it. Kristin Corry is a staff writer. Follow her on Twitter.

"Emotional Oranges exist in a murky, haze-filled, internet-driven reality of their own creation. The sultry, nighttime R&B group's affinity for The Weeknd, Sade and The XX fuses together in their sound, giving them a nostalgic, solemn feel, while they create an inescapable groove. ""We really wanted to blend hip hop 90s drum breaks—everything [DJ Premier] was doing, all the way to what Jay Z was doing with Kanye—blending that with 80s jazzy guitars,"" said the project's producer and singer, who Noisey is calling Emo for anonymity's sake. Emotional Oranges have managed to keep their identities secret, while building hype around a handful of singles, all of which were released over the course of the last year or so. Despite their anonymity, they communicate with fans directly every day, most often via Instagram message, carrying engaging dialogue with the ""citrus squad,"" as they refer to their followers. But that's as much of themselves as they're willing to give for now. There’s an entire cottage industry devoted to unearthing prolific artists whose work never reached the masses. Jackie Shane, Searching for Sugarman's Rodriguez, and Detroit's Death (not to be confused with the Florida death metal band, Death) all saw their work appreciated long after their respective artistic peaks.   But unlike these artists who mostly worked hard to have their music and identities known, Emotional Oranges know the power of a mysterious set of singles and a perfectly curated Instagram account (which references their influences like Daft Punk, The Weeknd, and Lauryn Hill, among others, while also creating an identity based on the color orange). ""We are trying to walk that line of like making music or art we love and also just be regular,"" Emo said. ""The anonymity is half to protect us from our normal lives... Let us be able to have girlfriends and eventually like, wives, kids,"" he continued.   Emotional Oranges’ story began four years ago, while individual members of the collective (who they are or how many people make up the group is unknown at this point) all worked regular jobs, some as songwriters and producers for other projects. ""If you listen real carefully, on our first single 'Motion,' that’s our first singer. She's an A&R at a big label. The rest of the songs are our new singer,"" Emo said, stressing just how much this collective is comprised of so-called ""normal"" people.   With their just-released EP,  The Juice Vol. 1 and a small but strategically consequential North American and European tour ahead of them (many dates are already sold out), Emotional Oranges' anonymity might not last forever. ""I guess people can come to the shows and see us, but we're not going to talk about who we are,"" Emo said.    The Juice Vol. 1 picks up where the band's gradual single release left off, offering a total of eight tracks including the singles they've released over the last year. Similar to the way The Weeknd built hype early in his career, the collective has created a mystique with each single drop. But Emotional Oranges' approach to songwriting leaves more room for earnest vulnerability tethered to a funky, disco-like breakbeat groove that guides their subdued vocals. The EP has equal parts clunky DFA style basslines, Adrian Utley-during-peak-Portishead-level-of-restraint guitars, and Drake-adjacent sentimentality.On ""Motion,"" their first and most popular single, the simple restraint carries steamy vocals signaling the arrival of the ideal intimate partner. ""Personal"" expands on the band’s musical abilities, showcasing the guitarist's penchant for creating nostalgic soundscapes, over a nu-disco beat. ""Good to Me"" reimagines The S.O.S. band's ""Just Be Good to Me"" for the internet age. ""It's got that [S.O.S. Band] disco energy, but you can give it that hip hop groove,"" Emo said. As Emo spoke about the project that's been four years in the making, he couldn't help but let moments of unrestrained enthusiasm seep in. ""We've all worked regular jobs. We're very regular people. And we came together for one unified vision. I tried a lot of things in my life that didn't work. I tried to put so many things together. It just came down to authenticity. I think we spent like $7,000 mixing this record and that's it. Everything else was just us. This rehearsal space cost 60 bucks, and we’re in here jamming. That’s the beauty of it to us.""

"Photo courtesy of the artistOver the last few years, the French composer Félicia Atkinson’s work has softened a bit. The records she’s made over the last decade have often been jagged assemblages of abstract sound—jigsaw puzzles with edges as sharp as knives—but she’s slowly changed her approach to favor more gentle moments, more melody, and soothing whispered poetry. This shift, she told me back in 2017, is by design. As the world has become a more chaotic place, she felt less of a need to add to the din. “I felt collapsed by the terrorist attacks, by the election of Trump, by Syria, by all this sadness,” she said. “I wanted to make a record that was more calm, I couldn't bear more violence in a way.”Since then, she’s largely continued along that track. Her 2018 cassette  Coyotes drew on the fluid placidity of Japanese environmental music, and leaned heavily on the peaceful tones of the Fender Rhodes. On July 8, Atkinson will release a new album called  The Flower & The Vessel, which adds new dimensions to her interest in bliss. Recorded, per a press release, in “impersonal hotel rooms” while on tour, the record is a movement of slow movements and subtle gestures befitting the bubble-like existence of that life. On tour, you sort of never really adjust to being in one place or another, living for days, weeks, or months in this strange purgatory of in-between spaces. The dreary piano lines and synth drones evoke those long, lonely distances, evoking both the anxiety and the solitude of the road. Today, Atkinson is sharing the eight-minute piece “Moderato Cantabile,” which illustrates some of the new emotional places she’s exploring on the record. It’s largely built around these meandering piano lines, which swell occasionally out of a sea of chittering electronics and manipulated found sounds that feel like crying livestock. There’s not a lot of melodic movement, but the mood is evocative. It’s calm, sure, but in this somber and sparse way. There’s yearning and desperation baked into it, despite the fact that its one of the few tracks on the record that doesn’t feature Atkinson’s voice. The feelings are all implied, but they’re there. Elsewhere, the record has its moments of disorientation and disjunct. Atkinson will likely never fully abandon the stress of her earliest work, but this side of her work lands easier now when its surrounded by moments of stillness. It makes sense, because that’s how the world works right? Even when you’re able to create an oasis for yourself, sometimes the chaos creeps in.

"Spam paintin submitted via Twitter / Fridge via ThatFyeWhiteGuy on Twitter Every month we open the floodgates to the plebs on Twitter, inviting you send us whatever you want us to review. It always goes super well and you've definitely never sent us anything gross or illegal. Well guess what, we have a new website now, so Colin Joyce, Trey Smith, and Drew Schwartz were tasked with wading through all the muck you sickos have stored on your hard drives. Except, wait, you actually sent us some good music this time? That can't be right. Colin: The only Marvel movies I've seen are  Black Panther and  Ant-Man, so I'm pretty afraid that I've accidentally introduced some  Endgame spoilers here off the bat. Are people going to beat me up? Should we blur this picture?Drew: I think we just lean into it. As someone who's seen  Endgame, I can say with authority that this is, in fact, the way the whole thing ends. Thanos turns into a mouse, and then he uses the Infinity Stones to transform every living being into a mouse, and the movie basically just becomes Marvel’s version of  The Rescuers. Sorry, everybody. Don't blame us for ruining it—blame Twitter user Marcux Brown.Trey: This is how Stuart Little should have ended too.Drew: Truly remarkable. The suspense at the beginning here is riveting; the slow trot of the dog promising; the abrupt tonal shift and rapid acceleration deeply satisfying, and deeply, deeply weird. I’m also impressed with how whoever engineered this whole thing kept that fake baby from falling off the dog, and kept the fake baby's cig from flying out of its mouth. Ten out of ten.Colin: The Kentucky Derby looks so much different than I remember.  Trey: The soundtrack. The way the doll's head is shaking. The fact that there is more than one good boy in here. Give this all the Oscars.(On a more serious note greyhound racing is super messed up and adopting dogs is always a good idea.)Colin: I would never besmirch the name of one of the most influential rappers of a generation, but I don't know how you could come away from this convinced that Soulja Boy has ever seen any anime at all. He claims to be like ""Cowboy Bebop"" when he's ""blastin'"" but clearly he should know that the character's name is Spike? Drew: I like the part where Soulja Boy starts listing characters from  Dragon Ball Z, and then just gives up really quickly: ""I'm lookin' like Vegeta man / lookin' like Gohan / lookin' like Piccolo / lookin' like anime."" I, too, am convinced that Soulja Boy is a fraud in this department.Trey: Rappers lie all the time. Who cares? This slaps. Colin: Oh yeah, this is definitely one of the best Soulja songs. This and the one where he said ""fuck all the army troops.""Colin: Honestly this is really sick. You would've killed in a Captured Tracks band circa 2011. Maybe you could still join Hoop Dreams? Are they still a band?Drew: Unfortunately they are not, but yes—this song rips, and Ali does, as advertised, shred. I would easily put this on first thing in the morning, or listen to it in the rain at dusk, chain-smoking cigarettes on a screen porch somewhere. Nice and mellow. Trey: This song makes me feel like Rory Gilmore and I don't know how I feel about that, but this does, in fact, kick ass and would listen to it again.Colin: I know the whole ""Africa"" thing was at least partly our fault, but we're long past the age of innocence where such a kitschy track could be even remotely funny. Give me Dobby dancing to  Merzbeat instead. Drew: Yeah, I’m over ""Africa,"" over pretending it's the best song ever written, over the covers and the thinkpieces and the unceasing barrage of ironic jokes. And yet I find myself unable to stop watching this video. I’ve seen it like twelve times at this point. Dancing Dobby is at once terrifying and mesmerizing—so wrong, and yet so, so right. I hate him. I love him. I can’t look away.Trey: Read another book.Drew: Muffled sobbing, constant screaming, a nauseatingly close crop on Anthony Fantano's face—all disturbing stuff. I'm going back to watching Dobby dance, only now I’m going to mute ""Africa"" and play that song by Ali Shreds, which somehow compliments this video perfectly?Colin: Ok so, I like this, but the central premise of your song is totally wrong. The internet's busiest melon lives for blown-out, scream-rap garbage. But then, we both know you were just trying to get him to tweet your track by making the song about him. No need to do that friend, you deserve better than pandering to YouTubers. Trey: This sounds like it was designed for teens to mosh to so it definitely isn't for me, but I can definitely see the appeal here. Colin: While I appreciate the industrial quantities of pickled vegetables you have in the door, we can't ignore that meat is murder. Also, that's a lotta old takeout in there. Throw it away, you're never going to eat it, I promise. Drew: Way, way too much takeout. If you don't get rid of it soon, your fridge is going to start smelling all weird, and you'll contaminate the rest of your food with the stench of two-week-old shrimp fried rice and moldy chicken tenders, or whatever the hell it is you have in there. I would ordinarily give this fridge, like, a D—but judging from the Monday Night beer in the door (bottom right corner) and what looks like Publix brand lunch meat on the shelf, I’m going to guess that you live in Atlanta, my hometown, a splendid city. For that, I bump this fridge up to a C+.Colin: Mmm Publix. Yeah toss those leftovers and go get a sub on their multigrain bread. Trey: ""Oh look at us, Colin and Drew, the fridge experts.""Don’t listen to them, Twitter user ThatFyeWhiteGuy. This is a perfectly adequate fridge and it looks like you're ready for many quick cravings that could come your way. I don't know why they assume that your takeout is old but I won't disrespect you like that. You need some more fruits and vegetables in there but otherwise you're fine.Drew: This dog slaps. Look at his ears! So long, so floppy, so visibly soft. Look at his eyes—the way they're spaced just a touch too far apart, so it looks like he’s staring off in two different directions. And then, of course, the doggie Stetson, kerchief, and sheriff's badge, a look that suits him nicely. Who's a good boy? You are! Yes you  are! Colin: I think technically this dog is a cop, which means I can't get down with them, sorry. Trey: It's not the dog's faults that cops make them be cops. Full marks to this good boy.Colin: Ahh I'm such a sucker for nylon-stringed acoustic guitars there's something about them that's just so peaceful. This song is like a warm hug—it's really hard to be mad at, even with a heart as cold as mine.Drew: Her voice is really nice too, those whispery, almost jazzy harmonies. And I like that the arrangement here stays simple throughout; the song builds, but you never get ripped out of the placid, lovely little world you’re transported to. What is that, two good songs already? How is this happening?Trey: This song feels like smoking a cigarette after a long meeting and that’s the highest compliment that I can pay it.Colin: It's got kind of a ""Friendship ended with Mudasir"" vibe. Now dog food is my best friend. Drew: Accurate assessment, Colin. It's wild to think that someone ostensibly got paid to design this label. The fish-meat fill in the lettering for ""Salmon"" is disturbing. I was also very confused by the age thing. This dog food is 27 years old, but it's also 24 years old? Either way, you're advertising that fact? Then I got to the last photo, and my questions were answered, though there’s no chance either of those dogs are in their twenties.Trey: If someone packaged people food like this I would only buy that brand. Drew: Given how unbelievably depressing the new Toy Story looks, I wouldn't be surprised if this was a legitimate still from the movie. Gather round, kids, and watch as Woody masochistically pays for all the world's sins with his life! Can’t wait for the next installment in this series,  Toy Story 5: Woody Is Risen.Colin:  Toy Story kind of is a messianic tale. But I would have pegged Hamm as the Christ figure. Think about it.Trey:Colin: This sounds nice, it's just a bit horny for my tastes. Like, we get it, you've had sex one time! Good for you!Drew: Yeah, the production is honestly pretty tight, and these voices pair well together. But then you had to go and just explicitly say ""I want to bang"" over and over again. There's nothing wrong with songs that are fully about having sex when the writing is good—see Elle Varner’s ""Soundproof Room""—but on this, I'm afraid, it is not.Trey: I've never had sex before so I can’t relate to this song, but it sounds great.Colin: Legitimately not used to getting so much competent music in this feature. Some lovely sample twisting here and a grave meditation on morality. A ScHoolboy Q track is autoplaying for me on YouTube after this, which is honestly pretty appropriate company. Drew: It's a dark song, but it's not too heavy-handed. The fact that these lyrics are so difficult to discern initially threw me off, but as soon as I caught a few powerful snatches—notably, ""white man want me on the sycamore tree""—it made me want to take a closer listen. The production is crisp, the writing is strong, Saint-Godfrey’s voice is rich and textured, and he’s got nice flow. Solid stuff.Trey: Yeah you all did a great job with the music submissions this time around. I like this a lot because you can tell that a lot of thought and care went into this song, but you managed to sound pretty effortless on it. Sounds familiar and different at the same time. Post more please.Drew: I expected this song to be a joke. Turns out it's, uh, weirdly serious and vaguely sad? I also have a hard time wrapping my head around the idea of crypto making anyone’s ""panties drop,"" it is literally the least sexy thing in existence.Colin: Finally, an anthem for your weird roommate who owns multiple (?) Ron Paul t-shirts. This is gonna be a hit on Reddit! Trey: This is what people think Elon Musk feels like when he wakes up in the morning but I bet it’s actually a lot heavier on the self-loathing.Drew: I have never personally eaten Spam, but it seems gross and just generally wrong. That said, this painting is fine, I guess? I am confused as to why you chose Spam, of all things, as your subject. Also, are those two identical paintings of Spam below it, combining into some kind of bizarre Spam triptych? If so, why? Who has time for that?Colin: Ah, more meat content. See above re: murder, etc. Trey: Oh so you all are art AND Fridge experts now? Spam is tight and its cultural and historic impacts are not appreciated enough. This painting is dope. I like the light around the can and the way all the colors work with each other. They need to take this out of your kitchen and put it in the MoMA. Nice work.Colin: Yeah Drew, Spam's all over the world cause of American military imperialism. You can read about it on this very website, duh.Drew: Whatever, man.

"Every week, the Noisey staff puts together a list of the best and most important albums, mixtapes, and EPs from the past seven days. Sometimes it includes projects we’ve written about on the site already; sometimes it's just made up of great records that we want everyone to hear, but never got the chance to write about. The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.Here Comes The CowboyAs Mac Demarco’s popularity has grown over the past 7 years, his albums have gotten more restrained and bare-bones. The ease and simplicity with which he writes songs has been his strongest asset, one that makes his modest fourth LP  Here Comes The Cowboy a compelling albeit low-stakes listen. Though much of the conversation surrounding this album has been a trumped up “controversy” about whether he copied a similarly titled yee-haw-minded Mitski full-length, the actual songs deserve closer attention. The opener title track settles into a bluesy amble while delightfully goofy “Choo Choo” chugs along with several nods to Haruomi Hosono. There’s a casual warmth and familiarity with Demarco’s voice that also makes for some resonant moments on the LP’s most stellar songs like “Finally Alone” and “All of My Yesterdays.” This may not be his fans' immediate favorite, but there are enough inviting and ramshackle tunes to make this a grower. —Josh TerryLEGACY! LEGACY!For the past few years, Jamila Woods has been wrestling with how to prevent the legacy of individuals like Nipsey [Hussle] from disappearing. To that end, she decided to pay homage to a different Black creator on each of the album's 13 tracks, summoning the energy of poets, musicians, and writers whose fingerprints can be found all over her stirring resistance songs. The track-list reads like a roll call, with names like ""ZORA,"" ""EARTHA,"" and ""MILES"" marking themselves present. It's an example of the magic that happens when the careers of Black people are given the grace of eternal life.—Kristin Corry, “Jamila Woods Wants You to Stop Rewriting Black History”Sli’merreYoung Nudy goes expensive but tasteful on this full-length collab with producer Pi’erre Bourne, himself known for grimy contributions to the catalogs of Playboi Carti and Lil Uzi Vert. Across 12 tracks, Nudy flexes and contorts his voice over shimmery Bourne beats. That’d be enough on its own, but he also has a couple bright guest spots from old buds like Uzi, his cousin (!) 21 Savage, and some of rap’s rising stars, DaBaby and Megan Thee Stallion. The best moments come low-slung and heavy-lidded, like “Black Hippie, White Hipster” on which Nudy professes a love for big-ass blunts amid some catchy threats: “Your mama find you on the news.” Maybe he is a slimeball after all.  —Colin JoyceShea Butter BabyAs Dreamville's first woman signee, Ari Lennox is no stranger to the ways the music industry can be seen as a ""boys' club."" On the opener to her debut album, ""Chicago Boy,"" Lennox has a directive for any men who may be listening: ""[...]Leave, please. On the count of three, because I need to talk to my bitches."" From then on,  Shea Butter Baby is as intimate as girl talk, with Lennox journeying through the milestones of adulthood, celebrating the freedom of walking around naked on ""New Apartment"" and penny-pinching on ""Broke."" Following her provocative 2016 single ""Backseat,"" Lennox fills  Shea Butter Baby with moments of sensuality—both subtly and explicitly. You can expect the acronym ""BMO"" to permeate the text threads for your summer shenanigans. ""Break me off / That gitchy gitchy yaya when the lights is off,"" she sings on the Total-inspired song.  Shea Butter Baby cements Lennox's voice as a leading voice of R&B's new class. —Kristin CorryPROTOFor her PhD thesis, Herndon—alongside her partner and collaborator, the philosopher and digital artist Mat Dryhurst, as well as artist and software developer Jules LaPlace—built and trained an AI named Spawn to make music. It took a minute to figure out the best technique, but they finally landed on a voice-modeling approach. First, Herndon and Dryhurst trained Spawn on their voices, and then they invited a “willing public” of about 300 people to perform and record what would be a data set of vocals to feed the AI. The artists Martine Syms, Jenna Sutela, Jlin, Colin Self, Evelyn Saylor, and Annie Garlid also contributed to the making of  PROTO. Herndon calls this group of participants “the ensemble.” The resulting work is sometimes eerie, but more often rhapsodic and choral. Its roots are digital, but it's exuberantly primal. —Leah Mandel, “Holly Herndon's New, AI-Spawned Album Is Full of Humanity” My FaceLike their solo works, this collaboration between the boundary-pushing producers Mechatok and Toxe is emotive, dramatic, and full of high-gloss sounds warping and rending around one another. The big surprise, I guess, is just how...pleasant it is. It’s full of the experimental contortions you’d expect from them, but it doesn’t overshadow any of the luminescence that gleams off of these brilliant synthetics. “SXF” revolves around a pretty classic rave energy, lighting up the dancefloor in a wondrous neon. It’s pure pleasure stuff—which we all need sometimes.  —Colin JoyceA Gaze Among ThemLoud and slow and dramatic enough to share stages with Sunn O))), this Montreal trio rachets up the drama on their fourth album,  A Gaze Among Them. It consists of five weighty tracks (only one is shorter than seven minutes) each of which drone and repeat in the mystic way you might expect had you plumbed the inky pits of their past releases. But what’s most stunning about  A Gaze Among Them is how vast and varied the environments they create are. Thunderous bass riffs and guitar squeals tear upwards out of the dusty ground like the mesas and chasms of the American west. If you look at it from a distance, it seems like a wide-open expanse, but it juts out in unexpected ways. Be careful out there.  —Colin JoyceYoung EnoughCharly Bliss’ songs have always been bright and irresistible, loaded with hooks and rough-edged wit. But on the band’s slick and sunny sophomore album  Young Enough, they’ve ditched the pop-punk fuzz of their debut  Guppy for something more polished and soaring. Even without the grungy presentation, the Brooklyn quartet have always been a pop band at heart and here they enthusiastically lean into sugared melodies and big, arena-sized choruses. But even though the production values are ramped up, these songs still have bite. “Chatroom” cathartically and directly deals with the trauma of sexual assault, while single “Hard To Believe” is an anthemic kiss off to toxic relationships.  —Josh TerryFull Moon, Heavy LightFor Full Moon, Heavy Light, Ona picks apart the formula they started with, ditching their inside joke of ""What Would Neil Young Do?"" for a warmer and less orthodox sound. As they became a more polished live band, landing tours opening for [Tyler] Childers as well as Ohio’s Caamp, their songs spread out and settled into a groove...At its core,  Full Moon, Heavy Light is full of breezy and wistful songs. Take the single ""Young Forever."" The track is moonlit and nostalgic, showcasing the band's newest member, keyboardist Brad Goodall, giving the song twinkling nuance and Jenkins assuringly singing, ""If I messed you up, if I made you cry / I know you’ll carry on."" The song builds to a romantic organ-led crescendo, complete with an extended guitar solo jam that never seems gratuitous. —Josh Terry, “Ona Could Be the Next Great Rock Band.” Sombrou DúvidaBrazil’s Boogarins make psychedelic rock that feels fresh, innovative, and alive in 2019. They’re not content to recycle grooves from the past on their new album  Sombrou Dúvida, a forward-thinking and fun collection. The songs here unpredictably expand and contract, like the slinking single “Invenção,” the year’s most colorful and exciting offering from the genre. Elsewhere, guitars patiently swirl over the slow burning “Desandar.” Elsewhere, the tracks hit with intensity like the climactic and atmospheric “Dislexia.” There’s a curiosity that seeps into the way the band meticulously constructs their songs, which results in the LP being their the most cinematic and impressive full-length yet.  —Josh TerryAnoyoTim Hecker’s 2018  Konoyo was a burning car crash, radiating a melted heat that felt both ambient and jarring. It’s beautiful in the way harsh things so often are, a desperate claim of humanity unfurling over seven extended tracks.  Anoyo, the album’s companion follow-up, turns the entire method inwards, stripping elements with calculated abandon—a radical minimalism that moves from barely-registered whispers to instrumental yelps. Anoyo is noisy, but not recklessly. Tim Hecker is as much a scientist as he is a musician, unflinchingly precise with every note and tool he accesses.  Anoyo is another entry in one of the most ecstatic and exciting discographies in electronic music, a collection of records that move from raucous and broken to dreamy and melodic.  Anoyo is all of those things at once. —Will SchubeWaterThe promise of [Dehd's] first two releases has culminated in their electric debut album,  Water. It’s not just that the 13 songs are their most confident and seamless yet; the LP’s mere existence is a triumph, because it came out of the Kempf and Balla’s messy breakup...While  Water comes out of the ashes of romance, it's so optimistic and hopeful that it feels wrong to even call it a breakup album. Dehd's melodies have the same breezy and pop-minded feel of '60s girl groups, but performed by a raucous DIY punk band. Lead single ""Lucky"" nostalgically swoons with plenty of jangle as Kempf croons, ""Is this the end shalalalala?"" —Josh Terry, ""Chicago's Dehd Made an Optimistic Album Out of a Messy Breakup.""

"Photo by Dakota SillymanSpencer Radcliffe uses his open indie rock songs as a way of searching. You can hear it on songs like ""Clocktower,"" on which he hopes ""for some time alone to clear my thoughts and unwind."" But it's really throughout his catalog—even in the ambient pieces he's made under another moniker, Blithe Field. There's just a sense that he's always trying to untangle something complex.In conversation, the Chicago-via-Ohio songwriter matched his patiently folksy music, often dealing in long pauses and several qualifiers to fully make his point. “I'm definitely someone who will say things intentionally but then think about them too long if I have an opportunity to go back and adjust or update them later with whoever I said them to,” he said over the phone. Though that might not make interviews his favorite activity, it does make him one of the most thoughtful active songwriters. His albums have always been an inquisitive look at the mundanity of everyday life that chuckle back with a dark joke or a biting observation.2017’s  Enjoy The Great Outdoors was his debut as Spencer Radcliffe and Everyone Else, where he led a full band that gave his previously solitary songs, like the ones on his his 2015 breakthrough  Looking In, a meatier backbone. His newest LP with the band,  Hot Spring, which is premiering below, is his most cohesive collection yet. It’s a brightly arranged and meticulously pieced-together 10 song effort that boasts silky pedal steel from new Everyone Else member Pat Lyons. “For the last record, we were figuring out as a new band how to make 10 diverse songs that would sound good together. But this time since we’d been playing together much longer the LP was a more natural product of playing together,” explained Radcliffe. A wonderfully left-of-center “Field Guide” in the press release for Hot Spring called the follow-up “a sequel of sorts” to the prodding, open-range headspace of  Enjoy The Great Outdoors. “As much as I strive to not make the same thing twice and try to mix it up,"" Radcliffe admits. ""It just builds upon some of the ideas from the previous record and approaches them with the viewpoint you get when you've had more time to think about those things.” Take opener “The Birds,” the first song Radcliffe wrote for the LP, which kicks off a gorgeous burst of cello, pedal steel, and acoustic guitar. He sings on the track, “So all the bugs in the dirt, digging it down to Earth, can ride on / To all the bugs in the dirt, living for what it’s worth—right on.” Repetition has long been a facet of Radcliffe’s songs, evidenced his unsettlingly monotonous delivery on  Enjoy the Great Outdoors highlight “Slamming On The Brakes,” where he opened with “Doe / A deer / A female deer / Crashing through the windshield, lips dry, eyes peeled.”  Hot Spring treads similar ground like on “No Money,” where he also references universally popular songs, singing, “I’ve been dancing in the dark / I’ve been running down a dream / I’ve been running up that hill, but floating back down in a stream.” “At least on this record, a recurring theme it's concerned with is just trying to observe the way that you're going about living and existing,"" he explained. ""Sometimes you feel like you’re doing the same thing over and over again and getting the same result.” Radcliffe primarily concerned himself with how to live throughout  Hot Spring. Standout “Floss For The Future” encapsulates these existential conundrums with deadpan humor. The song finds asking a dentist whether or not flossing actually matters or if it’s “just a myth from my youth” to which he sings her reply, “She said: ‘Needle it through, pull it too, you know you’ve got to do what they tell you to—floss.’” There’s a sense no matter what’s best, it’s easy to still get stuck. He explained of the track, “You want to feel like you're doing things the right way. This deals with the implications of that and I think that's why I ended up being funny because I think it's a funny thing.” The stunningly pastoral arrangements on  Hot Spring transcend the anxiety-laced malaise throughout. The plaintive “Here Comes The Snow” gorgeously ambles to make for one of Radcliffe’s most beautiful songs yet especially when he sings, “Some people do the dance with death just to learn how to live.” Though the pedal steel and the guitars echo the touchstones of Cosmic American Music, the LP is hardly a country album. Single “Bloodletting” belies its pretty composition, full of lush strings and Lyons’ wailing pedal steel as Radcliffe sings, “Missiles dancing in the clouds that waterboarded roofs below / Peace and love were nice while they lasted, but now it’s time to lock and load. “ These aren’t literal battlefields Radcliffe sings about. As he was about sign off on the phone conversation, he mentions finding his dad’s copy of Walt Whitman’s  Leaves of Grass and reading the line from his poem ""As I Ponder'd In Silence,” “Know'st thou not there is but one theme for ever-enduring bards? / And that is the theme of War, the fortune of battles.”He took one more long pause and said, “I had never read any Walt Whitman but he's talking about how he's thinking about all those things even though he's singing about every day life stuff. It's funny. It's a similar thing because I try to make my music for the normal-ass people doing real world shit.”Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['""Clocktower', 'Blithe Field', 'Everyone Else', 'Hot Spring', 'Everyone Else', 'Pat Lyons', 'Hot Spring', 'Repetition', 'Radcliffe’s', 'Hot Spring', 'Hot Spring', 'Hot Spring', 'Radcliffe’s', 'Walt Whitman’s']"

The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.Apollo XXIThe young genius of fractured funk and reverberant R&B emerges boldly his debut full-length. After the short, swooning ""Only If,"" Steve Lacy launches into a 9-minute collection of vignettes called “Like Me” about working to accept himself as he is, which is to say fluid (""I only feel energy / I see no gender""). The record only opens up from there, presenting complicated emotions inside colorful arrangements. Let's just leave it at that; the record seems far too layered, complex, and vibrant to glean much more from Friday morning listening alone. This is one you’ll want to live with.  —Colin JoyceFlamagra Flamagra arrives amid a particularly chaotic time in Ellison's life. It's been five years since the release of his last record, the contortionist-jazz, dark-comedy  You're Dead! A lot has happened in the interim period. He directed his first feature film—a mind-bending body horror called  Kuso, for which he also did the soundtrack—and produced  Drunk, the latest psych-funk record from his good friend and frequent collaborator Thundercat. The stress of doing both projects at the same time almost ""broke"" him. The world has started to feel ever more apocalyptic—he watched a fire tear through the hills near his house in L.A. in a way that felt like something out of a disaster movie. His good friend Mac Miller died in September of last year.It's been an overwhelming period, and the record reflects that. There are no direct comparisons elsewhere in Flying Lotus' catalog, but it's run through with anxious energy and attention to detail that informed both  You're Dead! and his 2010 masterwork  Cosmogramma. He bounds valiantly between cosmic jazz riffs like ""Remind U?"" to delirious funk and bruising rap tracks. Throughout, he's aided by famous friends from across the musical spectrum, including Solange, Toro y Moi, Tierra Whack, and Anderson .Paak. It's jittery and unsettling, in the way you might expect from a record that takes its title and subject matter from fire. — Colin Joyce,  “Flying Lotus Ranks His Records”4REAL 4REALYG is at his best when he's committed to telling a story. His fourth studio album, 4REAL 4REAL, is a continuation of the narratives he introduced on albums like My Krazy Life and Still Brazy. He's mockingly poetic on the intro, but YG's messaging on 4REAL 4REAL isn't delivered haphazardly. The stories that are the most poignant show up on ""Her Story"" and ""Keisha Had a Baby,"" two stories centered around a woman's perspective. ""Keisha Had a Baby"" evokes the energy of Tupac's 1991 song, ""Brenda's Got a Baby,"" but details how children often keep people trapped in dysfunctional relationships. When 4REAL 4REAL departs from YG's storytelling, he's playing nice with a handful of collaborators—as many as two or three on a track. Standout ""I Was On The Block"" finds the rapper slow creeping with Valee and Boogie, for a track that is as laid back as it is hectic. —Kristin CorryWe Get ByMavis Staples is one of most enduring and essential figures in American music and her latter-day career has found her rejuvenated thanks to working with producers like Jeff Tweedy and M. Ward. For her latest, the excellent and prescient  We Get By finds her teaming with producer Ben Harper to make resonant songs about freedom, love, and friendship. The politically-charged ""Change"" finds her singing “What good is freedom / If we haven't learned to be free?"" Elsewhere, she turns nostalgic on the heartfelt ""Never Needed Anyone,"" when she croons, ""Started over many times / now I’m paying the cost."" She turns 80 this summer but her voice is as rich and powerful as she was with the Staples Singers or backing the Band in  The Last Waltz. — Josh Terry.Atlanta Millionaires ClubFaye Webster’s third album, Atlanta Millionaires, exceeds the promise of the Georgia native’s intimate brand of pop-Americana for one of the most fully formed LPs of 2019. While gorgeous pedal steel and a compelling twang color the arrangements, her strong songs are malleable and universal to be confined to the genre tag of country music. Originally signed to Awful Records before hopping on Secretly Canadian, Webster has always seamlessly jumped between worlds, providing guest vocals on songs from several Atlanta hip-hop artists like Lil Yachty and Father. The latter guests on highlight ""Come To Atlanta,"" a left-field move, on paper, for a folk record but it's more than an organic collaboration on the recording. There are few LPs as effortlessly confident out this year. — Josh TerryPaintedRecorded, per  Billboard, at the end of a long period of couch-surfing and trying to ""keep his head above water,"" Lucky Daye's debut album of kaleidoscopic funk and R&B sounds, paradoxically, exceptionally rich. Tracks like ""Karma"" are full of these immaculately stacked harmonies and lushly orchestrated instrumentation. Throughout Lucky and his primary collaborator—producer Dernst ""D'mile"" Emile—craft this impossibly vibrant, overstuffed and expensive-sounding combo of glimmering melodies and complex studio trickery. That it was done on a shoestring budget only makes it even more impressive—it's proof that true originals will always find a way to make their voices heard.  —Colin JoyceRewardFor an artist who works in isolation, Cate Le Bon makes surprisingly lush and welcoming music. She opens up grandly throughout her fifth studio album  Reward. To flesh out the LP, the Los Angeles resident decamped to northwest England, took a course in furniture making, and wrote songs at night on piano. The result is a densely-orchestrated and thrilling work, with songs that radiate hypnotic energy like the pulsing ""The Light"" and the swooning ""Home To You."" Kurt Vile assists on highlight ""Magnificent Gestures,"" a knotty, off-kilter jam that finds Le Bon singing, ""The mood escapes me / And I am writing it down."" It’s a mission statement for the entire album, a snapshot of how solitude can turn into revelation. — Josh Terry. Am I Am I, as its title suggests, allows former LVL UP member Mike Caridi the space to explore a lot of open-ended questions, consider the past, to figure out who he is in this new space. The title, he says, came to him after he’d finished the record, when he sat down and wrote out all the lyrics and realized that these sorts of questions were all over it: ""Am I good? Am I alone? Am I capable?""""I tend to question myself a lot of the time,"" Caridi says. ""Life decisions I'm making, and so on. I've found it helpful and healthy to question myself. I want to be self aware, and to understand myself and why I make whatever decisions I make."" —Colin Joyce,  “The Glow’s Fuzzy Debut Album Ponders the Big Questions”SauropodaL'Eclair would like for you to know as little as possible about their new album,  Sauropoda. It's the Swiss group’s second, this much we're sure of, but aside from basic facts, the music is the only clue. It was recorded over two days but there's no rush to the album's 37 minutes. These are deep grooves that move patiently from Italian film scores circa the ‘70s to library music and '90s Grateful Dead. These are less songs than slow transitions unconcerned with such narrative formalities as ""beginnings"" and ""ends.""There's a little bit of everything, and with the way these tracks expand, you're likely to find a transcendent moment every few minutes. The band has seven members, but that doesn't really mean anything, either. Yavor Lilov, for instance, plays three instruments: the Kicker's Delight, the Endless Kick, and the Bronto Kick. I'm no expert, but I don't think those are real instruments. So much about L'Eclair is beyond belief or understanding. The music has no choice but to do the work for the mysteries surrounding the group. —Will SchubeFalawThe Malian artist Luka Productions debuted in 2017 with  Fasokan a collection of kosmische synth work and reedy folk instrumentation. It was full of these circuitous, shimmering melodies, echoing insistently like mantras. It got compared to new age music a lot, which makes sense on one hand, Luka’s music did have the same sort of sighing cosmic quality. But the follow-up  Falaw illustrates that there was always a lot more going on. He opens up his world a lot here, both in sound and style—refining those electronic gasps into more pop directions and folding in even more organic instruments (peep the lovelorn and elastic guitar work on ""Bbni""). Luka had already proven himself capable of beautiful abstractions, but  Falaw shows he can focus too.  —Colin JoyceSign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Apollo XXIThe', 'Steve Lacy', 'Drunk', 'Thundercat', '""', 'Solange', 'Toro y Moi', 'Tierra Whack', 'Tupac', 'Jeff Tweedy', 'The Last Waltz', 'Father', 'Throughout Lucky', 'Colin', 'Cate Le Bon', '""', 'Sauropoda', '""', 'Endless Kick', 'Luka Productions', 'Luka’s', 'Falaw', 'Falaw']"
"Screenshot from ""Up Late""There are parts of your childhood that stick with you no matter how small the detail. You can still feel the pinch of your chin getting caught between the zipper of your winter jacket, and recall the skinned knees that bled through the bandaid. For many, shea butter (or Vaseline—whichever was in close proximity) holds a similar memory. A mother's love was shown in the slathered faces of youngsters in transit during brutal winters. Shea butter, a staple in Black households, is tough enough to prevent aging but soft enough to protect the kinks and curls of Black hair. It soils sheets, pillowcases, and car windows—the grease stains disclosing those who grew up on it, or the ""shea butter babies,"" as Ari Lennox, the only woman vocalist on J. Cole's Dreamville label, often says. The phrase materialized into the title of Lennox's debut album, released last Tuesday, and like the salve, Shea Butter Baby resonates long after its use. Today, the singer is releasing the visual for ""Up Late,"" a jazzy single from her debut that tells the story of a love drunken night. On the track, the Dreamville singer makes a late night rendezvous sound poetic. She's kissing ""lips dipped in Backwood tips"" and isn't too good for Target lingerie. The imagery on ""Up Late"" is strongest when she gets to the outro: Fifth floor, give your ass a duplicate fob, yeah / Fifth floor, devour that body like corn on the cob, yeah / Fifth floor, the neighbors must be questioning my job, yeah / Five a.m., could you stay a little longerThe visuals for ""Up Late"" don't sport the late night creeping you might have envisioned. There are no neighbors, no spare keys, and no corn on the cob (figuratively or literally). Instead, Lennox is transported to the middle of a field, with no one else but Masego accompanying her with his saxophone. For a song that is so inherently sexy, Lennox's choice to center herself is exactly what we needed. Kristin Corry is a staff writer. Follow her on Twitter.

"Photo by Jinni J. Christelle Bofale’s songs move like water. The San Antonio-born, Austin-based songwriter doesn’t have much released music to her name yet, but what has come out is extraordinary. It flows unpredictably, swirling delicately like the puddles that form along the shoreline, or rushing dangerously from melody to melody like a riptide. Verses and choruses exist, but the boundaries are blurry, and she seems more keen on the swells and emotional moments that come in between established structures. She said this feeling is intentional; drawing in part on the Congolese music she heard growing up, she is making music that is consciously boundless.  “It's not uncommon for Congolese songs to run for a really long time,” Bofale said. “There's no telling what could happen; it can sometimes feel like three or four songs in one song without feeling directionless.” What we conceive of as pop music, she explained, traditionally exists in opposition to that idea. You say what you need to say in three or four minutes and then you’re out. Instead, Bofale luxuriates in her songs. “In the music I listened to growing up, instead of expressing yourself in a short amount of time, you bask in the feeling of it for as long as possible,” she said. “It's a slow but palpable burn. It's almost as if you're trying to create what forever sounds like.” You can hear that spirit in songs like “U Ouchea,” the first single released from her debut EP  Swim Team, out May 31 on Father/Daughter Records. It’s a seven-and-a-half minute song, but it’s not really an epic in the way that length would suggest. Instead, Bofale’s spidery guitar lines sit and spin around one another, as she sings about being “pregnant with fear.” It moves, but slowly, forcing you to sit in the feelings as the song flows around you. It’s a style that suits the things she’s been concerned with writing songs about since she was a kid. Bofale grew up around music, taping songs off the radio and playing instruments that ended up around the house as she moved away from San Antonio and back again. The real spark happened when she first picked up a guitar, and realized that songs were something she could take ownership of herself. She started writing about “songs about crushes, not feeling loved/understood, classic tween angst things.”  In a way, those are still the things she sings about today, but as a 22-year-old, her perspective is a little deeper. She sings not just of lost love, but of the ways those feelings can derail your life, and leave you feeling lost in the world. She asks big questions that don’t have easy answers.Bofale opens the record’s closer “Where to Go” with a pair of brutal queries: “How do I keep going / How do I hang on?” It makes sense, in a way that these are feelings you might want to explore in less evidently pop structures. If there aren’t pithy answers, it makes sense to linger in them, to turn them over—to spend a little time in the pit. Bofale explained that she was “in the trenches: of a dark place when she wrote “Where to Go.”  “My depression is definitely a part of my everyday life and some days are worse than others—those days in particular were worse and worser,” she said. “I was taking antidepressants and trying to figure out what the next step was. How do I find the allure in tomorrow? How long is it until I feel better? My depression consumed me and I consumed it.”  The resultant song is a moving depiction of the confusion, stretching outward desperately, looking for answers over these circuitous guitar arpeggios that kinda feel like being stuck in quicksand. The record has its share of lighter moments too though, like “Origami Dreams,” which is premiering here today. In the video, Bofale smiles before amidst greenery, pastels and flowers, folding paper and playing along to the song, a jaunty rock song with its share of unfurling guitar leads that wouldn’t feel out of place on a Felt record, or a Captured Tracks release from the early part of this decade. It feels joyous and light, even if its backstory isn’t really.  The song describes a friendship-turned-doomed-relationship, and Bofale’s desire for things to just flip back to the way things were before. “I decided to put it on the record because at the end of the day, this record is about love,” she said. “It's about other things too, but love is definitely one of the major arteries or something. Love you need to find the strength to move on from, love you didn't want, love for yourself you need to search for without a map, love that didn't come in quite the way you bargained for.“ She says “Origami Dreams” isn’t necessarily any less intense than the rest of the record. But then that makes sense, the heavy stuff doesn’t last forever. Some days are better than others. “Origami Dreams” is moving in the way it presents those bad feelings in a more comfortable environment: “This time the windows are down and it's summertime.”.

" Dance music is very often referred to as body music for reasons that are intuitive. In the most literal sense, it moves you, but there's a potential for more, something beyond the sights and smells of the darkened dancefloor. On the cover of the debut LP by the Vancouver techno duo Minimal Violence is an all caps couplet that outlines this whole philosophy: THE BODY IS MEAT / THE MIND IS UNLIMITED. Their album is called  InDreams, and its built around the hallucinatory energy that comes from hardware electronics firing fast and heavy. You want to move, but there's something ascendant about it too. Other producers and DJs have explained this metaphysical rave experience as a way of communing with the divine, but Minimal Violence have it right, comparing it to the world of dreams. Utilizing a ""haphazard"" collection of hardware, they're able to create pieces with surreal logics, interlocking and interacting in ways that shouldn't make sense, linking distant worlds and creating new ones. It's best evidenced on tracks like ""June Anthem,"" which employ melodies catchy enough for pop structures, but twist them around this impossibly fast drum programming. It takes something that feels familiar and turns it into something otherworldly—electronic music as a way of seeing past the mundanity of the physical world.   InDreams is one of the best techno full-lengths in recent memory, so it's exciting that the duo—made up of the producers Ashlee Luk and Lida P.—were able to celebrate it with this week's Noisey Mix. The set they put together is a little different than the record; it's a little slower, a little slinkier. But it's no less transcendent as they transition from the slow motorik of some workmanlike techno, through brutalist EBM, and off-kilter post-punk. It's all heady and heavy, exactly the sort of stuff that'll help you move beyond this meatspace and embrace your psychic destiny. Listen below alongside a conversation with the duo about the philosophies behind their record.  Noisey: How are we meant to enjoy the mix? What's the perfect setting.Minimal Violence: We’re currently sitting in a cabin at the foot of a ridge in Joshua Tree at sundown listening back to this mix and it feels like the perfect setting. I feel like whenever we are making music or a mix we are thinking about night drives down quiet stretches of roadway, or running. This is not a running mix.  Was there any specific concept to the mix?I find that we have a habit of sourcing new tracks for every mix / DJ set as opposed to going through our archives. Rekordbox was giving us technical difficulties so we started digging through our usb's for tracks that fit a mood we were trying to conjure, slower tracks that we hadn't fit into mixes before and picking through some records. We always try to pay homage to Vancouver’s musical history, aside from that we ended up with an interesting combination of some new stuff alongside some dark post-punk jams next to some untitled break-driven test pressings.  Do you have a favorite moment on this mix?There is this perfect moment at 35:20 of the mix when the tail of Chaos Engine lets out in a scream and the first kick of Oazis comes in that is particularly satisfying.  Is synesthesia a real thing? If so, what color is this mix?We had a sound art class once with a girl with synesthesia, she talked about it a lot. Apparently it's real. I can't say either of us are tuned into that, but if we were then I’m heading towards the feeling that this mix would be purple.  Your record is called   InDreams, can you talk a bit about the power that dreams hold for you either in your lived experience or as a metaphor? Have you had any dreams recently that enlightened you about waking life?At a young age we were both obsessed with the idea of lucid dreaming as a form of escape. I actually recently came across a book I had found as a child titled  Dream Power, that delved into these ideas. I think the commonality of our interest in these experiences with lucid dreaming brought us towards this concept. We both have had dreams recently where the emotional experience within the dreamworld transcended into waking life. I feel like it’s in moments like this where the potential for fluidity between the two worlds most clearly exists.   There's such a bruising energy to much of this record, what draws you to fast tempos and minimal melodies? What feelings or themes does something like ""June Anthem"" allow you to access. Or are you even thinking about it on that level?I think we’re drawn to faster tempos because it allows the potential to be more impulsive and visceral when playing live. There’s a more immediate feeling to how people are experiencing the music and you kind of feed off of it. The interest in melodies ties in with the feelings that are generated by tracks like ""June Anthem."" I feel like there is a certain anthemic quality that we are drawn to— unapologetic melodic leaning that borders on earworm in its ideal state. Melodies help connect you to a time and place, I feel like a lot of dance music lacks this. There is no connection to the psychic/emotional, only the physical.  The cover of the record draws a distinction between physical reality and psychic reality. In what ways is your music invested in exploring that idea? I think it's funny in some ways that techno gets called a kind of ""body music"" but people also talk about it in mystic terms.I think this distinction is something we will attempt to focus on in future works. Right now let’s just say that we’re thinking of, say, the immediate bodily effect of a heavy and steady kick versus the melody that contains a nostalgic quality that might carry you to the first time you ever heard a track. I guess the “body” aspect of techno music is focused on the literal, whereas the “mystic” refers to the transcendental experience many encounter on the dancefloor.  Both of you made music in other projects before Minimal Violence—what do you feel excited about in the music you make together that you haven't been able to capture elsewhere?This project allows us to explore another side of our connection to one another and I feel like that is something that neither of us could ever do within any other projects. There’s a certain kind of brutal honesty that occurs when working creatively with your partner that spares no feelings and pushes you both beyond your comfort zone.Sign up for the best of VICE, delivered to your inbox daily.",articles,"['Dance', 'InDreams', '""', 'InDreams', 'Chaos Engine', 'InDreams']"
"Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty ImagesEvery week, the Noisey staff puts together a list of the best and most important albums, mixtapes, and EPs from the past seven days. Sometimes it includes projects we’ve written about on the site already; sometimes it's just made up of great records that we want everyone to hear, but never got the chance to write about. The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.IGORTyler, the Creator has a few ideas as to how you should enjoy his just-released album  IGOR. Stay far, far away from Twitter. Listen all the way through, ideally with no distractions—but definitely without your phone nearby. Avoid message boards at all costs, and a loud volume is ideal, too, whether it be through headphones or speakers. There are probably less precious ways to dictate the conditions in which your new album is heard, but Tyler is not wrong.  IGOR is a masterful work by a polymath, an architect of an entire universe that coheres more clearly with each release. The Playboi Carti-assisted ""EARFQUAKE"" is a highlight, as is the psychedelic disco-funk of ""WHAT'S GOOD."" But trying to tease out specific moments in the uninterrupted flow of  IGOR is a fool’s errand. Tyler was right. This is an assemblage of scattered ideas that coalesce into something bigger. Unlike anything else in his discography,  IGOR shows Tyler untethered and at ease. Look what happens when you log off of Twitter.  —Will SchubeDedicatedIt's been nearly five long years since Carly Rae Jepsen released E·MO·TION, her critically beloved third album and the bearer of many a banger about painful crushing, schoolgirl longing, and never quite getting what you want. Now, on  Dedicated, we see a sultrier side of Jepsen—one who isn't afraid to overtly reference more adult dalliances. Jepsen said in an interview that her biggest influence for these songs was Donna Summer, but there are also bits of early-aughts synth pop, 80s glam, and 70s roller-rink anthems to be found here. On ""Want You in My Room,"" she croons, ""Don't go / the night's not over / On the bed / on the floor / I don't care anymore;"" on ""Party for One,"" she revels in masturbatory solitude. ""Too Much,"" one of the standout tracks, brings to mind not-so-distant throwbacks like Annie and The Knife, and she ups her annunciation and matures her lovelorn angst. Maybe she finally got what she wanted, and realized that requited love ain’t always what it’s cracked up to be.  —Hilary PollackFeverDon't look now, but Megan Thee Stallion just released one of the best rap albums of the year. The first woman signed to 300 Entertainment might be the biggest thing to come out of Houston in the last decade (Travis Scott doesn't count; he was born on the internet) and if you didn't already know her name, you definitely know it now. On Fever, the influence of fellow Texas legends UGK and southern rap icons Three 6 Mafia are readily apparent. In a direct nod to those influences, the album includes a verse from Juicy J on album standout ""Simon Says,"" and ""W.A.B."" is a fresh take on Three 6 Mafia's ""Weak Azz Bitch,"" that flips the song with Megan's own flavor. Consider this her coronation. —Leslie Horn I Am Easy To FindThe National have become one of the foremost active American bands by largely sticking to their guns with subtle tweaks at their grand and melancholic alternative rock. Over eight albums and almost two decades as an active band, their latest  I Am Easy To Find is a creative leap that proves how they’ve managed to maintain their success. It’s a cinematic LP, not just because it was made in collaboration with  20th Century Women director Mike Mills, who made an Alicia Vikander-starring short film as a companion piece. The production is lush and densely orchestrated with songs like “Rylan” standing among the band’s finest offerings. —Josh Terry EssentialsThough its songs were all written around the same period of time, Essentials flows like a 'Best of' CD (a fact that its title knowingly nods at), each track packed tight with immediately addictive hooks and laced with all the tinny hi-hats and liquid synths of a lost Brandy album.But if the sound is retro, de Casier’s concerns definitely aren't; on ""Good Time,"" she sings about the role that phones play in our modern conceptions of romance. “Don’t write it in a message / Just say it to my face,"" she pleads before the chorus cuts straight to the heart of the never-ending DM dance: As she sings ""I had a really, really, really, really, really good time,"" you can practically feel her typing out each ""really,"" praying that it sounds sincere. —Sam Goldner,  ""Erika de Casier's R&B Feels Like Hitting the Club with an Old Friend""Injury ReserveArizona’s punk-rap pit-starters come into their own as zoners on this thoughtful and varied self-titled effort. So intent on disrupting your expectations that they get fellow fire starter Rick Nasty to murmur over a bear that sounds like Japanese environmental music, this trio adopts a rap-smarter-not-harder approach. They pare back the seasick distortion and 808 firebombs in favor of cheeky samples—like the speech-to-text “how to make a song” instructions that open “Rap Song Tutorial” or the Teriyaki Boyz riff on “Jailbreak the Tesla”—and casual barbs at biters, influencer-types, and the industry old guard who has little hope to understand them. Still when they rage, they rage hard, as on the Cakes Da Killa and JPEGMAFIA noise-rave ""GTFU,"" upon which they repeatedly implore their listeners to ""get the fuck up."" You'd be wise to listen to them.  —Colin Joyce Hot SpringThe stunningly pastoral arrangements on  Hot Spring transcend the anxiety-laced malaise throughout. The plaintive ""Here Comes The Snow"" gorgeously ambles to make for one of Radcliffe's most beautiful songs yet especially when he sings, ""Some people do the dance with death just to learn how to live."" Though the pedal steel and the guitars echo the touchstones of Cosmic American Music, the LP is hardly a country album. Single ""Bloodletting"" belies its pretty composition, full of lush strings and Lyons' wailing pedal steel as Radcliffe sings, ""Missiles dancing in the clouds that waterboarded roofs below / Peace and love were nice while they lasted, but now it’s time to lock and load."" —Josh Terry, “Spencer Radcliffe and Everyone Else Chuckle at the Void on Their New Album” Weeping ChoirI have never been hit in the chest harder than the time I saw Full of Hell open for Nails. Some big cargo shorts fuck spin-kicking with reckless abandon lost control of his flailing limbs and planted a big meaty forearm right in my sternum, knocking the wind out of me and nearly sending me tumbling to the floor of one of the worst rooms to see live music in Manhattan, sure I was facing certain death at the sole of a Doc Martens boot. I survived, but that blunt force is a pretty decent metaphor for the grindy noise that Full of Hell has morphed into over the years.  Weeping Choir finds their take on hardcore getting ever more gnarled and weird, which paradoxically only allows it to hit harder. It's full of feedback and noise and twisted field recordings, which only add to the disorienting effect of the punishment. Approach with caution, be ready to get stomped on.  —Colin Joyce Dozakh: All Lovers HellAs a tried-and-true punk raised in a small Swedish town by Iranian parents, Nadia Tehran knows alienation. ""Everybody wants to belong to something,"" she said in an interview with Paper magazine earlier this week. ""We're a whole generation growing up like you and me and our friends and our families who have this sense of rootlessness and feel like they exist in a gap or some kind of void that you inherit."" Her debut full-length  Dozakh: All Lovers Hell feels like an attempt at tracing all the contours of that void both in personal and universal terms. Most of the songs here feel like they're about searching for connection and the things that prevent such connection from being possible. ""Down"" spells out these themes most explicitly: ""I try, but I'm still not down / I'm still not down."" She adopts a lot of different styles across, darting from jittery sound poetry to airy ballads to punkish rippers that wouldn't feel out of place on a Yeah Yeah Yeahs record. It makes sense in a way. The void doesn't have borders, why should her sound?  —Colin Joyce Readjusting the LocksThese days, everyday dread is coupled with the march toward another election cycle, in which, Institute singer Moses Brown says, no one seems equipped for ""writing truly effective policy"" or upholding existing ideas—like the Green New Deal or Universal Basic Income—that could stand to truly improve the lives of marginalized people in the country and around the world. This is the backdrop for  Readjusting the Locks, 13 tracks more anxious and upset than Institute has ever felt before. It’s their third record for Sacred Bones, and it’s the most wound-up and unsettled by a long shot. Press materials cite '77 punk as a possible reference point, but that doesn't really seem to capture the spirit of it—not exactly. Those bands were having a good time, and this record—even at its most ""rockin'"" moments, like the chugging opener ""MPS""—has this undertone of dread. You can hear it in the way the rhythms sorta unravel, or in Brown’s wheezy resignation. There’s this feeling that everything might not be alright in the end. — Colin Joyce,  ""Institute’s Freak-Punk Tries to Make Sense of a Disorienting World""Ryan PollieAs Los Angeles songwriter Ryan Pollie was gearing to finish his excellent self-titled solo LP, his first since he dropped the moniker Los Angeles Police Department, a cancer diagnosis turned his life upside down. Though he had already been asking big questions in his already written lyrics, like on the spiritually intense ""Aim Slow,"" his song ""Only Child"" directly deals with his illness. Pollie singing, ""the benadryl IV has my head turned around/my hair is falling out/my parents are calling now."" It's a heavy listen considering the circumstances but Pollie has an effortless interpretation of '70s rock 'n' roll, taking as many cues from Harry Nillson as he does the hushed intimacy of contemporaries like Sufjan Stevens. He's quietly put out some of the most heart-rending folk inspired tunes this half-decade and even without overcoming his health struggle, this would be his most resilient collection yet.  —Josh TerryBig Day EP Slow Pulp formed in Madison but decamped to Chicago last fall. Their expansive and atmospheric rock that can turn from taking cues from surging '90s alternative to folky quiet in an instant. Their latest EP  Big Day finds the band picking up where they left off on their soaring 2018 single ""Steel Birds."" Here there are big choruses, loud guitars, and soothingly disorienting vocals from lead singer Emily Massey. Opener ""Do You Feel It"" slowly evolves into a grandiose freakouts with galloping drums, searing lead guitars before abruptly fading out while ""High"" maintains its fire-breathing intensity with overpowering bass and chugging riffs. Even as the arrangements bounce all over the place, Massey’s voice is the anchor that keeps it centered.  —Josh TerryCorrection: A previous version of this post misquoted a lyric from Nadia Tehran's ""Down.""

"Photo by Peter Dupont Watching the music video for Erika de Casier’s intoxicating G-funk single “Do My Thing” feels like discovering a pop star before they’ve realized they’re a pop star. The homemade, down-to-earth video follows de Casier, clad in a bike helmet as she pedals around Copenhagen, chewing gum and giving off the kind of comfortable smile that seems genuinely happy just to be out for another late night in the city. By the end of the video, she’s at the club with her friend, taking blurry selfies and dancing away in the crowd—just like one of us. “It’s important for me that people can be comfortable around me, and vice versa,” the Danish vocalist/producer tells me via email in advance of her sublime debut album  Essentials, which we’re premiering ahead of its official release this week. “If I projected some chilly, distant image, I wouldn’t be able to live up to that in person. I want people to see me as I am.” For the past several years, de Casier has orbited around Danish house collective Regelbau, lending her voice to remixes by local figureheads DJ Central and DJ Sports and performing as one half of nocturnal soul duo Saint Cava. But for her debut solo release under her own name, she’s taken on a much more personal sound.  Essentials hits like vintage Sade remastered in pristine HD, channeling the iciest strains of '90s R&B while whispering with the type of laptop-chopped bedroom stylings you might hear from Tirzah, or possibly de Casier’s friends in Smerz. Though its songs were all written around the same period of time,  Essentials flows like a ‘Best of’ CD (a fact that its title knowingly nods at), each track packed tight with immediately addictive hooks and laced with all the tinny hi-hats and liquid synths of a lost Brandy album. But if the sound is retro, de Casier’s concerns definitely aren’t; on “Good Time,” she sings about the role that phones play in our modern conceptions of romance. “Don’t write it in a message / Just say it to my face,” she pleads before the chorus cuts straight to the heart of the never-ending DM dance: As she sings “I had a really, really, really, really, really good time,” you can practically feel her typing out each “really,” praying that it sounds sincere.  “I’m not against phones,” de Casier tells me. “I don’t see my family so much because we live really far apart, so it’s nice that I can see parts of my sisters’ lives without actually being there. And of course Tinder and Grindr are bringing people closer together every day. But if I am in the same room as someone, I try to look them in the eye.” There’s something else about that pre-smartphone innocence of the ‘90s that really speaks to de Casier. “I think it’s just because that was the music I was listening to as a teenager,” she says. “It takes me back to a time of daydreaming, and less worries.” While de Casier’s certainly not the only artist feeling the late-‘90s nostalgia set in as our current era only seems to be growing darker, her music is much more than just MTV pastiche.  There’s a genuine optimism to  Essentials, an affectionate understanding of how its classic intersection of mainstream pop, soul music, and club ideals can make a potent cocktail for facing the world with a smile. Listening to it imparts the same wide-eyed hope you get as you set out into the city at 1 a.m., soaking in all the romance and possibilities of the night.

"Screenshot from NPR's Tiny DeskIf Lucky Daye's Tiny Desk Concert is a preview of what his career holds, R&B fans should rejoice. The New Orleans native stopped by NPR's not-so-Tiny Desk show to sing a medley from his debut album, Painted, released last week.

For fans who have been following Daye since he released I, his first EP, last December, the Tiny Desk Concert is everything you find in his records—equal parts R&B and funk, with a touch of swagger found among his contemporaries.

The result is neither comprehensive nor fair. We hope it helps.Father of the Bride Father of the Bride is freewheeling and idiosyncratic, it bounces from their trademark baroque pop to rock and country and folk, bending each new sound to their will. It has moody experimentalism (“My Mistake”) and shaggy, jittery psychedelia (“Sunflower”). It features no fewer than three sun-soaked Danielle Haim duets—one sounds like a Disney song in a good way (“We Belong Together”) and one in a bad way (“Married In a Gold Rush”). The third punctuates its verses with a stunning sample from Hans Zimmer’s score for  The Thin Red Line. —Alex Swhear, ""Vampire Weekend's New Album Is All Over the Place, In the Best Way""U.F.O.F.Big Thief’s first two albums 2016’s  Masterpiece and 2017’s  Capacity catapulted the New York band on the strength of their hushed intensity and overwhelmingly workhorse-like tour routing. Though 2018 found lead singer Adrianne Lenker and guitarist Buck Meek releasing solo albums but their third, the understated and near-mystical  U.F.O.F. is their most fully-formed yet. The band has always excelled at finding emotional catharsis in intimate, quiet moments but here, the arrangements seamlessly flow through the tracklist. Their folk-rock palette expands into lusher, more atmospheric territory like on the plaintive “Open Desert” and the dirge-like “Jenni.” But on the title track, Lenker sings of alien disappearances and loss with, “she’s taking up root in the sky / see her flickering / her system won’t even try. It’s a stunning portrait of what’s Cosmic American Music can be in 2019.  —Josh TerryVoicemailsVoicemails is the Chicago artist’s follwup to 2018’s Pain & Pleaure, and it’s a solid reminder that Tink is the mixtape queen, with seven under her belt to date. This 12-track project finds Tink in a confessional state and at her most relatable. “You been on my bad side, but I ain’t even gonna act like I don’t want you here with me,” she sings on “Bad Side.” That line alone says a lot about what it’s like to be a woman in her 20s. Other highlights include “Ride It,” which features a verse from Dej Loaf ; “I Wanna Be Down,” an interpolation of Brandy’s 1994 debut single of the same name; and “Stabbed in the Back” which is an anthem for anyone who’s ever been scorned. Tink’s been there. And that’s why she’s so good at this. — Leslie HornGreen and Gray Green and Gray feels like a natural outgrowth of the sounds the band was exploring on 2017’s  A Hairshirt of Purpose. But while there are more genteel abstractions throughout the record, it also features some of the band’s most disgustingly savage compositions in their history, as Maguire unleashes his pent-up political frustrations in a way that’s direct but not heavy-handed. Yet, at the same time,  Green and Gray offers the most transparent view of Rick Maguire himself. Songs like “Firewood” and “My Employer” see him no longer using narrators as vehicles for his own emotions, as he plumbs the depths of his experience and puts the discoveries on full display.  —David Anthony,  ""Pile’s Rick Maguire Gave Up Everything for His Band and He’d Do It All Again""Happy To Be HereBarrie Lindsay, who fronts the New York City quintet Barrie, creates an expertly lush and candy-hued landscape of dream pop on the band’s debut album  Happy To Be Here. The grooves and hooks that permeate throughout are so effortless these already obviously infectious songs unfold on deeper listens. “Darjeeling” bubbles with atmospheric synths and Barrie’s opening line “the city towed my car the first night I got in.” According to a press statement, her car was actually was towed but she surprisingly felt happy about it because she had just moved to NYC. It’s this optimism that drives the LP and makes it so inviting like on the funky “Geology” and the vibing “Chinatown.”  —Josh TerryNight on EarthEmpath present as punks, but their debut LP proves a truth hidden in the delirious fuzz of their early EPs: they’re great pop songwriters too. Their take on basement rock tropes is still utterly blown out—a decade ago we might have called this shitgaze—but they're able to wring these wonderful floaty melodies out of the static. One Noisey writer (hi Josh) compared the breathy melodies of ""Roses That Cry"" to Broken Social Scene, and I haven’t been able to get that comparison out of my head since. Like Kevin Drew, they couch desperate longing in labyrinthine guitar pop, finding ecstasy in the fail points—like when singer Catherine Elicson runs out of air or her voice slides from croon to scream. It's beautiful and broken.  —Colin JoyceCrisis SigilRook, half the bleak pop duo Black Dresses, introduces a new project Crisis Sigil, with five short, shredded tracks. For fans of her band, this'll be familiar emotional territory—rage, abjection, fear—but Crisis Sigil uses new means to get there. Throughout she thrashes and grinds, crafting a cybernetic version of hardcore, all on her own. It's contorted and coated in digital grime in a way that reminds me of the noise-scuffed record Full of Hell made with Merzbow. But overall there's something even more ascendant about it, a reminder of the power you can find in negation. Turn the bullshit into fuel.— Colin JoyceUseless CoordinatesTheir debut album  Useless Coordinates on Captured Tracks is a 10-track collection of erratic, paranoid-feeling songs that feel guided less by structure than by pure nervous energy. The songs feel plotted, but loosely, like someone trying to draw a map to a riff from memory. Riggs seems to suggest that this is inherent to their approach. “I find [the painter] Francis Bacon’s impulsive methods of working encapsulate creative energy in its purest form,” bassist Rob Riggs says. “His instinctive outbursts of emotion are captured directly to the canvass, uninterrupted for eternity. I think our approach to songwriting is very primitive and reactionary, there is no predestination.” — Colin Joyce,  ""Drahla’s Abstract Punk Songs Are Ecstatic About the Everyday""Papaya!Chicago rapper and producer Malci has been thriving on the local hip-hop community’s fringes for the past few years. His new tape  Papaya! is his best, an entirely self-produced collection, that is adventurously weird and compelling. When he raps, he throws his voice around in unexpected ways, landing one liners with an erratic energy like on “Money Store,” where in its short runtime he masterfully sputters over a glitchy beat. Of the 17 tracks on  Papaya! only two crack the three minute mark making for a blistering run of left-field production and heady pop culture references ranging from “Broken Social Scene,” “Trout Mask Replica” to “Legacy of Kain.” Malci doesn’t enlist any features and though he doesn’t get the cosigns of his more-established peers, he’s better as an outsider.  —Josh TerryI'll Miss YouThe New York-based duo Bathe's surf R&B draws from the inspiration of the Beach Boys, redefining who gets to enjoy the sun and sand. Their concept of summer music emulates the short-lived high of a vacation, with the truth that real life awaits you when the sun sets. I'll Miss You, a 7-track EP, follows Corey and Dev through the whirlwind of a summer romance that ends as quickly as it began: the meeting (""Dealer""), the fall (""Kimmi""), and the recovery (""Sure Shot""). ""I won't spend no time, obsessing over signs / I don't regret the night I spent with you,"" Dev sings on ""Kimmi."" In the end, a summer without memories is not a summer well spent. —Kristin CorryEcstatic ComputationOn her first record for the experimental institution Editions Mego, the Italian synthesist Caterina Barbieri lets her modular geometry blur lysergically. She’s long been a master of pristine, interlocking synth sequences—austere and striking like a Malevich painting—but what’s here is mistier and more diffuse. From the start of the albums opener ""Fantas,"" her synth work bleeds and swells, less like marking out shapes on a canvas than dripping single drops of paint into puddles. There’s something special in that unpredictable fluid motion.  —Colin JoycePacific Breeze: Japanese City Pop, AOR & Boogie 1976-1986City Pop, the saccharine, sleek, and endlessly listenable music from the economically prosperous years of ‘70s and ‘80s Japan has long been having a resurgence.

"“HONEYCOMB” hits the sweet spot between jitwam’s work in dance music and efforts as a bandleader, connecting people in-studio and on-stage. The record encapsulates his diverse upbringing in India and Australia, before living in monasteries in Thailand, orphanages in South Africa, and finally the US, where he currently resides. With his roots in Assam, northeast India, and his hustle now based in Brooklyn, the psychedelic soul-savant known as jitwam. will officially drop his second album on the Copenhagen-based label Tartelet Records in May 2019. To mark its release, a music video to the album’s opener “busstop” was shot in the exhilarating city of Mumbai across three days. On jitwam’s journey, he’s worn several musical faces that all highlight soulful sounds within the world of psychedelic indie rock, the hip-hop realm, and underground house music. These sounds and musical identities are apparent in his 12-track album of broken microphone blues, heartfelt vocals, and smooth assorted instrumentation. It follows jitwam’s well-received EPs on his own imprint, The Jazz Diaries, which secured him a spot on Moodymann’s DJ Kicks compilation. “HONEYCOMB” was recorded at the Steam Room Sessions studio in London, where Natureboy Flako lent his special touch to jitwam’s tracks across some intimate collaborative sessions. We’re left with sonic “diary entries” that put a magnifying glass on life’s mundane moments, turning them into inspired tales of life, love, sadness, and periods of ecstatic release. Album opener “busstop” finds him welcoming you into his world with warm guitar riffs, smooth basslines, and lyrics about the comforting chaos of urban life in India. Features are aplenty on the LP too: London artist Marie Bashiru adds croons to the buttery “diamonds” and “temptations”; trumpet is worked in by Henry Wu-collaborator Nick Walton; and frequent Brooklyn-based collaborator Aquiles Navarro features on the lullaby jam “hearts don’t lie.” Hazy 90s hip-hop drums and warm synths bring the listener into “i’m a rock.” Going even deeper, jazz-funk enters the room on “trustt,” a tune that’s all groovy basslines and cosmic soundscapes. “opendoors” brings up the energy for one of the LP’s most full on, hands-up trips; it’s a mix of buzzing horns and uplifting vocals about the possibilities to be found in any moment if you just let go – and let loose. “HONEYCOMB” frees jitwam from any parameters of a dance floor 12-inch. It blasts open the doors for an artist who fuses musical identities and stitches together ideas into some of the warmest music you’ll hear all year.

The scientist uses certain instruments and methods. He constructs his instruments by working upon what nature gives him. Slugabed’s practice also uses an instrument, but in this case the instrument is man himself.

"Steffen Schröder continues to inspire in his signature emotive translation. The Berlin-based musician usually finagles elements of glitch, IDM, and post-industrial fragments, however, with In The Range Of Imagination, Huron delves into mysterious trajectories taking the shape of drone and dark-ambient. That is not to say that these nine slices of life merit a simple genre-tag, on the contrary—Huron is able to extract sheer emotion in its 72-minute transit time.From the lilting and pleasant drifts of “Orange Air,” its fading childhood voices create a nostalgic dream for which we cannot escape—the echoes launch into wide open spaces for each listener to grasp at. “Cloud Machine” takes on a darker form, its drone passes through a heavy fog that simply will not lift—piano keys and glitch elements begin to take shape where fans of The Future Sound Of London may find solace. But just when you thought there might be a loss of beats to deliver this albums’ message, “The Path” comes along to enrich the soul—its Gridlock-inspired synapse is one of broken post-industrial bits and bytes that somehow maneuver through a myriad of dark and light corridors. Elsewhere one can find gray clouds forming just over the horizon as long stretches of ambient mysteries unfold by the minute on “Misty And Cold.”In The Range Of Imagination, mainly inspired by Schröder’s son, transcends time and space—its soothing wall of beautiful noises coalesce in the intermediate color spectrum between black and white, a neutral zone of non-color that raises the bar once again for this prolific musician as he continues to hover on an entirely otherworldly plane.In The Range Of Imagination is available on Bandcamp.in the range of imagination by h][uron",articles20,"['The Berlin', 'The Future Sound Of London', 'Gridlock', 'Schröder’s']"
"It’s become a peculiar contradiction that every review of a new Yagya album reads the same, from opening precis through descriptive passages to closing remarks. Why? Because each new Yagya album offers a completely fresh take on his existing sound, spinning his familiar timbres and dub techno tropes in new, intriguing and often surprising ways. Happily, Stormur is no exception to the rule.No matter how much some fans might wish for (or indeed openly moan about not getting) Rhythm of Snow or Rigning soundalikes over and over again, Yagya has never chased the limelight, instead choosing to uncompromisingly evolve and experiment. It’s a working practice that continues to deliver a diverse experience, one that’s not centered around forging a canon with universal appeal.And yet Stormur does heavily call back to his sophomore and perhaps most highly regarded album Rigning in numerous ways, with ten sequentially and thematically named tracks based this time not on rain but the storm.This is Yagya’s debut full length for A Strangely Isolated Place, and like several other releases on the label, is a surprising choice given its ambient roots. As the title suggests, Stormur is a much more turbulent ride than any of his previous works, the BPM count significantly ramped up, embracing less of the dub and more of the techno elements of previous albums. Rigning and Sleepygirls might have been presented themselves as continuous albums, but on Stormur Yagya is embracing the DJ aesthetic, with each track mixed together seamlessly as full DJ-style set.“Stormur Eitt” opens with familiar lush pads and ambient field recordings, a tendril neatly connecting this album to Rigning just as the track comes across as a techno remix of “Rigning Einn.” But it’s mere moments before the beat fully kicks in, a gentle introduction to the full-on set that is to follow, and the last recognisably “dub” element of Yagya’s usual style that you’ll hear on Stormur.“Stormur Tvö” through “Stormur Fjögur” feature surprising trance elements and even guitar-esque flourishes that recall particularly intense System 7 works, with “Stormur Þrjú” introducing ethereal, whispered ambient vocal passages by Hatis Noir an almost motorik track that wouldn’t sound out of place on a Wipeout soundtrack.Hypnotic, dancefloor-friendly, minimal and tautly programmed drum patterns become the primary focus and by “Stormur Fimm” Yagya is really digging deep into techno tropes, the pace picking up and the beats becoming denser and heftier. It’s the end of part one, in a sense, as “Stormur Sex” slows things right back down with ambient washes and Noir’s vocals dominating, before “Stormur Sjö” chugs and thuds to life, the sounds of those Wipeout race cars heard cornering hard in the background.The timbres become angular, icy and spectral on “Stormur Átta,” then warm and glowing on “Stormur Níu,” inviting the throng back onto the dancefloor before finally bowing out with almost Vatican Shadow-like ferocity, machine-gun snares firing salvo after salvo over a thudding and relentless bass drum, building to a cataclysmic apex and then fading away in its final moments against a familiar melodic motif.Like previous reviews of records released by A Strangely Isolated Place, there’s once again nice bonuses and dedication to suitability of format on the label’s edition of Stormur. In a similar vein to Sleepygirls released by Delsin before it, buying Stormur on vinyl gets you different edits of each of the tracks, as it’s obviously not possible to present them as a continuous mix on the format. You also get not just a digital download of the mixed version, but a full CD in printed card wallet (also available separately). Like 36’s Fade To Grey on ASIP earlier this year, this kind of generosity of content is a luxurious bonus.Stormur may not appeal to certain staunch Yagya veterans looking for more of his lush dub techno, but it’s a bold and full-blooded techno excursion executed with considerable elan.

"Velum Break (aka Birmingham-based Richard Breedon) punches through bass bins with the utterly fantastic Bench Manoeuvres on Touched Music, a collection of surreal braindance breaks, acid, electro, IDM, and mind-altering low-end. Martin Boulton (Touched Music label-head) met Breedon at a Plaid event in 2018—fast-forward to 2019, and he signs him with this blisteringly well-crafted debut album. Here we see a myriad of corrosive rhythms ricochet against a breakcore backdrop, but what the artist does in abundance is collect high-energy melodies and a vast assortment heavy percussion—smashing them together in nine cohesive arrangements that are nothing short of addictive. Each track manages to elicit abstract broken beats and undulating bass while weaving sweet musicalities effortlessly.Fans of Squarepusher, Plaid, and Luke Vibert’s scorched acidic terrain will easily find Bench Manoeuvres a welcomed addition. With its dance-floor ready and headphone capable grooves, Bench Maneuvers delivers on all fronts as it dives straight to the top of our Best Of 2019 releases.

"Has Scorn existed forever? It seems like it sometimes. Originating decades ago as a member of Napalm Death, he has weathered the ages by constantly updating his sound with the latest technology and techniques, while still remaining unmistakably the same dark pit of abrasion it ever was. Maybe the closest comparison is Justin Broadrick who has a similar sonic history and range of output, but Scorn always seems to be a little slower, a little more empty and nihilistic in place of Broadrick’s rage and misery. And the bass—always the omnipresent bass in everything but rarely a sharp, commercial-sounding trendy dubstep/neurofunk riff. No, more like dying pulses of collapsing stars, pulverizing classic industrial bass waves here. Maybe if you time stretched Technical Itch tracks out to a hundred times their original length? Some sort of ancient ritual during which a factory full of machines the size of oil tankers slowly destroys itself? A flock of huge stone birds circling above a black hole? This is a stupidly low-end heavy series of tracks topped with drifting ambient spaces of dark voids. It works really well as a intro to what Scorn has been up to, and might even make you want to check out his other vast catalog of delights.Feather by ScornLong time veteran DNB producer Submerged returns with an extended player after a bit of a quiet period. First off, let me say, this was not what I was expecting from Submerged. My experience of Submerged has always been of dark, classically styled breaks and tight programmed beats with excellent mind-altering sub-destroying bass. So, I was at first, very disappointed when this turned out to be, on my first listen, kind of one of those tragic comeback-as-the-next-daft-punk type thing. But I thought, nah, not Submerged, he co-op’ed with all these different guys, I’ve loved stacks of his tunes, I’ll go back and listen to this from another angle. And I get it now, what Submerged is trying to do here is to take every different dialect of hardcore and express it through his own personal emotional lense. He pulls it off, I’d say, over the course of four intense and wildly different tracks. “Transformation” (with Ajamari) is a trance-induced nu-school influenced track with vocals, not normally my taste at all, but managing to stay ruff enough to satisfy me nonetheless. “Cell” (with Savage) a homage to hardcore and gabber but with much too much variation to be comparable to anything but maybe Hellfish. “Surrealistic Dystopian Nightmares” (with Masamune) is a personal favorite—dystopian neurofunk from somewhere between 90’s electro and the latest Russian neurofunk hit. “Abyss” (with Molecular) is a classic old-school techstep track, loved it, what else is there to say? All in all, a solid comeback for a longtime vet, always good to see an artist trying on new styles and collaborations, and it really pays off here!The Eradication of Untruth by Submerged + Masamune",articles20,"['Napalm Death', 'Broadrick’s', 'Feather', 'Ajamari)', 'Savage', 'Masamune']"
"Here we see, feel, and hear raw noises collapse, fold and disintegrate. 14 tracks spread on 2 CD’s, Von Tesla is new to these ears (not sure how that happened), and manages to expose arcane and unusual electronic experiments that even Autechre might have playing in the background. Ganzfeld—a phenomenon of perception caused by exposure to an unstructured, uniform stimulation field—runs through a myriad of found sounds, broken pulses, disjointed glitch, and a smorgasbord of clicks and cuts.“Feedforward” delves into all of the above-mentioned sounds and filters them down to fractured bits and pieces. The ambient elevated and FSOL-inspired “Infinity Reveal” takes us through a far-away dimension—a surreal foray into unknown worlds of turbulent slivers and twisted drone sequences overlapping each other. Crossing wires, and entangling each sonic fragment, Ganzfeld feeds off itself in a way that is utterly hypnotic. “Dream Part,” for example, delves into gritty leftfield nuances via eight minutes of undulating landscapes. And this is where Von Tesla excels—the influx of modular drifting is mind-boggling as evidenced on the extended 18-minute duration of “Echoes of the End.” This track alone manages to transmit a slew of abstract electrical debris (not unlike what was discovered on Autechre’s NTS Sessions), continuing to stretch and contort itself into segmented audio collages that could have been an EP on its own. “Aftermath” engages in a parallel path yet somehow feels more enclosed with its mechanical echoes and tangled ambience. Passing through a fog of layered drones on “Lighted Room,” Von Tesla continues to showcase a dystopian world of curiosity and confusion.In all, Ganzfeld is a mysterious analog trajectory that brings together and also carefully dissects the intersection between IDM and improvised experimental electronics. Musical artifacts such as these should not be passed up, especially considering the Treviso, Italy-based imprint has published on 2xCD, Vinyl, and digital formats.Ganzfeld is available on Boring Machines.Von Tesla – Ganzfeld by Boring Machines",articles20,"['Von Tesla', 'Von Tesla', 'Von Tesla', 'Treviso', 'Boring Machines']"
"When it rains it pours. For some anyway. Following almost two years of vinyl silence Endfest hits the shelves with not one but two releases. One comes care of Cobra Club, an imprint which started its life with the excellent Marie EP by Sterk Water, with the second premiering the fledgling Onrijn.The opener comes in the off-kilter, spaced out “Den Haag (Live at de Denneweg.)” Spoken word fights with synth noodles in a quite grating homage to the dutch city. The warbling “Luchtballon” follows. Endfest adapts his vocal escapades of “Den Haag,” this time opting to cut and paste snippets into the strangely distant patchwork of brooding bars and spindly snares. The EP is jammed with music, with a running time of near thirty minutes. One of the stand-out tracks is motivated by one the masters of German machine gloom, The Mover. “Realscule Frankfurt (Waves of PCP)” does not lurch toward the jugular, instead it stalks. Incising beats cut through a foreboding melody, scored and scratched samples squawking through the shadowy thicket. The flip, interestingly, is given over to something totally different. “Lunchpauze,” coming in at twelve minutes long, maps a wandering journey through distant bleep, echoing trills and computer rumblings. A free flowing jam, the track leads the listener down an ever changing path of knob twiddling and chord changes as improvisation becomes the guide. The outro “Haags Drankgelag” is the sister piece of “Den Haag,” a misty finale of spoken word and synth noodling.Denneweg is a less centred release in comparison to Nightlife At The Forest Edge—this latest EP revelling in free wheeling abstraction. At times this can lead to a lack of focus, tracks simply wander with little tethering them to a concept or composition. The EP is also quite disjointed, long ambient interludes juxtaposed by throaty techno which might work better on an LP format rather than the limited space of a 12”. Endfest is undoubtedly an able artist, whether this debut on Onrijn displays those abilities to the full is debatable.Denneweg is available on Onrijn.",articles20,"['Endfest', 'Endfest', 'The Mover', '“Haags', 'Den Haag', 'Endfest']"
"For more than years Johan Sturesson has been crafting a unique brand of electronic music. His productivity is simply ridiculous. From, well everything under the sun as part of Frak, Sturesson has also explored more synth wave orientated sounds with Monster Apparat and, alongside Annie Gylling, as Kord. It is to the latter moniker that this able multi-talented musician and Gylling turn to for their Statement on Madrid’s Femur.The rasping rhythms of “Vilse” gets the EP pulsating. Somewhere within the thrust and parry of slicing snares and bending notes a strung out melody takes hold, guttural vocoder vocals barely piercing the dense patterns of industrially tinted percussion. Sinister basslines introduce “Spegelbild.” Pain streaked lyrics attempt to make themselves heard through these bars and strict beats, lyrics left indecipherable, drowned in feedback to leave only the ceaseless march of those threat-filled notes. “Gräns” closes. Chords judder and shudder next to distant words, words brimming with a visceral energy that is accentuated by skittering hi-hats and tripping toms. More than likely “Inexponera” is the track out of the quartet that will be getting the most airtime in our flat. Razor edge vocals race on a steady kick, accelerating through a cityscape of alienating neon streaks and casual violence. Thoroughly unwholesome.Statement has all the raw emotion of an early synth wave release. The tracks on offer bare their teeth with all the anti-social attitude of a young punk, they drip with angst and can hardly hide their contempt. A brooding 12” of darkened wave that marries all the unease of the past with the burgeoning anxiety of the present.Statement is available on Femur.Statement by KORD",articles20,"['Monster Apparat', 'Annie Gylling', 'Statement', 'Statement', 'Statement']"
